        </epigraph>
        <p>Every man in this life has a part to play,
and, leaves a footprint, seen and followed
by—some other. How well that part is
played depends very largely on the man. It
may be played loosely—carelessly—without
a thought of anything but the NOW,
the present; without any thought of its
<pb id="heard10" n="10"/>
scope in reaching, touching, or influencing
another's life. It is a footprint, nevertheless,
and <sic corr="someone">some one</sic> follows in it and is stunted
in life, perhaps for life.</p>
        <p>On the other hand that part may be
played with great care as to every detail,
with much toil in preparation, with the
thought ever in view that “no man lives to
himself alone,” but that we are building
character and making men, how careful, then
must one be in the CHOICE and USE of
the material that tends to the “making”
men.</p>
        <p>With the idea in view that “He that believeth
shall not make haste” such a one is
mindful to be diligent. “Whatsoever his
hands find to do, to do that with all his
power,” patiently, firmly, believing that
“The race is not to the swift, but to him
that endureth to the end”—such a man is
blessed in his doing, gaining knowledge, and
experience from the every-day things that
<pb id="heard11" n="11"/>
confront him, and which he masters. He,
therefore, solves the problem of real living,
learns the lesson of true success, and thus
plants such footprints on “the sands of
time” that observing ones are impressed
thereby, and encouraged to follow them,
seeing they lead to service and to honor.</p>
        <p>It is highly fitting, then, that we should
have before our youth in particular, and
ourselves in general, the histories and biographies
of men who have risen from the
depths of ordinary life, beset with hardship,
prejudice and ostracism, and in spite of all
this, with perseverance and strong determination,
have risen to the heights in the various
positions in the affairs of this life; and
that we may note the HOW they have risen,
and the WHY they have attained these
goals. These incentives can only be had in
the spoken or written narration of this
progression.</p>
        <p>Hence, it is timely that those who have so
attained should pause sufficiently long to
<pb id="heard12" n="12"/>
give a published sketch of their lives—a
footprint—that those seeing and reading
may be inspired to take hope, to labor, and
press on to the goal with the object in view
of rendering the greatest and best service to
mankind in general.</p>
        <p>Such a character is shown, and such a service
has been, and is being rendered by the
author of this little book, a man who has
kept in touch with men in all the walks of
life, no matter how lowly or degraded, or
how exalted in station, yet ever with a kind
word of encouragement, an eye of sympathy,
and a stretched-out hand to help and to lift
up.</p>
        <p>So, after many importunities and requests
by men in the various ranks of life, who
have listened to the eloquence of, and noticed
the untiring, yet effective labors of this
earnest servant of Christ, and for human uplift,
Bishop William H. Heard has yielded,
<pb id="heard13" n="13"/>
and consented to give a brief sketch of his
life—a compressed autobiography—in which
we may note his career from the “slave pen”
(twice sold as human chattel), to a representative
of this, the greatest government on
earth, as United States Minister Resident
and Consul General to Liberia, Africa—and
how from an humble “Cornfield Exhorter”
in the State of Georgia to a General Officer,
and now a Bishop in (to my mind), the
greatest Church on earth, presiding over the
First and historic district of the African
Methodist Episcopal Church.</p>
        <p>Such an autobiography can but inspire
our Race, and in a time when others would
discredit, and say we “have failed in spite
of education and religious opportunities, and
have not made good”—it is with pride that
we may deny the false statements, and point
to such lives, and to such a character of
<pb id="heard14" n="14"/>
progress as the author of this book: “From
Slavery to the Bishopric in the A. M. E.
Church.”</p>

        <head>FOREWORD</head>
        <p>Those who may read this little booklet,
<hi rend="italics">The Autobiography of my life</hi>, I hope may
be benefitted and encouraged, especially the
young men and women of our Race<sic corr=".">,</sic></p>
        <p>They can see that men make progress
without opportunity, and they ought to be
encouraged to use the opportunities they
have to make greater progress.</p>
        <p>Opportunity comes but once, if properly
used it is a great asset, if neglected the person
is the poorer for having neglected it.</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“It is bald-headed behind,</l>
          <l>When passed, cannot be grasped</l>
          <l>Therefore seize it in the front,</l>
          <l>And use it before it passes.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>This booklet is written at the request of
many friends. I have no desire to parade
who I am and what I am, because my 
<pb id="heard16" n="16"/>
defects will do that; but I do desire to help
the young people of a race so deprived of
educational and material opportunities.
While they are ten times, yea, one hundred
times better today than in the past, yet they
are not equal to other people's. My defects
are so glaring that I feel almost ashamed
to put my thoughts in print; but so much
depends upon those who have courage,
whether they have education or not, that I
am encouraged to pen these lines.</p>
        <p>The autobiography, itself will show the
depth from which the subject came and the
height he has aimed at and attained.</p>
        <p>A minister of the Gospel is an ambassador
of the Lord, and a commissioner of the High
Court of Heaven. If he can faintly proclaim
the message given, he performs a great
duty.</p>
        <p>To be a Bishop in the African Methodist
Episcopal Church is a privilege, if properly
used, that few have, so the Bishop ought to
be a man of life, and a father in Israel. He
<pb id="heard17" n="17"/>
should so conduct himself that men will be
impressed by his writings and by his words.
Therefore, as a Bishop, I am sending forth
these words of a life lived in the midst of
privation, ignorance, and slavery, hoping
that they may be a means in this enlightened
day, of helping those who have a better opportunity
and who are encouraged to use
those opportunities.</p>
        <p>The A. M. E. Church is an instrument in
this country that has done, and is doing
more for the uplift of the Race than any
instrument conditioned as it is; I, therefore
write this booklet as an A. M. E. Bishop,
using the A. M. E. Church as a vehicle to
carry it to the ends of the earth.</p>
        <p>May it be the means of extending my life
while I live, and continuing it when I am
dead.</p>

        <head>BIRTH</head>
        <p>William Henry (Harrison) Heard was
born in Elbert County, Georgia, ten miles
below Elberton Court House, and three
miles from Longstreet, a small town with
one store and Post Office.</p>
        <p>He was born in a log cabin. The logs
were cut promiscuously from small pines,
straight and crooked, and they were built
like a stable or a pen of any kind. Where
a log was too crooked, or left too large a
hole, it was “chipped out” so as to be made
to lay closer together, in the same way they
built a pig pen or horse stable. The only
difference, where they built a house for living
was, they took the bark off the trees and
chinked the cracks in winter and knocked
out the chinking in summer.</p>
        <pb id="heard20" n="20"/>
        <p>In October they would chink and daub
so as to make the house warm, and in May
they would knock out the chinking so as to
make the house cool.</p>
        <p>During this season of the year frogs, lizards,
snakes, and smaller insects would play
“hide and seek” out of one crack into the
other. At night you would just as liable
find a snake curled up in your bed taking
his rest as you were to go and take your
rest.</p>
        <p>The chimneys were built of pine sticks
daubed with mud about four to five feet
high, they were as good an entrance and
exit as the door. The house had one door
about three feet by five feet, one window
about two feet by three feet, the floor was
made of “puncheons”; that is: the slabs were
sawed off the trees intended for sawing
planks. You could count the chickens under
these houses as accurately through these
cracks as you could in the yard.</p>
        <pb id="heard21" n="21"/>
        <p>I was born June 25, 1850. This they
called at the time “Corn plowing time.” So
when they designated my age, they would
say: He was born in corn plowing time, in,
or about the year when the stars fell,“ or
some incident of note.</p>
        <p>A woman who had children regularly was
called a “breeder” in those days; and was
allowed to go home at ten o'clock in the
morning each day, again at twelve, and at
three to nurse the child; for the child was
reckoned as “property,” and therefore valuable
enough to be given this time.</p>
        <p>My mother was a farm hand, and was
considered a “breeder,” so that in plowing
time she worked right around her house, and
plowed with an old horse by the name of
“Selim.” She never went away with the rest
of the hands, two and three miles from the
house. Not my mother only, but all women
who were nursing children, were thus dealt
with. The attention to the babies was given
<pb id="heard22" n="22"/>
by the larger children, who looked after the
smaller ones.</p>
        <p>My father lived three miles away. He
would come in on Wednesday nights after
things had closed up at his home, and be
back at his home by daylight Thursday
mornings; come again Saturday night, and
return by daylight Monday morning. He
had a pass weekly from his master that gave
him this permission.</p>
        <p>The night my mother died (I was nine
years of age), I lay on a pallet next to
a cradle and rocked my infant brother who
was just five weeks old, and gave him the
bottle all night. I did this when only nine
years of age myself.</p>

        <head>FIRST AND SECOND TIMES SOLD</head>
        <p>My father, George W. Heard, was a slave
of Thomas Heard, who was reputed to be
his father. He was a blacksmith by trade,
and while he weighed only one hundred and
forty pounds, he could use a sledge hammer
as steadily and actively as a man weighing
two hundred pounds, and shoe as many
mules as any blacksmith in the county.</p>
        <p>After thirty years as a blacksmith, he
took up the trades of a wheelwright and a
carpenter, and worked at all three of these
trades twenty years before he died.</p>
        <p>He did not know figures at all, yet he
could give a bill for lumber as accurately as
a master mathematician.</p>
        <p>He never belonged to the same man that
my mother belonged to, but lived near
<pb id="heard24" n="24"/>
enough to see her once or twice a week.</p>
        <p>My mother was Pathenia Galloway; she
and her children belonged to the Galloway
estate (two boys: Wylie and George Galloway).</p>
        <p>When the boys became of age and the estate
was settled, my mother and her three
children were placed upon the auction block
and sold to the highest bidder. That man was
Lindsay Smith, who lived at Rock Fence,
in the flatwoods of Elbert County. He was
a large farmer, and owned nearly one hundred
Negroes. This was my first time sold.</p>
        <p>After two or three years at Rock Fence
a man by the name of John A. Trenchard,
principal of the high school at Elberton,
Georgia, wanted to buy a cook. He came to
Lindsay Smith, who had a woman by the
name of Harriet and her children to sell, but
Prof. Trenchard saw us children, and asked
for the woman who was the mother of these
children, and was shown my mother. There
<pb id="heard24a" n="24a"/>
<figure id="ill3" entity="heard24a"><p>MRS. PARTHENIA JONES (the mother of Bishop Heard) plowing “Old Selim” on the Plantation of Thomas Jones, in Elbert County, Ga., 1850.</p></figure>
<pb id="heard25" n="25"/>
were then four children, as Cordelia, my
youngest sister, was born, but the difference
in the sale was one thousand dollars more.
He paid the difference and purchased my
mother and her four children—Millie,
Henry, Beverly, and Delia. We went to Elberton,
my mother became the cook and two
of us, large enough to do errands, became
house servants; as Prof. Trenchard kept a
boarding house and many of the students
boarded with him.</p>
        <p>This was my second and last time to be
sold as a slave.</p>
        <p>Prof. Trenchard was an Iowa man, and
what we considered a fair master; but there
were many men in Georgia very cruel as
masters, for the law did not interfere with
a master and his slave. It had nothing to
do with his treatment of them, and there
was no law in vogue as to cruelty to animals
in those days.</p>
        <pb id="heard26" n="26"/>
        <p>I knew a man living just three miles from
us who beat a woman belonging to him to
death, and she was heavily pregnant; so he
was guilty of the murder of two, instead of
one person.</p>
        <p>Many of the masters had cruel overseers
and Negro drivers, who were allowed to beat
the Negroes, but not to take life.</p>
        <p>Many men and women resented this
cruelty, and would fight back, but the overseers
would overpower them, and the master
would stand by and see this overseer or
driver put one hundred lashes on their bare
backs and wash them down with salt and
water. The blood would run from their
heads to their heels; yet many of them were
never conquered. They would go to the
woods and stay there for months, yes, some
of them years. They would dig caves in the
<pb id="heard27" n="27"/>
ground and live in them. So they would
get the Negro hounds to trail them and catch
them; but many of them would take a
scythe and cut these hounds into pieces as
they approached.</p>
        <p>Others had “remedies” that they used that
the hounds could not scent them, so they
could not be trailed; for they could be within
five feet of the hounds and they could not
scent them.</p>
        <p>I knew a woman who could not be conquered
by her mistress, and so her master
threatened to sell her to New Orleans Negro
traders. She took her right hand, laid it
down on a meat block and cut off three fingers,
and thus made the sale impossible; but
I will not recount these cruelties further.</p>
        <p>After living at Elberton Court House two
<pb id="heard28" n="28"/>
years, my mother became the mother of her
last child, George Clark.</p>
        <p>Typhoid fever broke out as an epidemic.
My oldest sister and my mother died in this
epidemic. Myself, Beverly, Cordelia and
George Clark were left orphans. I was nine
years of age, the oldest of the four. George
Clark, the youngest, was five weeks old.
This was about the year 1859.</p>
        <p>When I became ten years of age I began
working on the farm. A plow was made
just to suit my height, and I plowed day
after day. So went on until 1865.</p>
        <p>One day in 1865 I was plowing with a
mare called “Old Jane,” and I looked and
saw the “Yankees.” I had heard before of
their coming. I took out Old Jane and went
to the house about three o'clock in the afternoon.
I was asked why I had come home
at that hour. I told them “I was afraid the
Yankees would steal my horse, so I brought
her home,” but that was not the cause at all.
Freedom had come, and I came to meet it.</p>
        <pb id="heard29" n="29"/>
        <p>Four weeks after that I was stacking hay
one day, and the “boss man” came out where
we were at work. He was under the influence
of drink and he beat everybody. That
night I took all my belongings, put them in
a pocket handkerchief and “went to freedom.”
Thus ended slavery with me.</p>

        <head>MY EDUCATION</head>
        <p>I attended Sunday School when I was ten
years of age, in Elberton, Georgia, at the
Methodist Episcopal Church South. We did
not learn to read nor to write, as it was
against the law for any person to teach any
slave to read; and any slave caught writing
suffered the penalty of having his forefinger
cut from his right hand; yet there were some
who could read and write.</p>
        <p>In this Sunday School we were taught the
Bible and Catechism, and committed much
to memory by having the same repeated to
us in the Sunday School, and then some
member of the white family carried this out
during the week; so that there were those
of us who could repeat whole Psalms and
<pb id="heard32" n="32"/>
chapter after chapter in the Shorter
Catechism.</p>
        <p>This was the education that came to a
slave, and I for one had five years of this
kind of training.</p>
        <p>At the end of five years freedom came;
but there were no teachers in the part of
the county in which I lived and no schools
for Negroes.</p>
        <p>My father was a wheelwright and had a
shop on the main road, not far from the town
school, so I secured the services of a “Poor
white” boy named Billee Adams and
paid him ten cents a lesson and studied in
Webster's Blue Back Spelling Book. I
studied spelling, reading, and arithmetic all
in this one book.</p>
        <p>After six months the year 1865 ended and
I was hired to a farmer by the name of William
Henry Heard, from whom I received
my name. The contract was five dollars per
month and a recitation each night. I worked
<pb id="heard33" n="33"/>
from “kin to cant,” that is: from daylight
to dark. When I came in, put up my
mule, and fed him, I made my way to the
dining room and waited for my teacher to
finish his supper, then I recited my lesson
to him. I had added another study, writing,
to my curriculum, and my hour for study
was twelve o'clock in the day. We were
given one hour for dinner and feeding our
stock. Many of the hands slept this hour.
I spent it in the preparation of my lessons
for the night.</p>
        <p>Boys had no pockets in their clothes in
those days, so I cut the board back from
my book and carried it on my head, under
my cap. It was safe unless a hard rain came
up, then cap, book, and all suffered.</p>
        <p>After we laid by the crops in June, I went
to Elberton Court House and attended
school six weeks under a young man named
George H. Washington, from Augusta,
Georgia. I studied spelling, reading,
<pb id="heard34" n="34"/>
writing, arithmetic, and geography. At the end
of this time I could spell words of five or
six syllables, compose, and write a letter and
understood the four rules of arithmetic: addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division.
This was only a Summer school,
and we all returned to the farm at the end
of six weeks.</p>
        <p>I kept up my studies with a farmer until
Christmas. At Christmas I was hired to
another farmer by the name of Clay Hulmes.
He had attended the High School and was
prepared to give me a great deal of help,
but he was a “poor boy” and much prejudiced,
but our contract was six dollars per
month, board, and a lesson at night.</p>
        <p>While I had three or four studies he would
only have me recite one study each night.
After six months I left him. I had broken
the contract and my father felt bound to
make me carry it out, so he sent me back.
I stayed three days and broke it again, so
<pb id="heard35" n="35"/>
they all decided that it was best that we
stay apart.</p>
        <p>By this time we had a regular school in
the town taught by a lady by the name of Mrs.
Hankinson. I worked at my father's
shop morning and evening, and attended
this school for six weeks, which so prepared
me that in the Fall I began teaching school
myself, and with a private teacher I carried
forward my studies and was able to stand
an examination and teach the three months
public school, which was a great help to me
financially, for we were allowed one dollar
per month per scholar, and with an assistant
I had one hundred or more pupils, so that
I had at the close of this school term over
three hundred dollars in money, and that
was big money in those days, and it gave
me a start in the world of economics. During
this teaching I took lessons from a white
man by the name of James Lofton. I
studied grammar, mathematics, and history.
When I learned the parts of speech in
Smith's Grammar and their relation to each
<pb id="heard36" n="36"/>
other, it was a revelation to me. I saw opening
up along the intellectual horizon things
I never dreamed of. I was a man of good
memory, they said, and I got much from
my studies, so that I went on teaching and
in the second year I received a second grade
certificate, taught the Public School and was
rewarded as before.</p>
        <p>In January, 1873, I went to Mt. Carmel,
South Carolina, where I had a six months
public school and a regular salary of forty
dollars per month. I taught here four years
and continued my studies under the township
school teacher of the white school, a
Mrs. Ritchie, who taught me algebra and
Latin.</p>
        <p>The State of South Carolina at that time
was Republican and the University of South
Carolina at that time was under State control,
as it is now. There were scholarships
in each county, and any boy over sixteen
years of age and under twenty-one years
could compete for these scholarships.
<pb id="heard37" n="37"/>
Abbeyville County, in which I lived, was entitled
to five. I won one of these scholarships,
entered the University and received
twenty dollars per month. With that I supported
my family and myself. I entered as
a freshman, but in 1877, when the Democrats
came in power, they turned out all the
Colored students. I was a sophomore in the
classical department at the time.</p>
        <p>Being a member of the Legislature from
Abbeyville County, I was unseated by the
Democrats and refused a school in the
county because of my interest in politics.</p>
        <p>I returned to Georgia and opened a
school in the African Methodist Episcopal
Church at Athens. At the end of the summer
School, for that was all that we had,
I entered Clarke University, spent one term
there and then was persuaded to enter Atlanta
University. I spent one year as a
Junior in the classical department. At the
end of this year I had a governmental position
and so I left school until I came to
Philadelphia in August, 1888. I then entered
<pb id="heard38" n="38"/>
the Reformed Episcopal Seminary at
Forty-first and Chestnut Streets, Philadelphia,
studied Theology, Hebrew, and Greek,
and took the Extension Course of Lectures
at the University of Pennsylvania. Thus
ended the patchwork of such an education
as I have been able to pick up.</p>
        <p>I have <sic corr="an"/> Honorary Degree of Doctor of
Divinity (D. D.) from Allen University, also
from Wilberfore University, <sic corr="a"/> Doctor of <sic corr="Law">Laws</sic>
(LL. D.) from Campbell College, Jackson,
Mississippi. These titles are honorary;
given to me because of the position I occupy
in the Church more than from learning.</p>

        </head>
        <head>IN POLITICS</head>
        <p>At the close of the war I was but fifteen
years of age, and yet I had much to do with
the politics of the county in which I lived
(Elbert County).</p>
        <p>Colonel James T. Ackerman, who was the
United States Attorney General under President
Ulysses S. Grant, and who lived in
that county, was a staunch Republican and
encouraged me much along this line. In
1872 I had just reached my majority and
was the County Chairman of the Republican
Party, and looked after the interests of
that party together with a man by the name
of Nathan Thompson, who could neither
read nor write. Our tickets for the election
of 1872 were printed, and distributed by the
State Chairman. While our Postmaster was
<pb id="heard40" n="40"/>
a Republican, yet by some Democratic move
our tickets were intercepted and were not
allowed to reach us. We had no railroad and
got mail only every other day, so that when
the mail came in on Monday, or the day
before the election, no tickets came in it.
So in order to have tickets the next day at
the polls, I wrote tickets all night, and five
hundred tickets were cast at that precinct.
Had we received our tickets and distributed
them at each precinct the county would
have gone Republican, but as it was we lost
the county.</p>
        <p>I was a candidate for the Legislature on
the Republican ticket. Grant and Colfax
were the candidates for President and 
Vice-President.</p>
        <p>In 1876 I was in South <sic corr="Carolina">Carlina</sic>. It was
called “THE RED-SHIRT CAMPAIGN,”
and will never be forgotten for its bloody
deeds. Yet the Republicans stood their
ground and won out in many counties. I
was a candidate for the Legislature on the
<pb id="heard41" n="41"/>
Republican ticket, from Abbeyville County.
We carried the county by over one thousand
majority. I carried my precinct, Calhoun
Mills, by three hundred and fifteen.</p>
        <p>On the night before the election we gathered
all the Republican voters together in
a school-house near the precinct, sang and
prayed, drank coffee and ate sandwiches all
night.</p>
        <p>Just at daylight we marched to the polls
and stood in line until we had voted five
hundred Republican votes. I was Deputy
United States Marshal and had the conflict
of my life, but we were three to one. Every
man armed with some kind of weapon and
each stood by his post. We counted our
votes and left the polls about three o'clock
in the morning when the Democrats undertook
to capture our returns; but we were
too strong for them; however, they did capture
them after we had left.</p>
        <p>On Saturday I returned to the precinct
to get affidavits from the managers of the
<pb id="heard42" n="42"/>
election. I was captured by the Democrats,
my hands tied behind me, and carried into
Elbert County, where they made a fire in
an old school-house. We remained there all
night. I was tied to two of these men, so
if they fell asleep I could not get away.</p>
        <p>The next morning I was carried to Ruckersville,
where they all drank whisky. The
South Carolina mob tried to get these
Georgians to do away with me; but they did
not have the courage, or they were too proud
of me as a Georgian to do so.</p>
        <p>At the fall of night they carried me to
Ed Starke's, with whom I had had trouble
on election day in 1872, and tried to get
him to do their deed, but his father said:
“There can be no killing on my place.” So
after supper, about eight o'clock at night,
they took me down to Broad River, had a
Colored man to put me across and released
me.</p>
        <p>I was thirty miles from the railroad, in
Wilkes County, but, I knew my territory so
<pb id="heard43" n="43"/>
that I walked that thirty miles and was
at Washington-Wilkes the next morning at
daylight.</p>
        <p>I hid around until the train blew, then
I went aboard and lay down as a sick man.
When the conductor came around for tickets
I played off that I was too sick to have
bought a ticket. I had five dollars in my
pockets and I paid my way to Augusta,
Georgia, went across the river to Hamburg,
South Carolina, and stated to the captain of
the troops stationed there who I was and
what position I held. He sent me to Columbia,
where I made an affidavit of the vote
of my precinct, which gave the State to
Hayes and Wheeler, as we had a Republican
majority of three hundred and fifteen. I
took my seat as a member of the Legislature
from Abbeyville County, and sat during that
session; but at the end of the session the
<pb id="heard44" n="44"/>
Democrats contested our seats and unseated
us. The troops were removed and the State
turned over to the Democrats.</p>
        <p>In 1880 I was appointed railway postal
clerk by the direction of Congressman
Emory Speare, an independent Democrat,
for whom I had canvassed, and whose election
I had helped to secure. I (in my route)
ran from Lula to Athens, Georgia, from Atlanta
to Macon, Georgia, and from Atlanta,
Georgia, to Charlotte, North Carolina, for
two years. I resigned this position to enter
the ministry. After this I took no great interest
in politics until February, 1895, when
by the assistance of Bishop Henry McNeil
Turner, I was appointed by President Grover
Cleveland United States Minister Resident
and Consul General to Liberia, West Coast
Africa, which position I held for four years.</p>
        <p>At the same time I preached regularly and
built the church at Monrovia, Liberia, from
<pb id="heard45" n="45"/>
the funds received from the government, and
not from the Church.</p>
        <p>The Eliza Turner Memorial Chapel stands
there today as a crowning effort and a token
of my interest in the Church.</p>

        </head>
        <head>TRAVEL</head>
        <p>Travel with me became a great charm and
fact. I had not left the State in which I
was born until I was twenty-three years of
age. I then went to South Carolina, where
I taught school, and remained within the
bounds of this State for four years.</p>
        <p>After that I returned to Georgia and
taught school four years more without leaving
the State; but in 1883 I was appointed
to Aiken, South Carolina, and remained
there two years.</p>
        <p>At the end of two years I went to Charleston,
South Carolina, and after the earthquake
in 1886, the damage done to my
church compelled me to go North. I visited
Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York and
Boston. This opened up a new world to me.
<pb id="heard48" n="48"/>
During that summer I went to Wilberforce,
Ohio, and saw my Church and Race as I
had not seen it before.</p>
        <p>In 1888 I came to Philadelphia to live
and have remained here up to the present
day, yet I served Wilmington, Delaware,
and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. I was appointed
from Harrisburg United States Minister
to Liberia, February, 1895.</p>
        <p>This gave me an opportunity to cross the
ocean. I had dreaded all my life this great
body of water, and I entered upon its bosom
with much timidity. I took the “Norramandie”
steamship for Southampton in
March, 1895, and arrived at Southampton
at midnight, eight days after, took the train
to London, arriving there at two o'clock in
the morning, and drove to the Hotel Finsbury,
on Finsbury Pavement. I was soon
directed to my room, where I spent a few
hours.</p>
        <pb id="heard49" n="49"/>
        <p>Arising early I visited London with a
guide. I went to St. Paul's Cathedral, the
greatest Church in the world. I also visited
Westminster Abbey and looked upon the
graves of poets, statesmen and crowned
heads; here the Wesleys, Livingstone and
Stanley are deposited.</p>
        <p>I visited the Parliament, the great Congress
House of England, and the British
Museum, which, perhaps, has no equal for
antiquity in the world. The Pharoahs and
Rameses are here to be seen, and no one
can mistake them for Caucasian; they are
African. These mummies are the exact likenesses
of those old kings and show that they
belong to the Hamitic race.</p>
        <p>The oldest copies of the “Book of Books”
(The Bible) are to be seen here. This
Museum requires more than a week's survey
in order to be able to tell what is there.
I did not stay that long at this time, but I
had a week, and more than a week, at another
<pb id="heard50" n="50"/>
time. Any traveler going East seeking
information will find it here.</p>
        <p>I visited the “Crystal Palace,” a building
of pure crystal, covering an acre of land; I
have never seen its equal. The exhibition
that is shown here, day after day, and year
after year, is not only informing, but
thrilling.</p>
        <p>Finding that Bishop H. M. Turner was
in Liverpool on his way to Africa, I cut my
stay short and joined him at Liverpool.</p>
        <p>An incident occurred to me as I was leaving
London that will occur to any stranger,
that is: when I went to settle my bill
asked the clerk how much it was. While I
knew shillings and pounds, her expression
confused me. I said, “What is my bill?”
She said: “Eleven and six.” I did not know
what eleven and six was, so I gave her two
sovereigns, and asked her-if she could get
it out of them. She informed me that she
could get it out of one of them. I learned
<pb id="heard51" n="51"/>
afterwards that the bill was eleven and one-half
shillings, and that there are twenty
shillings in a pound or sovereign. I had
eight and one-half shillings change from
the sovereign. But I was yet confused, for
I had had a draft cashed that morning and
part of it was in gold and part in paper.</p>
        <p>The English five-pound notes look like
tissue paper. I paid no attention to the
notes at all, and mistook them to be paper
to wrap my gold coin in. But finding that
I was seventy-five dollars short, I looked on
this “tissue paper” and found that it had
printing on it, so I took it to the cashier
and asked her if it would explain anything
concerning the fifteen pounds I was short.
She informed me that each of these three
pieces of tissue paper was a five-pound note,
making fifteen pounds in all, the amount of
my supposed fifteen pounds shortage. I rejoiced
at my discovery and went away a
wiser man.</p>
        <p>I reached Liverpool early in the morning
and sought a restaurant for my breakfast.
<pb id="heard52" n="52"/>
But restaurants in the East do not open
until ten o'clock in the morning, and, therefore,
do not serve breakfast, so I sought the
railroad people and was able to get breakfast.
I then went to the landing and found
Bishop Turner ready to sail on the
“Calabar.”</p>
        <p>At ten o'clock we weighed anchor and
started for the west coast of Africa. But
learning that a storm was raging outside of
the bar we anchored and remained all night.
Sunday morning we continued our journey.</p>
        <p>After six days we were in the Bay of
Biscay, called the “Ocean Graveyard.” It
was very rough and Bishop Turner was very
much afraid. The boat was a cargo boat
and the front was very low, so we shipped
thousands of tons of water.</p>
        <p>Bishop Turner became very much excited
and said: “Heard this ship is liable to sink
at any minute.” He went on the bridge and
asked the captain. The captain told him
yes, it was liable to sink at any minute. He
<pb id="heard53" n="53"/>
came back and informed me of the condition.
I went to my room and went to bed. He
remained on deck tramping water knee deep
part of the time.</p>
        <p>A school of flying fish flew into our boat
and the seamen said: “This is a bad omen.”
That did not help us any, but increased our
excitement. About ten o'clock at night the
storm seemed to have reached its height.
Bishop Turner came to my room and said:
“Heard, how can you lie down here and
sleep. It looks like the boat will go down
any minute.” I told him I could not help
the case, therefore I had gotten where I
could not see what was going on.</p>
        <p>Next morning the storm had subsided.
We had about crossed the Bay and were
nearing the Canary Islands.</p>
        <p>Sunday morning at sunrise we were all on
deck sighting the Canary Islands. At ten
o'clock in the morning we were anchored off
Las Palmas, the principal city of Grand Canary
<pb id="heard54" n="54"/>
Island. We went ashore and attended
services at the Church of England, where
we heard a sermon preached in English. It
was an Easter sermon, as this was Easter
Sunday.</p>
        <p>After the sermon we went to the hotel
and had our dinner. Very little English
was spoken anywhere on the island, but we
had gotten along well up to this time, because
we had a guide. After dinner Bishop
Turner said: “I will go back on the boat
and spend the night.” I told him I would
remain off all night. But after he was
gone and the guide had left me all the English
was gone.</p>
        <p>I found it impossible to make myself understood,
so I could not remain all night. I
went out, got a taxi and returned to the boat,
where I remained all night.</p>
        <p>The next day was Easter Monday, a holiday,
so that everything was quiet, the ship
getting supplies as best she could. In the
<pb id="heard55" n="55"/>
afternoon we sailed for Sierra Leone, and
reached there the following Sunday.</p>
        <p>As we reached this African town of forty
thousand inhabitants and less than one-fourth
of them civilized, we felt good, for
here we met our people. Up to this time we
had been with the other race, which was not
very customary to us.</p>
        <p>We “American Daddies” were welcomed
by the natives. They followed us by the
hundreds and rejoiced at our coming.</p>
        <p>The Annual Conference met immediately
with five or six native preachers and three
Americans. It was a great conference, and
much interest was manifested in our coming,
and in our work.</p>
        <p>The Governor of the Colony, Colonel Cardew,
gave a dinner, and invited the Bishop,
the United States Minister and Presiding
Elders, Steady and Frederick. This showed
appreciation of the work we were trying to
<pb id="heard56" n="56"/>
do in the Colony.</p>
        <p>After a few days we were on our way to
Liberia, two hundred and forty miles south,
and landed in twenty-six hours. As we
touched the soil of this little Republic, a
thrill of joy and gratitude went through us.
There the American emigrant met us in
large numbers.</p>
        <p>We had no African Methodist Episcopal
Church, so we held the Conference in the
Methodist Episcopal Church through the
courtesy of the pastor.</p>
        <p>Being the United States Minister and
reaching there officially, I so informed the
Government that I had come to reside as
Minister Resident and Consul General of
the United States, and had my letter of credence,
which I desired to present. I was
informed that Thursday at twelve o'clock,
noon, would be fixed as the day and hour
for my reception and its reception.</p>
        <pb id="heard57" n="57"/>
        <p>On that day and at that hour, Bishop
Turner and myself were at the Executive
Mansion. There we met the President and
Cabinet, who received us.</p>
        <p>The Government is modeled after our (the
U. S.) Government. The President, Hon.
J. J. Cheeseman, of Georgia, an emigrant
from that State; Vice President, Hon. J. J.
Ross, an emigrant from Georgia; Secretary
of State, Hon. G. W. Gibson, an emigrant
from Baltimore, Maryland; Secretary of the
Treasury, Hon. Arthur Barclay, a West Indian;
Attorney General, Hon. F. E. R. Johnson,
a Liberian; Secretary of Education,
Hon. S. J. Dennis, a Liberian; Secretary of
the Interior, Hon. J. H. Moore, an emigrant
from South Carolina; Secretary of War and
Navy, Hon. A. D. Williams, an emigrant
from Virginia. These men made up the Cabinet
of this Republic. It is not a wonder
that they have done so little; but it is a
<pb id="heard58" n="58"/>
wonder that they have done so much.</p>
        <p>We delivered our Letter of Credence, made
our address of friendship, followed by Bishop
Turner, and was responded to by the <sic corr="President">Presdent</sic>
himself and the Secretary of State,
after which a banquet was served in real
American style for all the representatives of
the different governments, who drank toast,
to the Liberian and American Governments. </p>
        <p>In 1896 we returned to America and visited
the General Conference at Wilmington,
North Carolina, being a delegate from the
Liberia Conference.</p>
        <p>After sixty days leave, we returned to Liberia
in company of Mrs. Heard as far as
England, and made our first visit to France.</p>
        <p>This country is the highest in its recognition
of man without regard to color of any
I have ever visited. The art of painting,
drawing and sculpture gives every visitor an
opportunity to learn and be inspired as he
<pb id="heard59" n="59"/>
visits “The Louvre.” The hotels are first-class,
and every person gets first-class accommodation
if he can pay for it.</p>
        <p>From Paris we went to Genoa, Florence,
Milan, Bologne, Venice and Geneva. It is
not our purpose in this little book to describe
these cities, but one visiting them will
come home wiser and better from what he
sees, and the contact with these people. We
also visited the World's Sunday School Convention
at Zurich, Switzerland, and found
these people devoid of prejudice. Prejudice
across the Channel among the Latin races
is not so apparent as on this side <sic corr="of"/> the Channel
among the English-speaking people.
America puts her virus into these people
from New York weekly, and they seem to be
easily inoculated, so that in certain parts of
London and Liverpool the prejudice is as
great as in New York.</p>
        <p>My American travel was while I was serving
four years, without salary, and without
traveling expenses as Secretary-treasurer of
<pb id="heard60" n="60"/>
the Connectional Preachers' Aid and Mutual
Relief Association. I traveled in every State
in the Union, except Maine, New Hampshire,
Vermont and North Dakota. I attended
every Annual Conference in the A. M. E.
Church. Yearly I spent four months
on the road, two and three nights in a week
curled up on a bench in a “jim crow” car.
I never used a pass, but paid for every trip
during these four years without any funds
from the Church treasury.</p>
        <p>This travel has been the greatest school
to me, and a school in which any person may
invest; for in the United States and in the
different States you will get lessons that you
do not get at your home or in some other
State.</p>
        <p>In the countries abroad a man obtains
from contact what he can never obtain from
books. My travel in Africa gave me knowledge
that I would not exchange for that I
<pb id="heard61" n="61"/>
have obtained from the books I have read
concerning that country.</p>
        <p>My contact with the people of England,
France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland also
gave me knowledge of those countries and of
those people that made me know them better
than I could have known them by reading
history.</p>
        <p>My advice to young people is to travel.
If you have little, sacrifice and travel to the
extent of what you have, and travel with
your eyes and your mind open. If you have
much, go abroad and take time and spend a
month in Paris, a month in Germany, a
month in Rome, and a month in London, as
I have done. It will pay if you expect a
future.</p>

        </head>
        <head>MY CONVERSION</head>
        <p>The word “Conversion” is used interchangeably
with “Regeneration.” Many of
us use this word without thinking of the
depth to which the meaning takes us.</p>
        <p>I was nine years at the altar, every year
seeking CONVERSION. I had been told by
many ministers during these nine years that
all I had to do was to believe on the Lord.
This word, BELIEVE, to me meant only to
accredit things; but when I sought the Lord
I accredited Him as the Omnipotent, Omnipresent,
and Omniscient God; but I could
not conceive that He was MY FATHER,
and, therefore, the relationship of a father
was to be had by FAITH. So I had sought
the Lord all these years without faith in
Him as a Father, and myself as His child.
<pb id="heard64" n="64"/>
But year after year I became more and more
confident that He loved me, that He gave
His Son to die for me, and that the NEW
BIRTH fully established this relation, and
that when I could reach that New Birth by
faith in Christ as The Redeemer of the
world, and of man in particular, that my relation
as Son was not only established, but
rejoiced in; so that at a protracted meeting
in Athens, Georgia, April and May, 1879,
I attended the meeting and was at the altar
every night for five weeks.</p>
        <p>One night before the services began, I
reached the conclusion that open confession
of my sins and acknowledgement of Christ
as My Saviour was the thing to do. But I
lacked Faith to do this, because I had felt
nothing to assure me that I was saved. So
I carried out the idea by getting up in
seat and undertaking to make this confession
and acknowledgement.</p>
        <p>After some time standing on my feet, being
unable to speak, FAITH CAME, my
<pb id="heard65" n="65"/>
mouth flew open and I shouted for joy, and
then I openly acknowledged that I was a
sinner and that Christ was my Saviour, and
that I was willing and ready to surrender
ALL to Him.</p>
        <p>When I did this the burden of guilt left
me, and I felt that I was forgiven and the
only thing I had to do was to live in fellowship
with Him. And this I have tried to do
all these years. Therefore I believe that I
have turned my face in the right direction,
and am walking in the direction prescribed
in the Scriptures. And, so long as I walk
therein, I am converted, or regenerated, a
Son of God, a Brother of Christ, and an
Heir of Heaven.</p>

        <head>THE MINISTRY</head>
        <div2 type="subchapter">
          <head>Exhorter.</head>
          <p>On May 16, 1879, I was converted. At
that time I was teaching school and living
with Colonel W. A. Pledger, at Athens,
Georgia. He was a lawyer and I felt that
to be my calling; so I had been reading
Blackstone in preparation to be admitted to
the bar, and to make law my profession. But,
after my conversion, I felt the call to the
ministry, and was so impressed that when
the Quarterly Conference met in June, 1879,
I applied for license to exhort, as that is
the first step for a preacher in the Methodist
Church.</p>
          <pb id="heard68" n="68"/>
          <p>The Rev. Peter McClain was the Presiding Elder.
He was a man without literary
training, yet he could read, write and preach
a good gospel sermon. I had gone before my
class and they had sent me to the Quarterly
Conference. I was prepared educationally
to stand the examination, but in those days
many questions were asked to find out if
the applicant had gifts, graces, and really
had been called to the ministry.</p>
          <p>I exhorted for three months. I did not
preach, but exhorted; for an exhorter was
not permitted to take a text, but he read a
chapter, or part of a chapter and proceeded
to explain the same as he understood it.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="subchapter">
          <head>Local Preacher</head>
          <p>At the end of three months I had gone
before the Church, preached a trial sermon,
and they had recommended me to be licensed
as a local preacher.</p>
          <p>My trial sermon lasted about six minutes.
<pb id="heard69" n="69"/>
I had said all I knew, and I sat down. I
have kept that up these forty years, that
when I get through to sit down.</p>
          <p>While I only spoke six minutes, the
Church was impressed that I had been called
to the ministry, so after an examination by
the Quarterly Conference it recommended
me for local preacher's license. I taught
Sunday School, led a class, and preached
whenever called upon for three months.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="subchapter">
          <head>Traveling Licentiate</head>
          <p>At the end of these three months the
Quarterly Conference recommended me, and
I made application to join the Annual Conference.
I joined the North Georgia Annual
Conference at Macon, Georgia, under Bishop
Jabez Pitt Campbell, January 12, 1880.</p>
          <p>I was examined for admission by the Revs.
Andrew Brown, Robert Anderson, W. P.
Graham, L. Thomas, J. W. Randolph and
E. P. Holmes, and on the 12th day of January
<pb id="heard70" n="70"/>
the committee reported, and I, with
Revs. P. B. Peters, A. L. Shaw, William Upshur,
L. G. Gary, Jordan R. Gay and others
were admitted to the North Georgia Annual
Conference.</p>
          <p>At that time there were only two conferences
in the State of Georgia, and in February
(1880) Bishop Joseph Simeon Flipper
was admitted to the other conference (the
Georgia Annual Conference), so that in January,
1924, I shall have traveled in the itineracy
for forty-four years, and in February
Bishop Flipper shall have traveled the same
length of time.</p>
          <p>When the Conference adjourned and the
appointments were read, I was read out for
Johntown; no members, no church, only the
name of the place. But at the end of the
year I reported a church with eleven members,
and Conference Claims for every department.
The Church was paid for. I had
purchased a school house for a church</p>
          <p>I carried to the Annual Conference
<pb id="heard71" n="71"/>
twenty-five dollars for personal expenses. In
those days we were building schools, and
when the roll was called the Presiding Elders
and Pastors of large churches were asked
to pay five dollars, and all ministers one dollar.
But I paid my first five dollars on Morris
Brown College the year that I was admitted,
and have never paid less at any conference
I attended, and have never carried
less than twenty-five dollars for personal expenses
to an Annual Conference since 1880.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="subchapter">
          <head>Deacon</head>
          <p>In 1881 the Annual Conference met at
Atlanta, Georgia. I was examined in the
first year and second year studies and ordained
a Deacon by Bishop William Fisher
Dickerson. I had served my first year at
Johntown Mission, and at the adjournment
of this conference was returned for the second
year. In 1882, when the conference met,
I reported Johntown Mission with fifty-three
members, and it was a Circuit instead of a
Mission.</p>
        </div2>
        <pb id="heard72" n="72"/>
        <div2 type="subchapter">
          <head>Elder</head>
          <p>When the appointments were read, I was
read out for Markham Street Mission, Atlanta,
Georgia. I only served this point a
few months and was transferred to Aiken,
South Carolina. But before being transferred,
I passed the Fourth Year Class and
Bishop Dickerson ordained me an Elder at
Washington, Georgia. Bishop Wesley John
Gaines was chairman of the committee and
examined me.</p>
          <p>I served Aiken ten months, built a parsonage,
renovated the Church, took in one
hundred and sixty members at a revival, and
reported the church out of debt.</p>
          <p>Conference met this year at Georgetown,
South Carolina, and I was appointed to Marion,
South Carolina, but the Church at Aiken
telegraphed the Bishop not to send any one
else, so, in three days I was back to Aiken
for the second year. We had great success,
<pb id="heard73" n="73"/>
and at the conference held at Beaufort,
South Carolina, I was appointed to Mt. Zion
Church, Charleston, South Carolina.</p>
          <p>When I came to Aiken, it only paid three
hundred and fifty-five dollars a year, yet I
resigned a government position paying me
eleven hundred and fifty dollars a year. This
station paid me the first year six hundred
and fifty dollars; the second year, six hundred
and eighty dollars, two suits of clothes
each year and perquisites that amounted to
two or three hundred dollars. But coming
to Mt. Zion I had an appointment that
would pay me one thousand dollars, house
rent, fuel, and perquisites amounting to four
or five hundred dollars, which took me above
the salary I was receiving when I left the
railway mail service.</p>
          <p>This church was in debt to the amount of
ten thousand, three hundred and fifty dollars,
besides, they owed a current debt of
more than fifteen hundred dollars. But in
the course of six months I had met all the
<pb id="heard74" n="74"/>
obligations and had gotten down to the
bonded debt. I remained here three years,
and at no time could my regular congregation
be seated without bringing in chairs.
I paid the bonded debt down to five thousand dollars,
put in a pipe organ for two
thousand and five hundred dollars, and renovated
the church after the earthquake at a
cost of one thousand eight hundred dollars.
All of this was paid when I left by transfer
for the Philadelphia Annual Conference.
During these three years I received eleven
hundred persons in the church.</p>
          <p>Transferring from Bishop B. W. Arnett to
Bishop H. M. Turner, I was appointed to
Allen Chapel, Philadelphia, an appointment
Bishop Levi Jenkins Coppin had held until
he was elected editor of the A. M. E. Church
Review. We had one of the greatest revivals
that had taken place in the city of Philadelphia
for many years. This revival ran
<pb id="heard75" n="75"/>
for four weeks, and we took into our church
alone one hundred and thirty-one persons,
who I put into a class and led them with
the assistance of a lady named Martha Morris,
who proved to be a great leader, so that
when these persons were ready for full membership,
we lost not more than eight or ten
out of a class of one hundred and
thirty-one.</p>
          <p>This, perhaps, was the greatest number
ever received at any one time in Allen
Chapel. Allen Chapel since that time has
grown to be “Allen Church.” We only remained
there one year, and by our own
choice we were moved and became Presiding
Elder of the Lancaster District, and had a
most successful year. But Bishop Turner
removed us from this District and appointed
us, to the pastorate of “Mother Bethel
Church,” Philadelphia. At that time the
present structure was in course of erection,
<pb id="heard76" n="76"/>
and so for eight months we worshipped in
Horticultural Hall, on Broad Street, near
Spruce, where we preached Sabbath after
Sabbath, and paid one hundred dollars each
Sunday for rent.</p>
          <p>We stayed at Bethel two years, had two
great revivals and took in over six hundred
members. Many of the substantial members
that are in Bethel today came in during
this time. We finished this church at
a cost of fifty-five thousand dollars and
raised twenty-eight thousand during the two
years' service.</p>
          <p>No man stayed at Bethel, during these
times, but two years, and even though the
church was unanimous for our return, Bishop
B. T. Tanner removed us and sent us to
Bethel, Wilmington, Delaware. Here we remained
two years, had a great revival, assisted
by Doctor Benjamin F. Watson, and
took in the church, during this revival, two
hundred and eighty-four persons. Many of
these people are there today, and make some
<pb id="heard77" n="77"/>
of the leading members of that church. I
took in all, four hundred and sixty persons
into that church.</p>
          <p>After serving here two years, I was appointed
to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and
finished the new church on State Street, paid
the debts, kept up our monthly dues to the
Building and Loan Association, and had a
balance in bank to meet these dues; but the
minister who followed us used up the money
in bank and got behind six months in the
Building and Loan Association. To save
the church the Church Extension Society had
to come in and assist him.</p>
          <p>In February, 1895, I was appointed by
President Grover Cleveland, United States
Minister Resident and Consul General to
Liberia, West Coast Africa. But we would
not agree to take this appointment unless
we were permitted to transfer to the Liberia
Annual Conference and be given work. We
were transferred and made Superintendent
of the Liberia Annual Conference, which position
<pb id="heard78" n="78"/>
we held for four years. We took the
money out of our own pocket, purchased
the land, and built the first African Methodist
Episcopal Church in the city of Monrovia,
Liberia. This church stands now
as the ELIAS TURNER MEMORIAL
CHAPEL.</p>
          <p>Up to this time when we held conferences
in Monrovia, we had to borrow a church in
which to hold them, which was very inconvenient,
and we were humiliated more than
once by having to wait on a Sunday for a
convenient hour to ordain our men; and the
finances all went to the borrowed church.</p>
          <p>After four years I left Liberia and came
to America. I was appointed pastor of Zion
Mission, Philadelphia, where I remained one
year, renovated the church and paid for it.</p>
          <p>At the end of that year, against my will,
Bishop W. B. Derrick transferred me to the
New York Conference. I was made Presiding
Elder of the Long Island District, and
had a year of great success; but at the end
<pb id="heard79" n="79"/>
of that year I asked to be transferred to the
Philadelphia Annual Conference, and was
appointed to Phoenixville, Pennsylvania,
where I remained a few months; yet I never
enjoyed a pastorate more than I did the three
or four months at Phoenixville.</p>
          <p>In August, 1901, Rev. Doctor A. A. Whitman,
pastor at Allen Temple, Atlanta,
Georgia, died, so Bishop Turner appointed
me to Allen Temple by transfer. I served
these people for three years, increased their
membership, reduced their debts, and enjoyed
a pastorate such as I had not for
many years. This is a great church, and is
now growing to be the equal of any in
Georgia.</p>
          <p>After three years the quadrennium ended
and I had been elected to the General
Conference.</p>

        <pb id="heard81" n="81"/>
        <div2 type="subchapter">
          <head>GENERAL OFFICER</head>
          <p>At this General Conference (1904), I was
elected Secretary-Treasurer of the Connectional
Preachers' Aid and Mutual Relief Society.
Our predecessor had no money in
treasury, owed over four or five hundred
dollars debts, and the Society had only one
hundred and fifty members, none paid up.</p>
          <p>He received one thousand dollars salary.
We served four years without one cent of
salary, paid off all the debts, had one thousand
dollars in the treasury at the General
Conference. All of our debts were paid to
that date, and our membership had grown
to seven hundred.</p>
          <p>At the end of one quadrennium we were
elected Bishop and turned over this department
to Rev. W. A. Lewis, having traveled
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, the Lakes
to the Gulf without salary, selling books, delivering
lectures, and riding in “Jim Crow
Cars” for thousands of miles each year.</p>
          <pb id="heard82" n="82"/>
          <p>We came to Norfolk, Virginia, in 1908,
and our brethren crowned our efforts by
electing us one of the Bishops of the African
Methodist Episcopal Church, thus ending
our ministerial career of thirty-five years as
an itinerant as it relates to the pastorate.</p>

could for my defeat, but I was elected by a

West Africa.</p>
        <p>In January, 1909, with Mrs. Heard and
eight missionaries, I sailed for the West
Coast of Africa. We spent a few days in Liverpool
and London, England, and then
started for the West Coast. After eighteen
days' sailing we landed at Sierra Leone,
where I held my first conference. This was
indeed a great conference for a Mission field.</p>
        <p>We left Sierra Leone for Liberia. Here
we held our second conference, and our
missionaries were all put to work in this field.
This brought new life, and after four years'
hard work the two conferences were in fine
condition, meeting all the obligations incumbent
upon them.</p>
        <p>Had the war not come, and Bishop Ross
been permitted to succeed me, the work
would have been far in advance of what it
is today.</p>
        <pb id="heard85" n="85"/>
        <p>While I did my best, and all must give me
credit for having done great work from the
funds at my disposal, yet Bishop Brooks has
done the greatest work of any Bishop in our
Missionary Fields. It will go down to his
credit, and his name can never be erased
from the West Coast.</p>
        <p>After eight years' service we were called
home, and I was assigned to the Eighth
Episcopal District, comprising the States of
Mississippi and Louisiana. The conference
claims of this district, the minutes will show,
were not over fifty per cent., but when I reported
my fourth round of conferences, I reported
ninety per cent. of dollar money, the
greatest increase ever reported before, or
since. The amount today, 1923, is not equal
to what I reported in 1919-20. I did not
only financial work, but social and spiritual
work as well. The men of the district credit
me as a complete success.</p>
        <p>Leaving the Eighth District in 1920, we
were assigned to the First Episcopal District.
<pb id="heard86" n="86"/>
The First District reported for 1920,
twenty-one thousand, seven hundred and
eighty dollars and seventy-eight cents Dollar
money. We are reporting for this year thirty
thousand dollars, which shows our standard
financially in Dollar money. We have reported
for education this quadrennium more
than for four quadrenniums put together,
that is, the preceding four quadrenniums to
this added together will not amount to the
sum total to what we have raised this quadrennium
for education.</p>
        <p>We are winding up our four years with
a membership of more than seven thousand
above what we found at the beginning of the
quadrennium. The District, to show its appreciation
of the work done has just given
a reception ending with a great banquet, and
a purse of fifteen hundred dollars. This
speaks louder than mere words and every
conference of its own accord has unanimously
voted for the Bishop to be returned to the
district for another quadrennium.</p>
        <pb id="heard87" n="87"/>
        <p>From 1908 to 1924 in sixteen years and
over this period I have lived much, took
many souls into the church, and not shrank
from any duty that a Bishop is called upon
to fill. I go forth in the name of Him who
sent me, “knowing not what may befall me
and would not if I could.”</p>

        <head>MEN WHO INFLUENCED MY LIFE</head>
        <p>When I was a boy seventeen years of age,
the Rev. William J. White, a Baptist preacher
of Augusta, Georgia, came to Elberton,
my home, as an agent of the Freedmens Bureau,
and made a political speech. He was
the first colored man I had ever seen who
was well educated, and who could use the
King's English readily, accurately and convincingly.
He very much influenced me and
I determined from that night to be a MAN,
and to fill an important place in life's arena.</p>
        <p>It was just the dawn of political awakening
for the Negro. The Democrats that
night tarred his horse all over with pitch,
but the next morning he was up, had his
horse attended to, hitched him to his buggy
and went on his errand. I knew him for
<pb id="heard90" n="90"/>
many years afterwards. He edited a paper
called, “The Georgia Baptist.” He was always
outspoken for Orthodox Religion and
for the Republican Party.</p>
        <p>In January, 1867, I had an opportunity
to go to Augusta, Georgia, and there for the
first time I heard Bishop H. M. Turner
speak. He spoke on “The Negro in All
Ages.”</p>
        <p>He spoke for two hours. I was so impressed
with the pictures and historic facts
he presented of the Race in the past ages,
and of the men of the present, that my life
is largely what it is because of the impressions
made at this meeting.</p>
        <p>I returned to my home in Elberton, and
began my future work. The Rev. Aaron
Harris was presiding Elder of the C. M. E.
Church (Colored Methodist Episcopal
Church), at Elberton, and had me as secretary
of the Official Board and Quarterly
<pb id="heard91" n="91"/>
Conference in the C. M. E. Church before
I was a Christian.</p>
        <p>Bishop Vanderhorst, of that Church, came
to Elberton and preached. I was greatly
impressed by his sermon, and being secretary
of the Official Board and Quarterly Conference,
I determined to be a Christian, and
fill important places in the Church and in
social life.</p>
        <p>At Athens, Georgia, I taught in the A.
M. E. Church. The Rev. Richard Harper,
a medical graduate, was the pastor. He was
a good preacher and his sermons greatly influenced
me.</p>
        <p>After he was removed from Athens the
Rev. Lawrence Thomas took charge of the
Church. His sermons, lectures and life impressed
me to emulate and imitate, if possible,
his life.</p>
        <p>Bishop Gaines, also, though not so well
educated, influenced me to greater activity
in the ministry.</p>
        <pb id="heard92" n="92"/>
        <p>When I joined the Annual Conference,
Bishop Jabez Pitt Campbell was the Presiding
Bishop. He was a great gospel preacher
and I made him my ideal. Bishops Shorter,
Ward, and Dickerson influenced me more
than any men in the A. M. E. Church, except
Bishop Turner.</p>
        <p>These men were personally concerned in
my advancement, and helped me by word
and action, and I am greatly indebted to all
of them. They put in me determination,
courage and enthusiasm, and, I can say, had
I not been under the influence of the Bishops
named, perhaps I would not be what I am
today.</p>
        <p>Politically, Honorable Robert Brown Elliott
and Bishop Richard Harvey Cain, who
spoke so manfully on the “Civil Rights Bill,”
made me a greater advocate of the rights of
my people than I would have been. I was
also influenced by Congressman Robert
Smalls and the Honorable Thomas Miller, of
Beaufort, South Carolina.</p>
        <pb id="heard93" n="93"/>
        <p>Thus I became a staunch Republican by
the speeches delivered in Congress by these
men.</p>
        <p>The reply of Mr. Elliott to the Honorable
B. H. Hill, of Georgia, is a masterpiece. No
man can read it and not side with the argument
he produced in favor of the Negro.</p>
        <p>The Rev. J. C. Price, of the A. M. E. Zion
Church, lectured for me several times and
spent much time in my home. He was one
of the most eloquent and logical platform
orators of his day.</p>
        <p>The Honorable Frederick Douglass also
spoke in my church and lived in my home,
and he influenced my life for the uplift of
humanity, and for the advancement of the
Race.</p>
        <p>I cannot name all the men who helped me
in one way or another, but those mentioned
helped me most.</p>
        <p>I saw in the lives of Professor H. T. Kealing,
Professor John R. Hawkins, and Professor
<pb id="heard94" n="94"/>
A. S. Jackson, laymen who have done so
much for the Church on the platform that
they greatly encouraged me.</p>
        <p>The speeches and sermons of Bishop J. C.
Embry and Rev. William Decker Johnson,
of Georgia (not Bishop Johnson) who was
Secretary of Education, also helped me.</p>
        <p>And when I went to Liberia and met a
Negro President and Cabinet, I was so impressed
that the Negro had a future, that I
determined to spend my life in trying to
brighten that future.</p>
        <p>In 1882 I married my second wife, Miss
Josie D. Henderson, of Charlotte, North
Carolina. She is scholarly and poetic, and her
use of the English language, as well as the
criticism of my sermons, have done much in
making me the preacher they say I am.</p>
        <p>My present secretary, Rev. H. H. Cooper,
Director of the Drive, is a man who carefully
and correctly uses the language we
<pb id="heard95" n="95"/>
speak, and I have gotten, and get, impressions
and information from him.</p>
        <p>On New Year's Eve night, 1923, I heard
a sermon by Rev. W. S. Drummond, Presiding
Elder. The language could be criticised,
but the thought and delivery were
superb.</p>
        <p>I could continue this line of description,
but suffice it to say: I get lessons from any
and all who drop a word worth while.</p>

          <pb id="heard104" n="104"/>
          <l>For four years he gave his service,</l>
          <l>And no salary was paid.</l>
          <l>I must tell you in conclusion,</l>
          <l>Heard's accomplishments were great,</l>
          <l>And he was elected Bishop</l>
          <l>In the May of nineteen eight.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>For eight years of splendid service</l>
          <l>Upon Africa's West Coast,</l>
          <l>With untiring faith and courage</l>
          <l>Bishop Heard stood at his post.</l>
          <l>I would give you a brief outline</l>
          <l>Of his work for forty years,</l>
          <l>But there's too much territory,</l>
          <l>Too much service, too much tears.</l>
          <l>God has given us this great life</l>
          <l>Of true service on the earth,</l>
          <l>We have learned to love him dearly,</l>
          <l>We appreciate his worth.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>Bishop Heard has preached the Gospel</l>
          <l>Over sea and over land,</l>
          <l>He is now Presiding Bishop</l>
          <l>Where his great church first began.</l>
          <l>He resides in Philadelphia,</l>
          <l>Lives a peaceful, happy life,</l>
          <l>And attributes his great success</l>
          <l>To a useful, faithful wife.</l>
          <l>To God be Praise and Glory</l>
          <l>For this Man to preach His Word,</l>
          <l>For my race has found a leader,</l>
          <l>In this Bishop William Heard.</l>
