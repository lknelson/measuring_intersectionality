        <head>PREFACE</head>
        <head>TO THE ENGLISH EDITION.</head>
        <p>WHILE I feel conscious that most of the contents of
those Letters will be interesting chiefly to American
readers, yet I may indulge the hope that the fact of
their being the first production of a Fugitive Slave as
a history of travels may carry with them novelty
enough to secure for them, to some extent, the attention
of the reading public of Great Britain. Most of
the letters were written for the private perusal of a few
personal friends in America; some were contributed to
<hi rend="italics">Fredrick Douglass' Paper</hi>, a journal published in
the United States. In a printed circular sent some
weeks since to some of my friends, asking subscriptions
to this volume, I stated the reasons for its publication:
these need not be repeated here. To those who so
promptly and kindly responded to that appeal, I tender
my most sincere thanks. It is with no little diffidence
<pb id="browniv" n="iv"/>
that I lay these letters before the public; for I am not
blind to the fact that they must contain many errors;
and to those who shall find fault with them on that account,
it may not be too much for me to ask them kindly
to remember that the author was a slave in one of the Southern States of America, until he had attained the age of twenty years; and that the education he has acquired was by his own exertions, he never having had a day's schooling in his life.</p>

        <head>NOTE</head>
        <head>TO THE AMERICAN EDITION.</head>
        <p>During my sojourn abroad I found it advantageous to my
purse to publish a book of travels, which I did under the title of
“Three Years in Europe, or Places I have seen and People I have
met.” The work was reviewed by the ablest journals in Great
Britain, and from their favorable criticisms I have been induced
to offer it to the American public, with a dozen or more additional
chapters.</p>

        <p>WILLIAM WELLS BROWN, the subject of this narrative,
was born a slave in Lexington, Kentucky, not far
from the residence of the late Hon. Henry Clay. His
mother was the slave of Dr. John Young. His father
was a slaveholder, and, besides being a near relation of
his master, was connected with the Wickliffe family, one
of the oldest, wealthiest, and most aristocratic of the
Kentucky planters. Dr. Young was the owner of forty
or fifty slaves, whose chief employment was in cultivating
tobacco, hemp, corn, and flax. The doctor removed from
Lexington, when William was five or six years old, to the
State of Missouri, and commenced farming in a beautiful
and fertile valley, within a mile of the Missouri river.</p>
        <p>Here the slaves were put to work under a harsh and
cruel overseer, named Cook. A finer situation for a farm
could not have been selected in the state. With a climate
favorable to agriculture, and soil rich, the products came
<pb id="brown10" n="10"/>
in abundance. At an early age William was separated
from his mother, she being worked in the field and he as
a servant in his masters medical department. When
about ten years of age, the young slave's feelings were
much hurt at hearing the cries of his mother while being
flogged by the negro-driver for being a few minutes behind
the other hands in reaching the field. He heard her cry,
“O, pray! O, pray! O, pray!” These are the words
which slaves generally utter when imploring mercy at
the hands of their oppressors. The son heard it, though
he was some way off. He heard the crack of the whip,
and the groans of his poor mother. The cold chill ran
over him, and he wept aloud; but he was a slave like
his mother, and could render her no assistance, He was
taught by the most bitter experience, that nothing could
be more heart-rending than to see a dear and beloved
mother or sister tortured by unfeeling men, and to hear
her cries, and not to be able to render the least aid.
When William was twelve years of age, his master left
his farm and took up his residence near St. Louis. The
doctor having more hands than he wanted for his own
use, William was let out to a Mr. Freeland, an innkeeper.
Here the young slave found himself in the hands of a
most cruel and heartless master. Freeland was one of
the real chivalry of the South; besides being himself a
slaveholder, he was a horse-racer, cock-fighter, gambler,
and, to crown the whole, an inveterate drunkard, What
else but bad treatment could be expected from such a
character? After enduring the tyrannical and inhuman
usage of this man for five or six months, William resolved
to stand it no longer, and therefore ran away, like other
slaves who leave their masters, owing to severe treatment;
<pb id="brown11" n="11"/>
and not knowing where to flee, the young fugitive went into
the forest, a few miles from St. Louis. He had been in
the woods but a short time, when he heard the barking
and howling of dogs, and was soon satisfied that he was
pursued by the negro-dogs; and, aware of their ferocious
nature, the fugitive climbed a tree, to save himself from
being torn to pieces. The hounds were soon at the trunk
of the tree, and remained there, howling and barking,
until those in whose charge they were came up. The
slave was ordered down, tied, and taken home. Immediately
on his arrival there, he was, as he expected, tied up
in the smoke-house, and whipped till Freeland was satisfied,
and then smoked with tobacco-stems. This the
slaveholder called “<hi rend="italics">Virginia play.</hi>” After being well
whipped and smoked, he was again set to work. William
remained with this monster a few months longer, and was
then let out to Elijah P. Lovejoy, who years after became
the editor of an abolition newspaper, and was
murdered at Alton, Illinois, by a mob of slaveholders
from the adjoining State of Missouri. The system of
letting out slaves is one among the worst of the evils of
slavery. The man who hires a slave looks upon him in
the same light as does the man who hires a horse for a
limited period; he feels no interest in him, only to get
the worth of his money. Not so with the man who owns
the slave; he regards him as so much property, of which
care should be taken. After being let out to a steamer
as an under-steward, William was hired by James Walker,
a slave-trader. Here the subject of our memoir was
made superintendent of the gangs of slaves that were
taken to the New Orleans market. In this capacity,
William had opportunities, far greater than most slaves,
<pb id="brown12" n="12"/>
of acquiring knowledge of the different phases of the
“<hi rend="italics">peculiar institution.</hi>” Walker was a negro speculator,
who was amassing a fortune by trading in the bones,
blood and nerves, of God's children. The thought of
such a traffic causes us to exclaim with the poet,
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“——Is there not some chosen curse,</l><l>Some hidden thunder in the stores of heaven,</l><l>Red with uncommon wrath, to blast the man</l><l>Who gains his fortune from the blood of souls?”</l></lg></q>
Between fifty and sixty slaves were chained together,
put on board a steamboat bound for New Orleans, and
started on the voyage. New and strange scenes began
to inspire the young slave with the hope of escaping to a
land of freedom. There was in the boat a large room on
the lower deck in which the slaves were kept, men and
women promiscuously, all chained two and two together,
not even leaving the poor slaves the privilege of choosing
their partners. A strict watch was kept over them, so
that they had no chance of escape. Cases had occurred
in which slaves had got off their chains and made their
escape at the landing-places, while the boat stopped to
take in wood. But, with all their care, they lost one
woman who had been taken from her husband and children,
and, having no desire to live without them, in the
agony of her soul jumped overboard and drowned herself.
Her sorrows were greater than she could bear; slavery
and its cruel inflictions had broken her heart. She, like
William, sighed for freedom, but not the freedom which
even British soil confers and inspires, but freedom from
torturing pangs, and overwhelming grief.</p>
        <p>At the end of the week they arrived at New Orleans
the place of their destination. Here the slaves were
<pb id="brown13" n="13"/>
placed in a negro-pen, where those who wished to purchase
could call and examine them. The negro-pen is a
small yard surrounded by buildings, from fifteen to
twenty feet wide, with the exception of a large gate with
iron bars. The slaves are kept in the building during
the night, and turned into the pen during the day. After
the best of the gang were sold off, the balance was taken
to the Exchange Coffee-house auction rooms, and sold at
public auction. After the sale of the last slave, William
and Mr. Walker left New Orleans for St. Louis.</p>
        <p>After they had been at St. Louis a few weeks, another
cargo of human flesh was made up. There were amongst
the lot several old men and women, some of whom had
gray locks. On their way down to New Orleans William
had to prepare the old slaves for market. He was
ordered to shave off the old men's whiskers, and to pluck
out the gray hairs where they were not too numerous;
where they were, he colored them with a preparation of
blacking with a blacking-brush. After having gone
through the blacking process, they looked ten or fifteen
years younger. William, though not well skilled in the
use of scissors and razor, performed the office of the barber
tolerably. After the sale of this gang of negroes
they returned to St. Louis, and a second cargo was made
up. In this lot was a woman who had a child at the
breast, yet was compelled to travel through the interior
of the country on foot with the other slaves. In a
published memoir of his life, William says, “The child cried
during the most of the day, which displeased Mr. Walker,
and he told the mother that if her child did not stop crying
he would stop its mouth. After a long and weary
journey under a burning sun, we put up for the night
<pb id="brown14" n="14"/>
at a country inn. The following morning, just as they
were about to start, the child again commenced crying.
Walker stepped up to her, and told her to give the child
to him. The mother tremblingly obeyed. He took the
child by one arm, as any one would a cat by the leg,
and walked into the house where they had been staying,
and said to the lady, ‘Madam, I will make you a present
of this little nigger; it keeps making such a noise that I
can't bear it.’ ‘Thank you, sir,’ said the lady. The
mother, as soon as she saw that the child was to be left,
ran up to Mr. Walker, and, falling on her knees, begged
of him, in an agony of despair, to let her have her child.
She clung round his legs so closely that for some time
he could not kick her off; and she cried, ‘O my child,
my child! Master, do let me have my dear, dear child!
O! do, do! I will stop its crying, and love you forever,
if you will only let me have my child again.’ But her
prayers were not heeded; they passed on, and the mother
was separated from her child forever.</p>
        <p>“After the woman's child had been given away, Mr.
Walker rudely commanded her to retire into the ranks
with the other slaves. Women who had children were
not chained, but those who had none were. As soon as
her child was taken she was chained to the gang.”</p>
        <p>Nothing was more grievous to the sensitive feelings
of William than seeing the separation of families by the
slave-trader: husbands taken from their wives, and
mothers from their children, without the least appearance
of feeling on the part of those who separated them.
While at New Orleans, on one occasion, William saw a
slave murdered. The circumstances were as follows:
In the evening, between seven and eight o'clock, a slave
<pb id="brown15" n="15"/>
came running down the levee, followed by several men
and boys. The whites were crying out, “Stop that nigger!
stop that nigger!” while the poor panting slave,
in almost breathless accents, was repeating, “I did not
steal the meat—I did not steal the meat!” The poor
man at last took refuge in the river. The whites who
were in pursuit of him ran on board of one of the boats to
see if they could discover him. They finally espied him
under the bow of the steamboat “Trenton.” They got
a pike-pole, and tried to drive him from his hiding-place.
When they struck at him he would dive under the water.
The water was so cold that it soon became evident that
he must come out or be drowned.</p>
        <p>While they were trying to drive him from under the
boat or drown him, he, in broken and imploring accents,
said, “I did not steal the meat! I did not steal the meat!
My master lives up the river. I want to see my master.
I did not steal the meat! Do let me go home to Master!”
After punching and striking him over the head for some
time, he at last sunk in the water, to rise no more alive.</p>
        <p>On the end of the pike-pole with which they had been
striking him was a hook, which caught in his clothing,
and they hauled him up on the bow of the boat. Some
said he was dead; others said he was “playing 'possum;”
while others kicked him to make him get up; but
it was of no use—he was dead.</p>
        <p>As soon as they became satisfied of this, they commenced
leaving, one after another. One of the hands
on the boat informed the captain that they had killed the
man, and that the dead body was lying on the deck.
The captain, whose name was Hart, came on deck, and
said to those who were remaining, “You have killed this
<pb id="brown16" n="16"/>
nigger; now take him off my boat.” The dead body was
dragged on shore and left there. William went on board
of the boat where the gang of slaves were, and during
the whole night his mind was occupied with what he had
seen. Early in the morning he went on shore to see if
the dead body remained there. He found it in the
same position that it was left the night before. He
watched to see what they would do with it. It was left
there until between eight and nine o'clock, when a cart,
which took up the trash from the streets, came along,
and the body was thrown in, and in a few minutes more
was covered over with dirt, which they were removing
from the streets.</p>
        <p>At the expiration of the period of his hiring with
Walker, William returned to his master, rejoiced to have
escaped an employment as much against his own feelings
as it was repugnant to human nature. But this joy was
of short duration. The doctor wanted money, and
resolved to sell William's sister and two brothers. The
mother had been previously sold to a gentleman residing
in the city of St. Louis. William's master now informed
him that he intended to sell him, and, as he was his own
nephew, he gave him the privilege of finding some one to
purchase him, who would treat him better than if he
was sold on the auction-block. William tried to make
some arrangement by which he could purchase his own
freedom, but the old doctor would hear nothing of the
kind. If there is one thing more revolting in the trade
of human flesh than another, it is the selling of one's
own blood relations.</p>
        <p>He accordingly set out for the city in search of a new
master. When he arrived there, he proceeded to the
<pb id="brown17" n="17"/>
jail with the hope of seeing his sister, but was again
disappointed. On the following morning he made another
attempt, and was allowed to see her once, for the last
time. When he entered the room where she was seated
in one corner, alone and disconsolate, there were four
other women in the room, belonging to the same man,
who were bought, the jailer said, for the master's own
use.</p>
        <p>William's sister was seated with her face towards the
door when he entered, but her gaze was transfixed on
nothingness, and she did not look up when he walked up
to her; but as soon as she observed him she sprang up,
threw her arms around his neck, leaned her head upon
his breast, and, without uttering a word, in silent, indescribable
sorrow, burst into tears. She remained so for
some minutes, but when she recovered herself sufficiently
to speak she urged him to take his mother immediately,
and try to get to the land of freedom. She said there
was no hope for herself; she must live and die a slave.
After giving her some advice, and taking a ring from his
finger, he bade her farewell forever. Reader, did ever a
fair sister of thine go down to the grave prematurely?
If so, perchance thou hast drank deeply from the cup of
sorrow. But how infinitely better is it for a sister to
“go into the silent land” with her honor untarnished,
but with bright hopes, than for her to be sold to sensual
slaveholders!</p>
        <p>William had been in the city now two days, and, as
he was to be absent for only a week, it was well that he
should make the best use of his time, if he intended to
escape. In conversing with his mother, he found her
unwilling to make the attempt to reach the land of liberty
<pb id="brown18" n="18"/>
but she advised him by all means to get there
himself, if he possibly could. She said, as all her children
were in slavery, she did not wish to leave them;
but he loved his mother so intensely, that he could not
think of leaving without her. He consequently used all
his simple eloquence to induce her to fly with him, and, at
last, he prevailed. They consequently fixed upon the next
night as the time for their departure. The time at length
arrived, and they left the city just as the clock struck
nine. Having found a boat, they crossed the river in it.
Whose boat it was he did not know; neither did he care.
When it had served his purpose, he turned it adrift, and
when he saw it last it was going at a good speed down
the river. After walking in the main road as fast as
they could all night, when the morning came they made
for the woods, and remained there during the day; but
when night came again, they proceeded on their journey,
with nothing but the North Star to guide them. They
continued to travel by night, and to bury themselves in
the silent solitudes of the forest by day. Hunger and
fatigue could not stop them, for the prospect of freedom
at the end of the journey nerved them up. The very
thought of leaving slavery, with its democratic whips,
republican chains, and bloodhounds, caused the hearts of
the weary fugitives to leap with joy. After travelling ten
nights, and hiding in the woods during the day for fear of
being arrested and taken back, they thought they might
with safety go the rest of the way by daylight. In nearly
all the free states there are men who make a business of
catching runaway slaves and returning them to their
owners for the reward that may be offered; some of those
were on the alert for William and his mother, for they
<pb id="brown19" n="19"/>
had already seen the runaways advertised in the St. Louis
newspapers.</p>
        <p>All at once they heard the click of a horse's hoof, and
looking back saw three men on horseback galloping towards
them. They soon came up, and demanded them
to stop. The three men dismounted, arrested them on a
warrant, and showed them a handbill, offering two hundred
dollars for their apprehension and delivery to Dr.
Young and Isaac Mansfield, in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>While they were reading the handbill, William's mother
looked him in the face and burst into tears. “A cold
chill ran over me,” says he, “and such a sensation I
never experienced before, and I trust I never shall
again.” They took out a rope and tied him, and they
were taken back to the house of the individual who
appeared to be the leader. They then had something
given them to eat, and were separated. Each of them
was watched over by two men during the night. The
religious characteristic of the American slaveholder soon
manifested itself, as, before the family retired to rest,
they were all called together to attend prayers; and the
very man who, but a few hours before, had arrested poor,
panting, fugitive slaves, now read a chapter from the
Bible, and offered a prayer to God; as if that benignant
and omnipotent One consecrated the infernal act he had
just committed.</p>
        <p>The next morning they were chained and handcuffed,
and started back to St. Louis. A journey of three days
brought the fugitives again to the place they had left
twelve days previously, with the hope that they would
never return. They were put in prison to await the
orders of their owners. When a slave attempts to escape
<pb id="brown20" n="20"/>
and fails, he feels sure of either being severely punished,
or sold to the negro-traders and taken to the far south,
there to be worked up on a cotton, sugar, or rice plantation.
This William and his mother dreaded. While
they were in suspense as to what would be their fate,
news came to them that the mother had been sold to a
slave-speculator. William was soon sold to a merchant
residing in the city, and removed to his new owner's
dwelling. In a few days the gang of slaves, of which
William's mother was one, were taken on board a steamer,
to be carried to the New Orleans market. The young
slave obtained permission from his new owner to go and
take a last farewell of his mother. He went to the boat,
and found her there, chained to another woman, and the
whole number of slaves, amounting to some fifty or sixty,
chained in the same manner. As the son approached his
mother she moved not, neither did she weep; her emotions
were too deep for tears. William approached her,
threw his arms around her neck, kissed her, fell upon
his knees begging her forgiveness, for he thought he was
to blame for her sad condition, and if he had not persuaded
her to accompany him she might not have been
in chains then.</p>
        <p>She remained for some time apparently unimpressionable,
tearless, sighless, but in the innermost depths of her
heart moved mighty passions. William says, “She
finally raised her head, looked me in the face,—and such
a look none but an angel can give!—and said, ‘My dear
son, you are not to blame for my being here, You have
done nothing less than your duty. Do not, I
pray you, weep for me; I cannot last long upon a cotton
plantation. I feel that my heavenly Master will soon
<pb id="brown21" n="21"/>
call me home, and then I shall be out of the hands of
the slaveholders.’ I could hear no more, my heart
struggled to free itself from the human form. In a moment
she saw Mr. Mansfield, her master, coming toward
that part of the boat, and she whispered in my ear, ‘My
child, we must soon part to meet no more on this side
of the grave. You have ever said that you would not
die a slave; that you would be a freeman. Now try to
get your liberty! You will soon have no one to look
after but yourself!’ and just as she whispered the last
sentence into my ear, Mansfield came up to me, and,
with an oath, said, ‘Leave here this instant! you have
been the means of my losing one hundred dollars to get
this wench back,’ at the same time kicking me with a
heavy pair of boots. As I left her she gave one shriek,
saying, ‘God be with you!’ It was the last time that I
saw her, and the last word I heard her utter.</p>
        <p>“I walked on shore. The bell was tolling. The boat
was about to start. I stood with a heavy heart, waiting
to see her leave the wharf. As I thought of my mother,
I could but feel that I had lost
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>‘The glory of my life,</l><l>My blessing and my pride!</l><l>I half forgot the name of slave</l><l>When she was by my side.’</l></lg></q></p>
        <p>“The love of liberty that had been burning in my
bosom had well-nigh gone out. I felt as though I was
ready to die. The boat moved gently from the wharf,
and while she glided down the river I realized that my
mother was indeed
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>‘Gone—gone—sold and gone</l><l>To the rice-swamp, dank and lone.’</l></lg></q></p>
        <pb id="brown22" n="22"/>
        <p>“After the boat was out of sight I returned home;
but my thoughts were so absorbed in what I had witnessed
that I knew not what I was about. Night came,
but it brought no sleep to my eyes.” When once the
love of freedom is born in the slave's mind, it always
increases and brightens, and William heard so
much about Canada, where a number of his acquaintances
had found a refuge and a home, he heartily desired to
join them. Building castles in the air in the day-time,
incessantly thinking of freedom, he would dream of the
land of liberty, but on waking in the morning would weep
to find it but a dream.</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“He would dream of Victoria's domain,</l>
          <l>And in a moment he seemed to be there;</l>
          <l>But the fear of being taken again</l>
          <l>Soon hurried him back to despair.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Having been for some time employed as a servant in
a hotel, and being of a very active turn, William's new
owner resolved to let him out on board a steamboat.
Consequently the young slave was hired out to the
steamer St. Louis, and soon after sold to Captain Enoch
Price, the owner of that boat. Here he was destined to
remain but a short period, as Mrs. Price wanted a carriage-driver,
and had set her heart upon William for that purpose.</p>
        <p>Scarcely three months had elapsed from the time that
William became the property of Captain Price, ere that
gentleman's family took a pleasure-trip to New Orleans,
and William accompanied them. From New Orleans the
family proceeded to Louisville. The hope of escape
again dawned upon the slave's mind, and the trials of
<pb id="brown23" n="23"/>
the past were lost in hopes for the future. The love of
liberty, which had been burning in his bosom for years,
and which, at times, had been well-nigh extinguished,
was now resuscitated. Hopes nurtured in childhood, and
strengthened as manhood dawned, now spread their sails
to the gales of his imagination. At night, when all
around was peaceful, and in the mystic presence of the
everlasting starlight, he would walk the steamer's decks,
meditating on his happy prospects, and summoning up
gloomy reminiscences of the dear hearts he was leaving
behind him. When not thinking of the future his mind
would dwell on the past. The love of a dear mother, a
dear and affectionate sister, and three brothers yet living,
caused him to shed many tears. If he could only be
assured of their being dead, he would have been comparatively
happy; but he saw, in imagination, his mother
in the cotton-field, followed by a monster task-master,
and no one to speak a consoling word to her. He beheld
his sister in the hands of the slave-driver, compelled to
submit to his cruelty, or, what was unutterably worse,
his lust; but still he was far away from them, and could
not do anything for them if he remained in slavery;
consequently he resolved, and consecrated the resolve with
a prayer, that he would start on the first opportunity.</p>
        <p>That opportunity soon presented itself. When the
boat got to the wharf where it had to stay for some time,
at the first convenient moment William made towards the
woods, where he remained until night-time. He dared
not walk during the day, even in the State of Ohio, he
had seen so much of the perfidy of white men, and
resolved, if possible, not to get into their hands. After
darkness covered the world, he emerged from his hiding-place;
<pb id="brown24" n="24"/>
but he did not know east from west, or north from
south; clouds hid the North Star from his view. In
this desolate condition he remained for some hours, when
the clouds rolled away, and his friend, with its shining
face,—the North Star,—welcomed his sight. True as
the needle to the pole, he obeyed its attractive beauty, and
walked on till daylight dawned.</p>
        <p>It was winter-time; the day on which he started was
the first of January, and, as it might be expected, it was
intensely cold; he had no overcoat, no food, no friend,
save the North Star, and the God which made it. How
ardently must the love of freedom burn in the poor
slave's bosom, when he will pass through so many
difficulties, and even look death in the face, in winning his
birthright freedom! But what crushed the poor slave's
heart in his flight most was, not the want of food or
clothing, but the thought that every white man was his
deadly enemy. Even in the free States the prejudice
against color is so strong, that there appears to exist a
deadly antagonism between the white and colored races.</p>
        <p>William in his flight carried a tinder box with him,
and when he got very cold he would gather together dry
leaves and stubble and make a fire, or certainly he would
have perished. He was determined to enter into no
house, fearing that he might meet a betrayer.</p>
        <p>It must have been a picture which would have inspired
an artist, to see the fugitive roasting the ears of corn that
he found or took from barns during the night, at solitary
fires in the deep solitudes of woods.</p>
        <p>The suffering of the fugitive was greatly increased by
the cold, from the fact of his having just come from the
warm climate of New Orleans. Slaves seldom have more
<pb id="brown25" n="25"/>
than one name, and William was not an exception to this,
and the fugitive began to think for an additional name.
A heavy rain of three days, in which it froze as fast as it
fell, and by which the poor fugitive was completely
drenched, and still more chilled, added to the depression
of his spirits already created by his weary journey.
Nothing but the fire of hope burning within his breast
could have sustained him under such overwhelming trials.</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“Behind he left the whip and chains;</l>
          <l>Before him were sweet Freedom's plains.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Through cold and hunger, William was now ill, and
he could go no further. The poor fugitive resolved to
seek protection, and accordingly hid himself in the woods
near the road, until some one should pass. Soon a traveller
came along, but the slave dared not speak. A few
moments more and a second passed; the fugitive attempted
to speak, but fear deprived him of voice. A
third made his appearance. He wore a broad-brimmed
hat and a long coat, and was evidently walking only for
exercise. William scanned him well, and, though not
much skilled in physiognomy, he concluded he was the
man. William approached him, and asked him if he
knew any one who would help him, as he was sick. The
gentleman asked whether he was not a slave. The poor
slave hesitated; but, on being told that he had nothing
to fear, he answered “Yes.” The gentleman told him
he was in a pro-slavery neighborhood, but, if he would
wait a little, he would go and get a covered wagon, and
convey him to his house. After he had gone, the fugitive
meditated whether he should stay or not, being
apprehensive that the broad-brimmed gentleman had
<pb id="brown26" n="26"/>
gone for some one to assist him: he however concluded
to remain.</p>
        <p>After waiting about an hour—an hour big with fate
to him—he saw the covered-wagon making its appearance,
and no one in it but the person he before accosted.
Trembling with hope and fear, he entered the wagon,
and was carried to the person's house. When he got
there, he still halted between two opinions, whether he
should enter or take to his heels; but he soon decided,
after seeing the glowing face of the wife. He saw something
in her that bid him welcome, something that told
him he would not be betrayed.</p>
        <p>He soon found that he was under the shed of a Quaker,
and a Quaker of the George Fox stamp. He had heard
of Quakers and their kindness; but was not prepared to
meet with such hospitality as now greeted him. He saw
nothing but kind looks, and heard nothing but tender
words. He began to feel the pulsations of a new existence.
White men always scorned him, but now a white
benevolent woman felt glad to wait on him ; it was a
revolution in his experience. The table was loaded with
good things, but he could not eat. If he were allowed
the privilege of sitting in the kitchen, he thought he
could do justice to the viands. The surprise being over,
his appetite soon returned.</p>
        <p>“I have frequently been asked,” says William, “how I felt upon finding myself regarded as a man by a white
family; especially having just run away from one. I
cannot say that I have ever answered the question yet.
The fact that I was, in all probability, a freeman,
sounded in my cars like a charm. I am satisfied that
none but a slave could place such an appreciation upon
<pb id="brown27" n="27"/>
liberty as I did at that time. I wanted to see my mother
and sister, that I might tell them that ‘I was free!’ I
wanted to see my fellow-slaves in St. Louis, and let them
know that the chains were no longer upon my limbs. I
wanted to see Captain Price, and let him learn from my
own lips that I was no more a chattel, but a MAN. I
was anxious, too, thus to inform Mrs. Price that she
must get another coachman, and I wanted to see Eliza
more than I did Mr. Price or Mrs. Price. The fact that
I was a freeman—could walk, talk, eat, and sleep as a
man, and no one to stand over me with the blood-clotted
cow-hide—all this made me feel that I was not myself.”</p>
        <p>The kind Quaker, who so hospitably entertained William,
was called Wells Brown. He remained with him
about a fortnight, during which time he was well fed and
clothed. Before leaving, the Quaker asked him what was
his name besides William. The fugitive told him he had
no other. “Well,” said he, “thee must have another name. Since thee has got out of slavery, thee has become
a man, and men always have two names.”</p>
        <p>William told him that as he was the first man to
extend the hand of friendship to him, he would give him the
privilege of naming him.</p>
        <p>“If I name thee,” said he, “I shall call thee Wells
Brown, like myself.”</p>
        <p>“But,” said he, “I am not willing to lose my name
of William. It was taken from me once against my will,
and I am not willing to part with it on any terms.”</p>
        <p>“Then,” said the benevolent man, “I will call thee
William Wells Brown.”</p>
        <p>“So be it,” said William Wells Brown, and he has
been known by this name ever since.</p>
        <pb id="brown28" n="28"/>
        <p>After giving the newly-christened freeman “a name,”
the Quaker gave him something to aid him to get “a
local habitation.” So, after giving him some money,
Brown again started for Canada. In four days he
reached a public-house, and went in to warm himself.
He soon found that he was not out of the reach of his
enemies. While warming himself, he heard some men in
an adjoining bar-room talking about some runaway
slaves. He thought it was time to be off, and, suiting
the action to the thought, he was soon in the woods out
of sight. When night came, he returned to the road and
walked on; and so, for two days and two nights, till he
 was faint and ready to perish of hunger.</p>
        <p>In this condition he arrived in the town of Cleveland,
Ohio, on the banks of Lake Erie, where he determined
to remain until the spring, of the year, and then to try
and reach Canada. Here he was compelled to work
merely for his food.</p>
        <p>Having tasted the sweets of freedom himself, his great
desire was to extend its blessing to his race, and in the
language of the poet he would ask himself,
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><lg type="stanza"><l>“Is true freedom but to break</l><l>Fetters for our own dear sake,</l><l>And with leathern hearts forget</l><l>That we owe mankind a debt?</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>“No! true freedom is to share</l><l>All the chains our brothers wear,</l><l>And with heart and hand to be</l><l>Earnest to make others free.”</l></lg></lg></q>
While acting as a servant to one of the steamers on Lake
Erie, Brown often took fugitives from Cleveland and
other ports to Buffalo, or Detroit, from either of which
places they could cross to Canada in an hour. During
<pb id="brown29" n="29"/>
the season of 1842, this fugitive slave conveyed no less
than <hi rend="italics">sixty-nine</hi> runaway slaves across Lake Erie, and
placed them safe on the soil of Canada.</p>
        <p>In proportion as his mind expanded under the more
favorable circumstances in which he was placed, Brown
became anxious, not merely for the redemption of his
race from personal slavery, but for the moral and religious
elevation of those who were free. Finding that
habits of intoxication were too prevalent among his
colored brethren, he, in conjunction with others, commenced
a temperance reformation in their body. Such
was the success of their efforts that, in three years, in
the city of Buffalo alone, a society of upwards of five
hundred members was raised out of a colored population
of less than seven hundred. Of that society Mr. Brown
was thrice elected president.</p>
        <p>In the Spring of 1844 he became an agent of the Western
New York Anti-Slavery Society, and afterwards
spent some time in the service of the Massachusetts Society.
In 1849 Mr. Brown embarked for Europe as a
delegate to the Paris Peace Conference.</p>
        <p>The reception of Mr. Brown at the Peace Congress, in
Paris, was most flattering. He admirably maintained his
reputation as a public speaker. His brief address upon
that “war spirit of America, which holds in bondage
nearly four millions of his brethren,” produced a profound
sensation. At its conclusion the speaker was
warmly greeted by Victor Hugo, the Abbé Duguerry,
Emile de Girardin, Richard Cobden, and every man of
note in the assembly. At the soirée given by M. de
Tocqueville, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the
<pb id="brown30" n="30"/>
other fêtes given to the members of the Congress, Mr.
Brown was received with marked attention.</p>
        <p>Having finished his peace mission in France, he returned
to England, where he was received with a hearty
welcome by some of the most influential abolitionists of
that country. Most of the fugitive slaves, and, in fact,
nearly all of the colored men who have visited Great
Britain from the United States, have come upon begging
missions, either for some society or for themselves. Mr.
Brown has been almost the only exception. With that
independence of feeling which those who are acquainted
with him know to be one of his chief characteristics, he
determined to maintain himself and family by his own
exertions,—by his literary labors, and the honorable
profession of a public lecturer. From nearly all the
cities and large provincial towns be received invitations to
lecture or address public meetings. The mayors, or other
citizens of note, presided over many of those meetings.
At Newcastle-upon-Tyne a soirée was given him, and an
address presented by the citizens. A large and influential
meeting was held at Bolton, Lancashire, which was
addressed by Mr. Brown, and at its close the ladies presented
to him the following address:</p>

                <head>“AN ADDRESS PRESENTED TO MR. WILLIAM WELLS BROWN, THE FUGITIVE SLAVE FROM AMERICA, BY THE LADIES OF BOLTON, MARCH 22ND, 1850:</head>
                <p>“DEAR FRIEND AND BROTHER: We cannot permit
you to depart from among us without giving expression
to the feelings which we entertain towards yourself
personally, and to the sympathy which you have awakened
in our breasts for the three millions of our sisters
and brothers who still suffer and groan in the prison-house
<pb id="brown31" n="31"/>
of American bondage. You came among us an
entire stranger; we received you for the sake of your
mission; and having heard the story of your personal
wrongs, and gazed with horror on the atrocities of
slavery as seen through the medium of your touching
descriptions, we are resolved, henceforward, in reliance
on divine assistance, to render what aid we can to the
cause which you have so eloquently pleaded in our
presence.</p>
                <p>“We have no words to express our detestation of the
crimes which, in the name of liberty, are committed in
the country which gave you birth. Language fails to
tell our deep abhorrence of the impiety of those who, in
the still more sacred name of religion, rob immortal beings
not only of an earthly citizenship, but do much to
prevent them from obtaining a heavenly one; and, as
mothers and daughters, we embrace this opportunity of
giving utterance to our utmost indignation at the cruelties
perpetrated upon our sex, by a people professedly
acknowledging the equality of all mankind. Carry with
you, on your return to the land of your nativity, this our
solemn protest against the wicked institution which, like
a dark and baleful cloud, hangs over it; and ask the unfeeling
enslavers, as best you can, to open the prison-doors
to them that are bound, and let the oppressed go
free.</p>
                <p>“Allow us to assure you that your brief sojourn in
our town has been to ourselves, and to vast multitudes,
of a character long to be remembered; and when you
are far removed from us, and toiling, as we hope you
may be long spared to do, in this righteous enterprise, it
may be some solace to your mind to know that your
<pb id="brown32" n="32"/>
name is cherished with affectionate regard, and that the
blessing of the Most High is earnestly supplicated in
behalf of yourself, your family, and the cause to which
you have consecrated your distinguished talents.”</p>

        <p>A most respectable and enthusiastic public meeting
was held at Sheffield to welcome Mr. Brown, and the
next day he was invited to inspect several of the large
establishments there. While going through the manufactory
of Messrs. Broadhead and Atkin, silver and electro-
platers, &amp;c., in Love-street, and whilst he was being
shown through the works, a subscription was hastily set
on foot on his behalf, by the workmen and women of the
establishment, which was presented to Mr. Brown, in the
counting-house, by a deputation of the subscribers. The
spokesman (the designer to Messrs. Broadhead &amp; Atkin),
addressing Mr. Brown on behalf of the work-people,
begged his acceptance of the present as a token of esteem,
as well as an expression of their sympathy in the
cause be advocates, namely, that of the American slave.
Mr. Brown briefly thanked the parties for their spontaneous
free-will offering, accompanied, as it was, by a
generous expression of sympathy for his afflicted brethren
and sisters in bondage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown was in England five years, and during
his sojourn there travelled above twenty-five thousand
miles through Great Britain, addressed more than one
thousand public meetings, lectured in twenty-three mechanics'
and literary institutions, and gave his services
to many of the benevolent and religious societies on the
occasion of their anniversary meetings. After a lecture
which he delivered before the Whittington Club, he
<pb id="brown33" n="33"/>
received from the managers of that institution the following

        <p>ON the 18th July, 1849, I took passage in the steamship
<hi rend="italics">Canada</hi>, Captain Judkins, bound for Liverpool.
The day was a warm one; so much so, that many persons
on board, as well as on shore, stood with their
umbrellas up, so intense was the heat of the sun. The
ringing of the ship's bell was a signal for us to shake
hands with our friends, which we did, and then stepped
on the deck of the noble craft. The <hi rend="italics">Canada</hi> quitted
her moorings at half-past twelve, and we were soon in
motion. As we were passing out of Boston Bay, I took
my stand on the quarter-deck, to take a last farewell
(at least for a time) of my native land. A visit to the
Old World, up to that time, had seemed but a dream. As
<pb id="brown36" n="36"/>
I looked back upon the receding land, recollections of
the past rushed through my mind in quick succession.
From the treatment that I had received from the
Americans as a victim of slavery, and the knowledge
that I was at that time liable to be seized and again
reduced to whips and chains, I had supposed that I
would leave the country without any regret; but in this
I was mistaken, for when I saw the last thread of communication
cut off between me and the land, and the
dim shores dying away in the distance, I almost regretted
that I was not on shore.</p>
        <p>An anticipated trip to a foreign country appears
pleasant when talking about it, especially when surrounded
by friends whom we love; but when we have
left them all behind, it does not seem so pleasant.
Whatever may be the fault of the government under
which we live, and no matter how oppressive her laws
may appear, yet we leave our native land (if such it be)
with feelings akin to sorrow. With the steamer's powerful
engine at work, and with a fair wind, we were
speedily on the bosom of the Atlantic, which was as
calm and as smooth as our own Hudson in its calmest
aspect. We had on board above one hundred passengers,
forty of whom were the “Vienneise children”—a
troop of dancers. The passengers represented several
different nations, English, French, Spaniards, Africans,
and Americans. One man, who had the longest mustache
that mortal man was ever doomed to wear, especially
attracted my attention. He appeared to belong to
<pb id="brown37" n="37"/>
no country in particular, but was yet the busiest man on
board. After viewing for some time the many strange
faces round me, I descended to the cabin to look after
my luggage, which had been put hurriedly on board. I
hope that all who take a trip of so great a distance may
be as fortunate as I was, in being supplied with books to
read on the voyage. My friends had furnished me with
literature, from “Macaulay's History of England” to
“Jane Eyre,” so that I did not want for books to
occupy my time.</p>
        <p>A pleasant passage of about thirty hours brought us
to Halifax, at six o'clock in the evening. In company
with my friend the President of the Oberlin Institute,
I took a stroll through the town; and from what little I
saw of the people in the streets, I am sure that the
taking of the temperance pledge would do them no injury.
Our stay at Halifax was short. Having taken in a
few sacks of coals, the mails, and a limited number of
passengers, we were again out, and soon at sea.</p>
        <p>As the steamer moved gently from the shore I felt
like repeating those lines of a distinguished poet:
<q direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“With thee, my bark, I'll swiftly go</l><l>Athwart the foaming brine;</l><l>Nor care what land thou bear'st me to,</l><l>So not again to mine.</l><l>Welcome, welcome, ye dark blue waves!</l><l>And when you fail my sight</l><l>Welcome ye deserts and ye caves</l><l>My native land, good night!”</l></lg></q></p>
        <pb id="brown38" n="38"/>
        <p>Nothing occurred during the passage to mar the
pleasure which we anticipated from a voyage by sea in such
fine weather. And, after a splendid run of seven days
more, I heard the welcome cry of “Land a-head.” It
was early in the morning, and I was not yet out of bed;
but I had no wish to remain longer in my berth, Although
the passage had been unprecedently short, yet
this news was hailed with joy by all on board.</p>
        <p>For my own part, I was soon on deck. Away in the
distance, and on our larboard quarter, were the gray
hills of old Ireland. Yes; we were in sight of the land
of Curran, Emmet and O'Connell. While I rejoiced
with the other passengers at the sight of land, and the
near approach to the end of our voyage, I felt low-spirited,
because it reminded we of the great distance I
was from home, and of dear ones left behind. But the
experience of above twenty years' travelling had prepared
me to undergo what most persons must, in visiting
a strange country. This was the last day but one
that we were to be on board; and, as if moved by the
sight of land, all seemed to be gathering their different
things together—brushing up their old clothes and putting
on their new ones, as if this would bring them any
sooner to the end of their journey.</p>
        <p>The last night on board was the most pleasant, apparently,
that we had experienced; probably, because it
was the last. The moon was in her meridian splendor,
pouring her broad light over the calm sea; while near to
us, on our starboard side, was a ship, with her snow-white
<pb id="brown39" n="39"/>
sails spread aloft, and stealing through the water
like a thing of life. What can present a more picturesque
view than two vessels at sea on a moonlight
night, and within a few rods of each other? With a
gentle breeze, and the powerful engine at work, we
seemed to be flying to the embrace of our British
neighbors.</p>
        <p>The next morning I was up before the sun, and found
that we were within a few miles of Liverpool. The
taking of a pilot on board at eleven o'clock warned us
to prepare to quit our ocean palace, and seek other quarters.
At a little past three o'clock, the ship cast anchor,
and we were all tumbled, bag and baggage, into a small
steamer, and in a few moments were at the door of the
custom-house. The passage had only been nine days
and twenty-two hours, the quickest on record at that
time, yet it was long enough. I waited nearly three
hours before my name was called, and when it was I
unlocked my trunks and handed them over to one of the
officers, whose dirty hands made no improvement on the
work of the laundress. First one article was taken out,
and then another, till an <hi rend="italics">Iron Collar</hi> that had been
worn by a female slave on the banks of the Mississippi
was hauled out, and this democratic instrument of torture
became the centre of attraction; so much so, that
instead of going on with the examination, all hands
stopped to look at the “Negro Collar.”</p>
        <p>Several of my countrymen who were standing by
were not a little displeased at answers which I gave to
<pb id="brown40" n="40"/>
questions on the subject of slavery; but they held their
peace. The interest created by the appearance of the
iron collar closed the examination of my luggage. As
if afraid that they would find something more hideous,
they put the custom-house mark on each piece, and
passed them out, and I was soon comfortably installed at
Brown's Temperance Hotel, Clayton-square.</p>
        <p>No person of my complexion can visit this country
without being struck with the marked difference between
the English and the Americans. The prejudice which I
have experienced on all and every occasion in the United
States, and to some extent on board the <hi rend="italics">Canada</hi>, vanished
as soon as I set foot on the soil of Britain. In
America I had been bought and sold as a slave in the
Southern States. In the so-called Free States, I had been
treated as one born to occupy an inferior position,—in
steamers, compelled to take my fare on the deck; in
hotels, to take my meals in the kitchen; in coaches, to
ride on the outside; in railways, to ride in the “negro-car;”
and in churches, to sit in the “negro-pew.” But
no sooner was I on British soil, than I was recognized
as a man, and an equal. The very dogs in the streets
appeared conscious of my manhood. Such is the difference,
and such is the change that is brought about by
a trip of nine days in an Atlantic steamer.</p>
        <p>I was not more struck with the treatment of the people
than with the appearance of the great seaport of the
world. The gray stone piers and docks, the dark look
<pb id="brown41" n="41"/>
of the magnificent warehouses, the substantial appearance
of everything around, causes one to think himself
in a new world instead of the old. Everything in Liverpool
looks old, yet nothing is worn out. The beautiful
villas on the opposite side of the river, in the vicinity
of Birkenhead, together with the countless number of
vessels in the river, and the great ships to be seen in the
stream, give life and animation to the whole scene.</p>
        <p>Everything in and about Liverpool seems to be built
for the future as well as the present. We had time to
examine but few of the public buildings, the first of
which was the custom-house, an edifice that would be an
ornament to any city in the world.</p>

        </epigraph>
        <p>AFTER remaining in Liverpool two days, I took passage
in the little steamer <hi rend="italics">Adelaide</hi> for Dublin. The
wind being high on the night of our voyage the vessel
had scarcely got to sea ere we were driven to our berths;
and, though the distance from Liverpool to Dublin is
short, yet, strange to say, I witnessed more effects of the
sea and rolling of the steamer upon the passengers, than
was to be seen during the whole of our voyage from
America. We reached Kingstown, five miles below
Dublin, after a passage of nearly fifteen hours, and were
soon seated on a car, and on our way to the city. While
coming into the bay, one gets a fine view of Dublin and
the surrounding country. Few sheets of water make a
more beautiful appearance than Dublin Bay. We found
it as still and smooth as a mirror, with a soft mist on its
surface,—a strange contrast to the boisterous sea that
we had left a moment before.</p>
        <pb id="brown43" n="43"/>
        <p>The curious phrases of the Irish sounded harshly upon
my ear, probably because they were strange to me. I
lost no time, on reaching the city, in seeking out some to
whom I had letters of introduction, one of whom gave me
an invitation to make his house my home during my stay,
—an invitation which I did not think fit to decline.</p>
        <p>Dublin, the metropolis of Ireland, is a city of above
two hundred thousand inhabitants, and is considered by
the people of Ireland to be the second city in the British
empire. The Liffey, which falls into Dublin Bay a
little below the custom-house, divides the town into two
nearly equal parts. The streets are—some of them—very
fine, especially Sackville-street, in the centre of
which stands a pillar erected to Nelson, England's most
distinguished naval commander. The Bank of Ireland,
to which I paid a visit, is a splendid building, and was
formerly the Parliament House. This magnificent edifice
fronts College Green, and near at hand stands a bronze
statue of William III. The Bank and the Custom-House
are two of the finest monuments of architecture
in the city; the latter of which stands near the river
Liffey, and its front makes an imposing appearance,
extending three hundred and seventy-five feet. It is
built of Portland stone, and is adorned with a beautiful
portico in the centre, consisting of four Doric columns,
supporting an enriched entablature, decorating with a
group of figures in alto-relievo, representing Hibernia
and Britannia presenting emblems of peace and liberty.
A magnificent dome, supporting a cupola, on whose apex
<pb id="brown44" n="44"/>
stands a colossal figure of Hope, rises nobly from the
centre of the building to a height of one hundred and
twenty-five feet. It is, withal, a fine specimen of what
man can do.</p>
        <p>From this noble edifice we bent our steps to another
part of the city, and soon found ourselves in the vicinity
of St. Patrick's, where we had a heart-sickening view of
the poorest of the poor. All the recollections of poverty
which I had ever beheld seemed to disappear in comparison
with what was then before me. We passed a
filthy and noisy market, where fruit and vegetable
women were screaming and begging those passing by to
purchase their commodities; while in and about the
market-place were throngs of beggars fighting for rotten
fruit, cabbage-stocks, and even the very trimmings of
vegetables. On the side-walks were great numbers
hovering about the doors of the more wealthy, and following
strangers, importuning them for “pence to buy
bread.” Sickly and emaciated looking creatures, half
naked, were at our heels at every turn.</p>
        <p>In our return home, we passed through a respectable-looking
street, in which stands a small three-story brick
building, that was pointed out to us as the birthplace of
Thomas Moore, the poet. The following verse from one
of his poems was continually in my mind while viewing
this house:
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“Where is the slave so lowly,</l><l>Condemned to chains unholy,</l><l>Who, could he burst</l><l>His bonds at first,</l><l>Would pine beneath them slowly?”</l></lg></q></p>
        <pb id="brown45" n="45"/>
        <p>The next day was the Sabbath, but it had more the
appearance of a holiday than a day of rest. It had been
announced the day before that the royal fleet was expected,
and at an early hour on Sunday the entire town
seemed to be on the move towards Kingstown, and, as
the family with whom I was staying followed the multitude,
I was not inclined to remain behind, and so went
with them. On reaching the station, we found it utterly
impossible to get standing room in any of the trains,
much less a seat, and therefore determined to reach
Kingstown under the plea of a morning's walk; and in
this we were not alone, for during the walk of five miles
the road was filled with thousands of pedestrians, and
a countless number of carriages, phaëtons, and vehicles of
a more humble order.</p>
        <p>We reached the lower town in time to get a good
dinner, and rest ourselves before going to make further
searches for her majesty's fleet. At a little past four
o'clock, we observed the multitude going towards the pier,
a number of whom were yelling, at the top of their voices,
“It's coming, it's coming!” but on going to the quay
we found that a false alarm had been given. However,
we had been on the look-out but a short time, when a
column or smoke, rising, as it were, out of the sea,
announced that the royal fleet was near at hand. The
concourse in the vicinity or the pier was variously estimated
at from eighty to one hundred thousand.</p>
        <p>It was not long before, the five steamers were entering
the harbor, the one bearing her majesty leading the way
<pb id="brown46" n="46"/>
As each vessel had a number of distinguished persons on
board, the people appeared to be at a loss to know which
was the queen; and as each party made its appearance
on the promenade deck, they were received with great
enthusiasm, the party having the best-looking lady being
received with the greatest applause. The Prince of
Wales, and Prince Alfred, while crossing the deck were
recognized, and greeted with three cheers; the former,
taking off his hat and bowing to the people, showed that
he had had some training as a public man, although not
ten years of age. But not so with Prince Alfred; for,
when his brother turned to him and asked him to take
off his hat, and make a bow to the people, he shook his
head, and said, “No.” This was received with hearty
laughter by those on board, and was responded to by the
thousands on shore. But greater applause was yet in
store for the young prince; for the captain of the
steamer being near by, and seeing that the Prince of
Wales could not prevail on his brother to take off his hat,
stepped up to him and undertook to take it off for him,
when, seemingly to the delight of all, the prince put both
hands to his head, and held his hat fast. This was
regarded as a sign of courage and future renown, and
was received with the greatest enthusiasm, many crying
out, “Good, good! he will make a brave king when his
day comes.”</p>
        <p>After the greetings and applause had been wasted on
many who had appeared on deck, all at once, as if by
some magic power, we beheld a lady, rather small in
<pb id="brown47" n="47"/>
stature, with auburn hair, attired in a plain dress, and
wearing a sky-blue bonnet, standing on the larboard
paddle-box, by the side of a tall, good-looking man, with
a mustache. The thunders of applause that now rent the
air, and cries of “The queen, the queen!” seemed to
set at rest the question of which was her majesty. But
a few moments were allowed to the people to look at the
queen, before she again disappeared; and it was understood
that she would not be seen again that evening. A
rush was then made for the railway, to return to Dublin.</p>
        <p>The seventh of August was a great day in Dublin.
At an early hour the bells began their merry peals, and
the people were soon seen in groups in the streets and
public squares. The hour of ten was fixed for the procession
to leave Kingstown, and it was expected to enter
the city at eleven. The windows of the houses in the
streets through which the royal train was to pass were
at a premium, and seemed to find ready occupants.</p>
        <p>Being invited the day previous to occupy part of a
window in Sackville-street,, I was stationed at my allotted
place at an early hour, with an outstretched neck
and open eyes. My own color differing from those about
me, I attracted not a little attention from many; and
often, when gazing down the street to see if the royal
procession was in sight, would find myself eyed by all
around. But neither while at the window or in the
streets was I once insulted. This was so unlike the
American prejudice, that it seemed strange to me. It
<pb id="brown48" n="48"/>
was near twelve o'clock before the procession entered
Sackville-street, and when it did eyes seemed to beam
with delight. The first carriage contained only her
majesty and the Prince Consort; the second the royal
children, and the third the lords in waiting. Fifteen
carriages were used by those that made up the royal
party. I had a full view of the queen and all who
followed in the train. Her majesty—whether from
actual love for her person, or the novelty of the occasion,
I know not which—was received everywhere with the
greatest enthusiasm. One thing, however, is certain,
and that is, Queen Victoria is beloved by her
subjects.</p>
        <p>But the grand <hi rend="italics">fête</hi> was reserved for the evening.
Great preparations had been made to have a grand illumination
on the occasion, and hints were thrown out that
it would surpass anything every witnessed in London. In
this they were not far out of the way; for all who
witnessed the scene admitted that it could scarcely have
been surpassed. My own idea of an illumination, as I
had seen it in the back-woods of my native land, dwindled
into nothing when compared with this magnificent
affair.</p>
        <p>In the company with few friends, and a lady under my
charge, I undertook to pass through Sackville and one
or two other streets about eight o'clock in the evening,
but we found it utterly impossible to proceed. Masses
thronged the streets, and the wildest enthusiasm seemed
to prevail. In our attempt to cross the bridge, we were
<pb id="brown49" n="49"/>
wedged in and lost our companions; and on one occasion
I was separated from the lady, and took shelter under a
cart standing in the street. After being jammed and
pulled about for nearly two hours, I returned to my
lodgings, where I found part of my company, who
had come in one after another. At eleven o'clock we
had all assembled, and each told his adventures and
“hair-breadth escapes;” and nearly every one had lost
a pocket-handkerchief or something of the kind; my own
was among the missing. However, I lost nothing; for a
benevolent lady, who happened to be one of the company,
presented me with one which was of far more value than
the one I had lost.</p>
        <p>Every one appeared to enjoy the holiday which the
royal visit had caused. But the Irish are indeed a
strange people. How varied their aspect, how contradictory
their character! Ireland, the land of genius
and degradation, of great resources and unparalleled
poverty, noble deeds and the most revolting crimes, the
land of distinguished poets, splendid orators, and the
bravest of soldiers, the land of ignorance and beggary!
Dublin is a splendid city, but its splendor is that of
chiselled marble rather than real life. One cannot
behold these architectural monuments without thinking
of the great men that Ireland has produced. The names
of Burke, Sheridan, Flood, Grattan, O'Connell and
Shiel, have become as familiar to the Americans as
household words. Burke is known as the statesman;
Sheridan for his great speech on the trial of Warren
<pb id="brown50" n="50"/>
Hastings; Grattan for his eloquence; O'Connell as the
agitator, and Shiel as the accomplished orator.</p>
        <p>But, of Ireland's sons, none stands higher in America
than Thomas Moore, the poet. The vigor of his sarcasm,
the glow of his enthusiasm, the coruscations of his fancy,
and the flashing of his wit, seem to be as well understood
in the New World as the Old; and the support which his
pen has given to civil and religious liberty throughout
in the world entitles the Minstrel of Erin to this elevated
position.</p>

        <p>AFTER a pleasant sojourn of three weeks in Ireland,
I took passage in one of the mail-steamers for Liverpool,
and, arriving there, was soon on the road to the metropolis.
The passage from Dublin to Liverpool was an
agreeable one. The rough sea that we passed through
on going to Ireland had given way to a dead calm; and
our noble little steamer, on quitting the Dublin wharf,
seemed to understand that she was to have it all her own
way. During the first part of the evening, the boat
appeared to feel her importance, and, darting through
the water with majestic strides, she left behind her a
dark cloud of smoke suspended in the air like a banner;
while, far astern in the wake of the vessel, could be seen
the rippled waves sparkling in the rays of the moon,
giving strength and beauty to the splendor of the evening.</p>
        <p>On reaching Liverpool, and partaking of a good
breakfast, for which we paid double price, we proceeded
<pb id="brown52" n="52"/>
to the railway station; and were soon going at a rate
unknown to those accustomed to travel only on American
railways. At a little past two o'clock in the afternoon
we saw in the distance the outskirts of London. We
could get but an indistinct view, which had the appearance
of one architectural mass, extending all round to
the horizon, and enveloped in a combination of fog and
smoke; and towering above every other object to be seen
was the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral.</p>
        <p>A few moments more, and we were safely seated in a
“Hansom's Patent,” and on our way to Hughes's—one
of the politest men of the George Fox stamp we have
ever met. Here we found forty or fifty persons, who,
like ourselves, were bound for the Peace Congress. The
Sturges, the Wighams, the Richardsons, the Allens, the
Thomases, and a host of others not less distinguished as
friends of peace, were of the company—of many of whom
I had heard, but none of whom I had ever seen; yet I
was not an entire stranger to many, especially to the
abolitionists. In company with a friend, I sallied forth
after tea to take a view of the city. The evening was
fine—the dense fog and smoke, having to some extent
passed away, left the stars shining brightly, while the
gas-light from the street-lamps and the brilliant shop-windows
gave it the appearance of day-light in a new
form. “What street is this?” we asked. “Cheapside,”
was the reply. The street was thronged, and everybody
seemed to be going at a rapid rate, as if there was something
of importance at the end of the journey. Flying
<pb id="brown53" n="53"/>
vehicles of every description passing each other with a
dangerous rapidity, men with lovely women at their
sides, children running about as if they had lost their
parents—all gave a brilliancy to the scene scarcely to
be excelled. If one wished to get jammed and pushed
about, he need go no further than Cheapside. But
everything of the kind is done with a degree of propriety
in London that would put the New Yorkers to blush.
If you are run over in London, they “beg your pardon;”
if they run over you in New York, you are “laughed at:”
in London, if your hat is knocked off it is picked up
and handed to you; if in New York, you must pick it
up yourself. There is a lack of good manners among
Americans that is scarcely known or understood in Europe.
Our stay in the great metropolis gave us but
little opportunity of seeing much of the place; for in
twenty-four hours after our arrival we joined the rest
of the delegates, and started on our visit to our Gallic
neighbors.</p>
        <p>We assembled at the London Bridge Railway Station,
a few minutes past nine, to the number of six hundred.
The day was fine, and every eye seemed to glow with
enthusiasm. Besides the delegates, there were probably
not less than six hundred more, who had come to see the
company start. We took our seats, and appeared to be
waiting for nothing but the iron-horse to be fastened to
the train, when all at once we were informed that we
must go to the booking-office and change our tickets. At
this news every one appeared to be vexed. This caused
<pb id="brown54" n="54"/>
great trouble; for, on returning to the train, many persons
got into the wrong carriages; and several parties
were separated from their friends, while not a few were
calling out, at the top of their voices, “Where is my
wife! Where is my husband? Where is my luggage?
Who's got my boy? Is this the right train?” “What
is that lady going to do with all these children?” asked
the guard. “Is she a delegate? are all the children
delegates?” In the carriage where I had taken my seat
was a good-looking lady, who gave signs of being very
much annoyed. “It is just so when I am going anywhere:
I never saw the like in my life!” said she. “I
really wish I was at home again.”</p>
        <p>An hour had now elapsed, and we were still at the
station. However, we were soon on our way, and going
at express speed. In passing through Kent we enjoyed
the scenery exceedingly, as the weather was altogether in
our favor; and the drapery which nature hung on the
trees, in the part through which we passed, was in all its
gayety. On our arrival at Folkstone, we found three
steamers in readiness to convey the party to Boulogne.
As soon as the train stopped, a general rush was made
for the steamers, and in a very short time the one in
which I had embarked was passing out of the harbor.
The boat appeared to be conscious that we were going on
a holy mission, and seemed to be proud of her load.
There is nothing in this wide world so like a thing of life
as a steamer, from the breathing of her steam and smoke,
the energy of her motion, and the beauty of her shape;
<pb id="brown55" n="55"/>
while the ease with which she is managed by the command
of a single voice makes her appear as obedient as
the horse is to the rein.</p>
        <p>When we were about half way between the two great
European powers, the officer began to gather the tickets.
The first to whom he applied, and who handed out his
“Excursion Ticket,” was informed that we were all in
the wrong boat. “Is this not one of the boats to take
over the delegates?” asked a pretty little lady, with a
whining voice. “No, madam,” said the captain. “You
must look to the committee for your pay,” said one of the
company to the captain. “I have nothing to do with
committees,” the captain replied. “Your fare, gentlemen,
if you please.”</p>
        <p>Here the whole party were again thrown into confusion.
“Do you hear that? We are in the wrong boat.”
“I knew it would be so,” said Rev. Dr. Ritchie, of
Edinburgh. “It is indeed a pretty piece of work,” said
a plain-looking lady in a handsome bonnet. “When I
go travelling again,” said an elderly-looking gent, with
an eye-glass to his face, “I will take the phaëton and old
Dobbin.” Every one seemed to lay the blame on the
committee, and not, too, without some just grounds.
However, Mr. Sturge, one of the committee, being in the
boat with us, an arrangement was entered into by which
we were not compelled to pay our fare the second time.</p>
        <p>As we neared the French coast, the first object that
attracted our attention was the Napoleon Pillar, on the
top of which is a statue of the emperor in the imperial
<pb id="brown56" n="56"/>
robes. We landed, partook of refreshment that had been
prepared for us, and again repaired to the railway station.
The arrangements for leaving Boulogne were no better
than those at London. But after the delay of another
hour we were again in motion.</p>
        <p>It was a beautiful country through which we passed
from Boulogne to Amiens. Straggling cottages which
bespeak neatness and comfort abound on every side. The
eye wanders over the diversified views with unabated
pleasure, and rests in calm repose upon its superlative
beauty. Indeed, the eye cannot but be gratified at viewing
the entire country from the coast to the metropolis.
Sparkling hamlets spring up, as the steam-horse speeds his
way, at almost every point, showing the progress of civilization,
and the refinement of the nineteenth century.</p>
        <p>We arrived at Paris a few minutes past twelve o'clock
at night, when, according to our tickets, we should have
been there at nine. Elihu Burritt, who had been in
Paris some days, and who had the arrangements there
pretty much his own way, and was at the station waiting the
arrival of the train, and we had demonstrated to us the
best evidence that he understood his business. In no
other place on the whole route had the affairs been so
well managed; for we were seated in our respective carriages
and our luggage placed on the top, and away we
went to our hotels, without the least difficulty or inconvenience.
The champion of an “Ocean Penny Postage”
received, as he deserved, thanks from the whole company
for his admirable management.</p>
        <pb id="brown57" n="57"/>
        <p>The silence of the night was only disturbed by the
rolling of the wheels of the omnibus, as we passed through
the dimly-lighted streets. Where, a few months before,
was to be seen the flash from the cannon and the musket,
and the hearing of the cries and groans behind the barricades,
was now the stillness of death—nothing save here
and there a <foreign id="fre"><hi rend="italics">gens d'arme</hi></foreign> was to be seen going his
rounds in silence.</p>
        <p>The omnibus set us down at the hotel Bedford, Rue de
L'Card, where, although near one o'clock, we found a
good supper waiting for us; and, as I was not devoid of
an appetite, I did my share towards putting it out of the
way.</p>
        <p>The next morning I was up at an early hour, and out
on the Boulevards to see what might be seen. As I was
passing from the hotel to the Place de La Concord, all at
once, and as if by some magic power, I found myself in
front of the most splendid edifice imaginable, situated at
the end of the Rue Nationale. Seeing a number of persons
entering the church at that early hour, and recognizing
among them my friend the President of the
Oberlin (Ohio) Institute, and wishing not to stray too
far from my hotel before breakfast, I followed the crowd
and entered the building. The church itself consisted of
a vast nave, interrupted by four pews on each side,
fronted with lofty fluted Corinthian columns standing on
pedestals, supporting colossal arches, bearing up cupolas
pierced with skylights and adorned with compartments
gorgeously gilt; their corners supported with saints and
<pb id="brown58" n="58"/>
apostles in <hi rend="italics">alto relievo.</hi> The walls of the church were
lined with rich marble, The different paintings and
figures gave the interior an imposing appearance. On
inquiry, I found that I was in the Church of the
Madeleine. It was near this spot that some of the
most interesting scenes occurred during the Revolution
of 1848, which dethroned Louis Philippe. Behind the
Madeleine is a small but well-supplied market; and on
an esplanade east of the edifice a flower-market is held
on Tuesdays and Fridays.</p>
        <p>At eleven o'clock the same day, the Peace Congress
met in the Salle St. Cecile, Rue de la St.
Lazare. The Parisians have no “Exeter Hall;” in
fact, there is no private hall in the city of any size,
save this, where such a meeting could be held. This
hall had been fitted up for the occasion. The room
is long, and at one end has a raised platform; and at the
opposite end is a gallery, with seats raised one above
another. On one side of the hall was a balcony with
sofas, which were evidently the “reserved seats.”</p>
        <p>The hall was filled at an early hour with the delegates,
their friends, and a good sprinkling of the French.
Occasionally, small groups of gentlemen would make
their appearance on the platform, until it soon appeared
that there was little room left for others; and yet the
officers of the Convention had not come in. The different
countries were, many of them, represented here.
England, France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland,
Greece, Spain, and the United States, had each their
<pb id="brown59" n="59"/>
delegates. The assembly began to give signs of impatience,
when very soon the train of officials made their
appearance amid great applause. Victor Hugo led the
way, followed by M. Duguerry, curé of the Madeleine,
Elihu Burritt, and a host of others of less note. Victor
Hugo took the chair as President of the Congress, supported
by vice-presidents from the several nations represented.
Mr. Richard, the secretary, read a dry report
of the names of societies, committees, etc., which was
deemed the opening of the Convention.</p>
        <p>The president then arose, and delivered one of the
most impressive and eloquent appeals in favor of peace
that could possibly be imagined. The effect produced
upon the minds of all present was such as to make the
author of “<hi rend="italics">Notre Dame de Paris</hi>” a great favorite
with the Congress. An English gentleman near me said
to his friend, “I can't understand a word of what he
says, but is it not good?” Victor Hugo concluded his
speech amid the greatest enthusiasm on the part of the
French, which was followed by hurras in the old English
style. The Convention was successively addressed
by the President of the Brussels Peace Society; President
Mahan, of the Oberlin (Ohio) Institute, U. S.;
Henry Vincent; and Richard Cobden. The latter was
not only the <hi rend="italics">lion</hi> of the English delegation, but the
great man of the Convention. When Mr. Cobden speaks
there is no want of hearers. The great power of
this gentleman lies in his facts and his earnestness, for
he cannot be called an eloquent speaker. Mr. Cobden
<pb id="brown60" n="60"/>
addressed the Congress first in French, then in English;
and, with the single exception of Mr. Ewart, M.P.,
was the only one of the English delegation that could
speak to the French in their own language.</p>
        <p>The first day's proceedings were brought to a close at
five o'clock, when the numerous audience dispersed—the
citizens to their homes, and the delegates to see the
sights.</p>
        <p>I was not a little amused at an incident that occurred
at the close of the first session. On the passage from
America, there were in the same steamer with me several
Americans, and among these three or four appeared
to be much annoyed at the fact that I was a passenger,
and enjoying the company of white persons; and, although
I was not openly insulted, I very often heard the
remark, that “That nigger had better be on his master's
farm,” and “What could the American Peace Society
be thinking about, to send a black man as a delegate to
Paris?” Well, at the close of the first sitting of the
convention, and just as I was leaving Victor Hugo, to
whom I had been introduced by an M. P., I observed
near me a gentleman with his hat in hand, whom I
recognized as one of the passengers who had crossed the
Atlantic with me in the Canada, and who appeared to
be the most horrified at having a negro for a fellow-passenger.
This gentleman, as I left M. Hugo, stepped up
to me and said, “How do you do, Mr. Brown?” “You
have the advantage of me,” said I. “O, don't you
know me? I was a fellow-passenger with you from
<pb id="brown61" n="61"/>
America; I wish you would give me an introduction to
Victor Hugo and Mr. Cobden.” I need not inform you
that I declined introducing this pro-slavery American to
these distinguished men. I only allude to this, to show
what a change came over the dreams of my white American
brother by crossing the ocean. The man who would
not have been seen walking with me in the streets of
New York, and who would not have shaken hands with
me with a pair of tongs while on the passage from the
United States, could come with hat in hand in Paris,
and say, “I was your fellow-passenger.” From the
Salle de St. Cecile, I visited the Column Vendome, from
the top of which I obtained a fine view of Paris and its
environs. This is the Bunker Hill Monument of Paris.
On the top of this pillar is a statue of the Emperor
Napoleon, eleven feet high. The monument is built
with stone, and the outside covered with a metallic composition,
made of cannons, guns, spikes, and other warlike
implements taken from the Russians and Austrians
by Napoleon. Above twelve hundred cannons were
melted down to help to create this monument of folly, to
commemorate the success of the French arms in the German
campaign. The column is in imitation of the Trajan
pillar at Rome, and is twelve feet in diameter at the
base. The door at the bottom of the pillar, and where
we entered, was decorated above with crowns of oak,
surmounted by eagles, each weighing five hundred
pounds. The bas-relief of the shaft pursues a spiral
direction to the top, and displays, in a chronological
<pb id="brown62" n="62"/>
order, the principal actions of the French army, from
the departure of the troops from Boulogne to the battle
of Austerlitz. The figures are near three feet high, and
their number said to be two thousand. This sumptuous
monument stands on a plinth of polished granite, surmounted
by an iron railing; and, from its size and position,
has an imposing appearance when seen from any
part of the city.</p>
        <p>Everything here appears strange and peculiar—the
people not less so than their speech. The horses, carriages,
furniture, dress and manners, are in keeping
with their language. The appearance of the laborers
in caps, resembling night-caps, seemed particularly
strange to me. The women without bonnets, and their
caps turned the right side behind, had nothing of the
look of our American women. The prettiest woman I
ever saw was without a bonnet, walking on the Boulevards.
While in Ireland, and during the few days I
was in England, I was struck with the marked difference
between the appearance of the women and those of my
own country. The American women are too tall, too
sallow, and too long-featured, to be called pretty. This
is most probably owing to the fact that in America the
people come to maturity earlier than in most other
countries.</p>
        <p>My first night in Paris was spent with interest. No
place can present greater street attractions than the
Boulevards of Paris. The countless number of cafés,
with tables before the doors, and these surrounded by
<pb id="brown63" n="63"/>
men with long moustaches, with ladies at their sides,
whose very smiles give indication of happiness, together
with the sound of music from the gardens in the rear,

        <p>AFTER the Convention had finished its sittings yesterday,
I accompanied Mrs. C——and sisters to Versailles,
where they are residing during the summer. It was
really pleasing to see among the hundreds of strange
faces in the Convention those distinguished friends of the
slave from Boston.</p>
        <p>Mrs. C——'s residence is directly in front of the
great palace where so many kings have made their
homes, the prince of whom was Louis XIV. The palace
is now unoccupied. No ruler has dared to take up his
residence here since Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette
were driven from it by the mob from Paris on the eighth
of October, 1789. The town looks like the wreck of what
it once was. At the commencement of the first revolution,
it contained one hundred thousand inhabitants; now it
has only about thirty thousand. It seems to be going
back to what it was in the time of Louis XIII., when, in
1624, he built a small brick chateau, and from it arose
<pb id="brown65" n="65"/>
the magnificent palace which now stands here, and which
attracts strangers to it from all parts of the world.</p>
        <p>I arose this morning at an early hour, and took a
walk through the grounds of the palace, and remained
three hours among the fountains and statuary of this
more than splendid place. At ten o'clock we again
returned to Paris, to the Peace Congress.</p>
        <p>The session was opened by a speech from M. Coquerel,
the Protestant clergyman in Paris. His speech was
received with much applause, and seemed to create great
sensation in the Congress, especially at the close of his
remarks, when he was seized by the hand by the Abbe
Duguerry, amid the most deafening and enthusiastic applause
of the entire multitude. The meeting was then
addressed in English by a short gentleman, of florid complexion.
His words seemed to come without the least
difficulty, and his gestures, though somewhat violent,
were evidently studied; and the applause with which he
was greeted by the English delegation showed that he
was a man of no little distinction among them. His
speech was one continuous flow of rapid, fervid eloquence,
that seemed to fire every heart; and although I disliked
his style, I was prepossessed in his favor. This was
Henry Vincent, and his speech was in favor of
disarmament.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vincent was followed by M. Emile de Girardin,
the editor of <hi rend="italics">La Presse</hi>, in one of the most eloquent
speeches that I ever heard; and his exclamation of
“Soldiers of Peace” drew thunders of applause from
<pb id="brown66" n="66"/>
his own countrymen. M. Girardin is not only the leader
of the French press, but is a writer on politics of great
distinction, and a leader of no inconsiderable party in the
National Assembly; although still a young man, apparently
not more than thirty-eight or forty years of
age.</p>
        <p>After a speech from Mr. Ewart, M. P., in French,
and another from Mr. Cobden in the same language, the
Convention was brought to a close for the day. I spent
the morning yesterday in visiting some of the lions of the
French capital, among which was the Louvre. The
French government having kindly ordered that the
members of the Peace Congress should be admitted free,
and without ticket, to all the public works, I had nothing
to do but present my card of membership, and was immediately
admitted.</p>
        <p>The first room I entered was nearly a quarter of a
mile in length; is known as the “Long Gallery,” and
contains some of the finest paintings in the world.
On entering this superb palace, my first impression was
that all Christendom had been robbed, that the Louvre
might make a splendid appearance. This is the Italian
department, and one would suppose by its appearance
that but few paintings had been left in Italy. The
entrance end of the Louvre was for a long time in an
unfinished state, but was afterwards completed by that
master workman, the Emperor Napoleon. It was long
thought that the building would crumble into decay, but
the genius of the great Corsican rescued it from ruin.</p>
        <pb id="brown67" n="67"/>
        <p>During our walk through the Louvre, we saw some
twenty or thirty artists copying paintings; some had
their copies finished and were going out, others half
done, while many had just commenced. I remained some
minutes near a pretty French girl, who was copying a
painting of a dog rescuing a child from a stream of water
into which it had fallen.</p>
        <p>I walked down one side of the hall and up the other,
and was about leaving, when I was informed that this was
only one room, and that a half-dozen more were at my
service; but a clock on a neighboring church reminded
me that I must quit the Louvre for the Salle de St.
Cecile.</p>
        <p>At the meeting of the third session of the Congress, the
hall was filled at an early hour with rather a more
fashionable-looking audience than on any former occasion,
and all appeared anxious for its commencement, as it was
understood to be the last day. After the reading of
several letters from gentlemen, apologizing for their not
being not being able to attend, the speech of Elihu Burritt
was read by a son of M. Coquerel. I felt somewhat astonished
that my countryman, who was said to be master of
fifty languages, had to get some one to read his speech
in French.</p>
        <p>The Abbé Duguerry now came forward amid great
cheering, and said that “the eminent journalist, Girardin,
and the great English logician, Mr. Cobden, had
made it unnecessary for any further advocacy in that
<pb id="brown68" n="68"/>
assembly of the peace cause; that if the principles laid
down in the resolutions were carried out, the work would
be done. He said that the question of general pacification
was built on truth,—truth which emanated from
God,—and it were as vain to undertake to prevent air
from expanding as to check the progress of truth. It
must and would prevail.”</p>
        <p>A pale, thin-faced gentleman next ascended the platform
(or tribune, as it was called) amid shouts of applause
from the English, and began his speech in rather
a low tone, when compared with the sharp voice of Vincent,
or the thunder of the Abbé Duguerry. An audience
is not apt to be pleased or even contented with an
inferior speaker, when surrounded by eloquent men, and
I looked every moment for manifestations of disapprobation,
as I felt certain that the English delegation had
made a mistake in applauding this gentleman, who
seemed to make such an unpromising beginning. But the
speaker soon began to get warm on the subject, and even
at times appeared as if be had spoken before. In a very
short time, with the exception of his own voice, the stillness
of death prevailed throughout the building, and the
speaker delivered one of the most logical speeches made
in the Congress, and, despite of his thin, sallow look,
interested me much more than any whom I had before
heard. Towards the close of his remarks, he was several
times interrupted by manifestations of approbation; and
finally concluded amid great cheering. I inquired the
<pb id="brown69" n="69"/>
gentleman's name, and was informed that it was Edward
Miall, editor of the <hi rend="italics">Nonconformist.</hi></p>
        <p>After speeches from several others, the great Peace
Congress of 1849, which had brought men together from
nearly all the governments of Europe, and many from
America, was brought to a final close by a speech from
the president, returning thanks for the honor that had
been conferred upon him. He said: “My address shall
be short, and yet I have to bid you adieu! How resolve
to do so? Here, during three days, have questions of
the deepest import been discussed, examined, probed to
the bottom; and during these discussions counsels have
been given to governments which they will do well to
profit by. If these days' sittings are attended with no
other result, they will be the means of sowing in the
minds of those present germs of cordiality which must
ripen into good fruit. England, France, Belgium,
Europe and America, would all be drawn closer by these
sittings. Yet the moment to part has arrived, but I can
feel that we are strongly united in heart. But, before
parting, I may congratulate you and myself on the
result of our proceedings. We have been all joined
together without distinction of country; we have all been
united in one common feeling during our three days'
communion. The good work cannot go back; it must
advance, it must be accomplished. The course of the
future may be judged of by the sound of the footsteps of
the past. In the course of that day's discussion, a reminiscence
had been handed up to one of the speakers, that
<pb id="brown70" n="70"/>
this was the anniversary of the dreadful massacre of St.
Bartholomew: the reverend gentleman who was speaking
turned away from the thought of that sanguinary scene
with pious horror, natural to his sacred calling. But I,
who may boast of firmer nerve, I take up the remembrance.
Yes, it was on this day, two hundred and
seventy-seven years ago, that Paris was roused from
slumber by the sound of that bell which bore the name
of <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">cloche d'argent.</hi></foreign> Massacre was on foot, seeking
with keen eye for its victim; man was busy in slaying
man. That slaughter was called forth by mingled passions
of the worst description. Hatred of all kinds was
there urging on the slayer,—hatred of a religious, a
political, a personal character. And yet on the anniversary
of that same day of horror, and in that very city
whose blood was flowing like water, has God this day
given a rendezvous to men of peace, whose wild tumult is
transformed into order, and animosity into love. The
stain of blood is blotted out, and in its place beams forth
a ray of holy light. All distinctions are removed, and
Papist and Huguenot meet together in friendly
communion. (Loud cheers.) Who that thinks of these
amazing changes can doubt of the progress that has been
made But whoever denies the force of progress must
deny God, since progress is the boon of Providence,
and emanated from the great Being above. I feel gratified
for the change that has been effected, and, pointing
solemnly to the past, I say let this day be ever held
memorable; let the twenty-fourth of August, 1572,
<pb id="brown71" n="71"/>
be remembered only for the purpose of being compared
with the twenty-fourth of August, 1849; and when we
think of the latter, and ponder over the high purpose to
which it has been devoted,—the advocacy of the principles
of peace,—let us not be so wanting in reliance on
Providence as to doubt for one moment of the eventual
success of our holy cause.”</p>
        <p>The most enthusiastic cheers followed this interesting
speech. A vote of thanks to the government, and three
times three cheers, with Mr. Cobden as “fugleman,”
ended the great Peace Congress of 1849.</p>
        <p>Time for separating had arrived, yet all seemed unwilling
to leave the place, where, for three days, men of
all creeds and of no creed had met upon one common
platform. In one sense the meeting was a glorious one,
in another it was mere child's play; for the Congress had
been restricted to the discussion of certain topics. They
were permitted to dwell on the blessings of peace, but
were not allowed to say anything about the very subjects
above all others that should have been brought before the
Congress. A French army had invaded Rome and put
down the friends of political and religious freedom, yet
not a word was said in reference to it. The fact is, the
committee permitted the Congress to be gagged before
it had met. They put padlocks upon their own mouths,
and handed the keys to the government. And this was
sorely felt by many of the speakers. Richard Cobden,
who had thundered his anathemas against the corn-laws
of his own country, and against wars in every clime, had
<pb id="brown72" n="72"/>
to sit quiet in his fetters. Henry Vincent, who can
make a louder speech in favor of peace than almost any
other man, and whose denunciations of “all war,” have
gained him no little celebrity with peace men, had to
confine himself to the blessings of peace. O, how I
wished for a Massachusetts atmosphere, a New England
convention platform, with Wendell Phillips as the
speaker, before that assembled multitude from all parts
of the world!</p>
        <p>But the Congress is over, and cannot now be made
different; yet it is to be hoped that neither the London
Peace Committee, nor any other men having the charge
of getting up such another great meeting, will commit
such an error again.</p>

        <p>THE day after the close of the Congress, the delegates
and their friends were invited to a soirée by M. de
Tocqueville, Minister for Foreign Affairs, to take place
on the next evening (Saturday); and, as my colored
face and curly hair did not prevent ray getting an invitation,
I was present with the rest of my peace brethren.</p>
        <p>Had I been in America, where color is considered a
crime, I would not have been seen at such a gathering,
unless as a servant. In company with several delegates,
we left the Bedford Hotel for the mansion of the Minister
of Foreign Affairs; and, on arriving, we found a file
of soldiers drawn up before the gate. This did not seem
much like peace: however, it was merely done in honor
of the company. We entered the building through
massive doors, and resigned ourselves into the hands of
good-looking waiters in white wigs; and, after our names
were duly announced, were passed from room to room,
<pb id="brown74" n="74"/>
till I was presented to Madame de Tocqueville, who was
standing near the centre of the large drawing-room, with
a bouquet in her hand. I was about passing on, when
the gentleman who introduced me intimated that I was 
an “American slave,” At the announcement of this
fact, the distinguished lady extended her hand and gave
me a cordial welcome, at the same time saying, “I
hope you feel yourself free in Paris.” Having accepted
an invitation to a seat by the lady's side, who seated
herself on a sofa, I was soon what I most dislike, “the
observed of all observers.” I recognized, among many
of my own countrymen who were gazing at me, the
American Consul, Mr. Walsh. My position did not improve
his looks. The company present on this occasion
were variously estimated at from one thousand to fifteen
hundred. Among these were the ambassadors from the
different countries represented at the French metropolis,
and many of the <hi rend="italics">élite</hi> of Paris. One could not but be
interested with the difference in dress, looks and manners,
of this assemblage of strangers, whose language was
as different as their general appearance. Delight seemed
to beam in every countenance, as the living stream floated
from one room to another. The house and gardens were
illuminated in the most gorgeous manner. Red, yellow,
blue, green, and many other colored lamps, suspended
from the branches of the trees in the gardens, gave life
and animation to the whole scene out of doors, The
soirée passed off satisfactorily to all parties; and by
twelve o'clock I was again at my hotel.</p>
        <pb id="brown75" n="75"/>
        <p>Through the politeness of the government the members
of the Congress have not only had the pleasure of
seeing all the public works free, and without special
ticket, but the palaces of Versailles and St. Cloud, together
with their splendid grounds, have been thrown
open, and the water-works set to playing in both places.
This mark of respect for the peace movement is commendable
in the French; and were I not such a strenuous
friend of free speech, this act would cause me to overlook
the padlocks that the government put upon our lips
in the Congress.</p>
        <p>Two long trains left Paris at nine o'clock for Versailles;
and at each of the stations the company were
loudly cheered by the people who had assembled to see
them pass. At Versailles we found thousands at the
station, who gave us a most enthusiastic, welcome. We
were blessed with a goodly number of the fair sex, who
always give life and vigor to such scenes. The train
had scarcely stopped, ere the great throng were wending
their ways in different directions,—some to the cafés to get
what an early start prevented their getting before leaving
Paris, and others to see the soldiers who were on
review. But most bent their steps towards the great
palace.</p>
        <p>At eleven o'clock we were summoned to the <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">déjeuner</hi></foreign>
which had been prepared by the English delegates in
honor of their American friends. About six hundred
sat down at the tables. Breakfast being ended, Mr.
Cobden was called to the chair, and several speeches
<pb id="brown76" n="76"/>
were made. Many who had not an opportunity to speak
at the Congress thought this a good chance; and the
written addresses which had been studied during the
passage from America, with the hope that they would
immortalize their authors before the Congress, were
produced at the breakfast-table. But speech-making was
not the order of the day. Too many thundering addresses
had been delivered in the Salle de St. Cecile to
allow the company to sit and hear dryly written and
worse delivered speeches in the Teniscourt.</p>
        <p>There was no limited time given to the speakers, yet
no one had been on his feet five minutes before the
cry was heard from all parts of the house, “Time,
time!” One American was hissed down; another took
his seat with a red face; and a third opened his bundle
of paper, looked around at the audience, made a bow,
and took his seat amid great applause. Yet some speeches
were made, and to good effect; the best of which was by
Elihu Burritt, who was followed by the Rev. James
Freeman Clarke. I regretted very much that the latter
did not deliver his address before the Congress, for he is
a man of no inconsiderable talent, and an acknowledged
friend of the slave.</p>
        <p>The cry of “The water-works are playing!” “The
water is on!” broke up the meeting, without even a vote
of thanks to the chairman; and the whole party were
soon revelling among the fountains and statues of Louis
XIV. Description would fail to give a just idea of the
grandeur and beauty of this splendid place. I do not
<pb id="brown77" n="77"/>
think that anything can surpass the fountain of Neptune,
which stands near the Grand Trianon. One may
easily get lost in wandering through the grounds of
Versailles, but he will always lie in sight of some life-like
statue. These monuments, erected to gratify the
fancy of a licentious king, wake their appearance at
every turn. Two lions, the one overturning a wild boar,
the other a wolf, both the production of Fillen, pointed
out to us the fountain of Diana. But I will not attempt
to describe to you any of the very beautiful sculptured
gods and goddesses here.</p>
        <p>With a single friend I paid a visit to the two Trianons.
The larger was, we were told, just as King Louis Philippe
left it. One room was splendidly fitted up for the reception
of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, who, it appeared,
had promised a visit to the French court ; but the
French monarch ran away from his throne before the
time arrived. The Grand Trianon is not larger than
many noblemen's seats that may be seen in a day's ride
through any part of the British empire. The building
has only a ground floor, but its proportions are very
elegant.</p>
        <p>We next paid our respects to the Little Trianon. This
appears to be the most republican of any of the French
palaces. I inspected this little palace with much
interest, not more for its beauty than because of its having
been the favorite residence of that purest of princesses,
and most affectionate of mothers, Marie Antoinette.
The grounds and building may be said to be only a
<pb id="brown78" n="78"/>
palace in miniature, and this makes it a still more lovely
spot. The building consists of a square pavilion two
stories high and separated entirely from the accessory
buildings, which are on the left, and among them a
pretty chapel. But a wish to be with the multitude,
who were roving among the fountains, cut short my visit
to the Trianons.</p>
        <p>The day was very fine, and the whole party seemed to
enjoy it. It was said that there were more than one
hundred thousand persons at Versailles during the day.
The company appeared to lose themselves with the pleasure
of walking among the trees, flower-beds, fountains,
and statues. I met more than one wife seeking a lost
husband, and <hi rend="italics">vice versa.</hi> Many persons were separated
from their friends, and did not meet them again till at
the hotels in Paris. In the train returning to Paris, an
old gentleman who was seated near me said, “I would
rest contented if I thought I should ever see my wife
again!”</p>
        <p>At four o'clock we were <hi rend="italics">en route</hi> to St. Cloud, the
much-loved and favorite residence of the Emperor
Napoleon. It seemed that all Paris had come out to St.
Cloud to see how the English and Americans would
enjoy the playing of the water-works. Many kings and
rulers of the French have made St. Cloud their residence,
but none have impressed their image so indelibly
upon it as Napoleon. It was here he was first elevated
to power, and here Josephine spent her most happy
hours.</p>
        <pb id="brown79" n="79"/>
        <p>The apartments where Napoleon was married to Marie
Louise, the private rooms of Josephine and Marie
Antoinette, were all in turn shown to us. While standing
on the balcony looking at Paris one cannot wonder
that the emperor should have selected this place as his
residence, for a more lovely spot cannot be found than
St. Cloud.</p>
        <p>The palace is on the side of a hill, two leagues from
Paris, and so situated that it looks down upon the French
capital. Standing, as we did, viewing Paris from St.
Cloud, and the setting sun reflecting upon the domes,
spires, and towers of the city of fashion, made us feel that
this was the place from which the monarch should watch
his subjects. From the hour of arrival at St. Cloud till
near eight o'clock, we were either inspecting the splendid
palace, or roaming the grounds and gardens, whose beautiful
walks and sweet flowers made it appear a very
paradise on earth.</p>
        <p>At eight o'clock the water-works were put in motion,
and the variegated lamps, with their many devices, displaying
flowers, stars and wheels, all with a brilliancy
that can scarcely be described, seemed to throw everything
in the shade we had seen at Versailles. At nine
o'clock the train was announced, and after a good deal
of jamming and pushing about, we were again on the way
to Paris.</p>

        <p>I STARTED at an early hour for the palace of the Tuileries.
A show of my card of membership of the Congress
(which had carried me through so many of the public
buildings) was enough to gain me immediate
admission. The attack of the mob on the palace, on the
20th of June, 1792; the massacre of the Swiss guard, on
the 10th of August of the same year the attack by the
people, in July, 1830, together with the recent flight
of King Louis Philippe and family, made me anxious to
visit the old pile.</p>
        <p>We were taken from room to room, until the entire
building had been inspected. In front of the Tuileries
are a most magnificent garden and grounds. These
were all laid out by Louis XIV., and are left nearly as
they were during that monarch's reign. Above fifty
acres, surrounded by an iron rail-fence, fronts the Place
de la Concorde, and affords a place of promenade for the
<pb id="brown81" n="81"/>
Parisians. I walked the grounds, and saw hundreds of
well-dressed persons under the shade of the great chestnuts,
or sitting on chairs, which were kept to let at two
sous a piece. Near by is the Place de Carrousel, noted
for its historical remembrances. Many incidents connected
with the several revolutions occurred here, and it
is pointed out as the place where Napoleon reviewed
that formidable army of his, before its departure for
Russia.</p>
        <p>From the Tuileries I took a stroll through the Place
de la Concorde, which has connected with it so many
acts of cruelty, that it made me shudder as I passed
over its grounds. As if to take from one's mind the old
associations of this place, the French have erected on it,
or rather given a place to, the celebrated obelisk of
Luxor, which now is the chief attraction on the grounds.
The obelisk was brought from Egypt at an enormous
expense, for which purpose a ship was built, and several
hundred men employed above three years in its removal.
It is formed of the finest red syenite, and covered on
each side with three lines of hieroglyphic inscriptions,
commemorative of Sesostris,—the middle lines being the
most deeply cut and most carefully finished; and the
characters altogether number more than sixteen hundred.
The obelisk is of a single stone, is seventy-two
feet in height, weighs five hundred thousand pounds,
and stands on a block of granite that weighs two hundred
and fifty thousand pounds, He who can read
<pb id="brown82" n="82"/>
Latin will see that the monument tells its own story, but
to me its characters were all blank.</p>
        <p>It would be tedious to follow the history of this old
and venerated stone, which was taken from the quarry
fifteen hundred and fifty years before the birth of Christ,
placed in Thebes, its removal, the journey to the Nile,
and down the Nile, thence to Cherbourg, and lastly its
arrival in Paris on the 23d of December, 1838,—just
one year before I escaped from slavery, The obelisk
was raised on the spot where it now stands, on the 25th
of October; 1836, in the presence of Louis Philippe, and
amid the greetings of one hundred and sixty thousand
persons.</p>
        <p>Having missed my dinner, I crossed over to the Palais
Royal, to a dining saloon, and can assure you that a
better dinner may be had there for three francs than can
be got in New York, for twice that sum,—especially
if the person who wants the dinner is a colored man. I
found no prejudice against my complexion in the Palais
Royal.</p>
        <p>Many of the rooms in this once abode of royalty are
most splendidly furnished, and decorated with valuable
pictures. The likenesses of Madame de Stael, J. J.
Rousseau, Cromwell and Francis I., are among them.</p>
        <p>After several unsuccessful attempts to-day, in company
with R. D. Webb, Esq., to seek out the house
where once resided the notorious Robespierre, I was
fortunate enough to find it, but not until I had lost the
company of my friend, The house is No. 396, Rue St.
<pb id="brown83" n="83"/>
Honore, opposite the Church of the Assumption. It
stands back, and is reached by entering a court, During
the first revolution it was occupied by M. Duplay,
with whom Robespierre lodged. The room used by the
great man of the revolution was pointed out to me. It
is small, and the ceiling low, with two windows looking
out upon the court. The pin upon which the blue coat
once hung is still in the wall. While standing there, I
could almost imagine that I saw the great “Incorruptible,”
sitting at the small table, composing those speeches
which gave him so much power and influence in the convention
and the clubs.</p>
        <p>Here the disciple of Rousseau sat and planned how he
should outdo his enemies and hold on to his friends.
From this room he went forth, followed by his dog
Brunt, to take his solitary walk in a favorite and neighboring
field, or to the fiery discussions of the National
Convention. In the same street is the house in which
Madame Roland—one of Robespierre's victims—
resided.</p>
        <p>A view of the residence of one of the master-spirits of
the French Revolution inclined me to search out more;
and, therefore, I proceeded to the old town, and after
winding through several small streets—some of them so
narrow as not to admit more than one cab at a time—I
found myself in the Rue de L'Ecole de Medecine, and
standing in front of house No. 20. This was the residence,
during the early days of the revolution, of that
blood-thirsty demon in human form, Marat.</p>
        <pb id="brown84" n="84"/>
        <p>As this was private property, my blue card of
membership to the Congress was not available. But after
slipping a franc into the old lady's band, I was
informed that I could be admitted. We entered a court
and ascended a flight of stairs, the entrance to which is
on the right; then, crossing to the left, we were shown
into a moderate-sized room on the first floor, with two
windows looking out upon a yard. Here it was where
the “Friend of the People” (as he styled himself) sat
and wrote those articles that appeared daily in his journal,
urging the people to “hang the rich upon lampposts.”
The place where the bath stood, in which he
was bathing at the time he was killed by Charlotte Corday,
was pointed to us; and even something representing
an old stain of blood was shown as the place where
he was laid when taken out of the bath. The window,
behind whose curtains the heroine hid, after she had
plunged the dagger into the heart of the man whom she
thought was the cause of the shedding of so much blood
by the guillotine, was pointed out with a seeming degree
of pride by the old woman.</p>
        <p>With my Guide Book in hand, I again went forth to
“hunt after new fancies.”</p>
        <p>After walking over the ground where the guillotine
once stood, cutting off its hundred and fifty heads per
day, and then visiting the place where some of the chief
movers in that sanguinary revolution once lived, I felt
little disposed to sleep, when the time for it had arrived.
However, I was out the next morning at an early hour,
<pb id="brown85" n="85"/>
and on the Champs Elysees; and again took a walk over
the place where the guillotine stood when its fatal blade
was sending, so many unprepared spirits into eternity.
When standing here, you have the palace of the Tuileries
on one side, the arch on the other, on a third the
classic Madeline, and on the fourth the National Assembly.
It caused my blood to chill, the idea of being
on the identical spot where the heads of Louis XVI. and
his queen, after being cut off, were held up to satisfy
the blood-thirsty curiosity of the two hundred thousand
persons that were assembled on the Place de la Revolution.
Here royal blood flowed as it never did before or
since. The heads of patricians and plebeians were
thrown into the same basket, without any regard to birth
or station. Here Robespierre and Danton had stood
again and again, and looked their victims in the face as
they ascended the scaffold; and here these same men
had to mount the very scaffold that they bad erected for
others. I wandered up the Seine, till I found myself
looking at the statue of Henry IV., over the principal
entrance of the Hotel de Ville with the
different revolutions, we must come to the conclusion
that it is one of the most remarkable buildings in Paris.
The room was pointed out where Robespierre held his
counsels, and from the windows of which he could look
out upon the Place de Greve, where the guillotine stood
before its removal to the Place de la Concorde, The
room is large, with gilded hangings, splendid old-fashioned
<pb id="brown86" n="86"/>
chandeliers, and a chimney-piece with fine, antiquated
carvings, that give it a venerable appearance.
Here Robespierre not only presided at the counsels that
sent hundreds to the guillotine, but from this same spot
he, with his brother, St. Just and others, were dragged
before the Committee of Public Safety, and thence to
the guillotine, and justice and revenge satisfied.</p>
        <p>The window from which Lafayette addressed the people
in 1830, and presented to them Louis Philippe as
the king, was shown to us. Here the poet, statesman,
philosopher and orator, Lamartine, stood in February,
1848, and, by the power of his eloquence, succeeded in
keeping the people quiet. Here he forced the mob,
braved the bayonets presented to his breast, and, by his
good reasoning, induced them to retain the tri-colored
flag, instead of adopting the red flag, which he considered
the emblem of blood.</p>
        <p>Lamartine is a great heroic genius, dear to liberty and
to France; and successive generations, as they look back
upon the revolution of 1848, will recall to memory the
many dangers which nothing but his dauntless courage
warded off. The difficulties which his wisdom surmounted,
and the good service that he rendered to
France, can never be adequately estimated, or too highly
appreciated. It was at the Hotel de Ville that the
republic of 1848 was proclaimed to the people.</p>
        <p>I next paid my respects to the Column of July, that
stands on the spot formerly occupied by the Bastile. It
is one hundred and sixty-three feet in height, and on the
<pb id="brown87" n="87"/>
top is the Genius of Liberty, with a torch in his right
hand, and in the left a broken chain. After a fatiguing
walk up a winding stair, I obtained a splendid view of
Paris from the top of the column.</p>
        <p>I thought I should not lose the opportunity of seeing
the Church de Notre Dame while so near to it, and,
therefore, made it my next rallying-point. No edifice
connected with religion has had more interesting incidents
occurring in it than this old church. Here Pope
Pius VII. placed the imperial crown on the head of the
Corsican,—or, rather, Napoleon took the crown from his
hands, and placed it on his own head. Satan dragging
the wicked to——, the rider on the red horse at the
opening of the second seal, the blessedness of the saints,
and several other striking sculptured figures, were among
the many curiosities in this splendid place. A hasty view
from the gallery concluded my visit to the Notre Dame.</p>
        <p>Leaving the old church, I strayed off in a direction
towards the Seine, and passed by an old-looking building
of stately appearance, and recognized, among a throng
passing in and out, a number of the members of the Peace
Congress. I joined a party entering, and was soon in
the presence of men with gowns on, and men with long
staffs in their hands, and, on inquiry, found that I was in
the Palais de Justice, beneath which is the Conciergerie,
a noted prison. Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette were
tried and condemned to death here.</p>
        <p>A bas-relief, by Cortat, representing Louis in conference
with his Council, is here seen, But I had visited
<pb id="brown88" n="88"/>
too many places of interest during the day to remain
long in a building surrounded by officers of justice, and
took a stroll upon the Boulevards.</p>
        <p>The Boulevards may be termed the Regent-street of
Paris, or a New Yorker would call it Broadway. While
passing a café, my German friend Faigo, whose company
I had enjoyed during the passage from America, recognized
me, and I sat down and took a cup of delicious
coffee for the first time on the side-walk, in sight of hundreds
who were passing up and down the street every
hour. From three till eleven o'clock, P. M., the Boulevards
are lined with men and women sitting before the
doors of the saloons, drinking their coffee or wines, or
both at the same time, as fancy may dictate. All Paris
appeared to be on the Boulevards, and looking as if the
great end of this life was enjoyment.</p>
        <p>Anxious to see as much as possible of Paris in the
limited time I had to stay in it, I hired a cab on the following
morning, and commenced with the Hotel des
Invalides, a magnificent building, within a few minutes'
walk of the National Assembly. On each side of the
entrance-gate are figures representing nations conquered
by Louis XIV., with colossal statues of Mars and
Minerva. The dome on the edifice is the loftiest in
Paris, the height from the ground being three hundred
and twenty-three feet.</p>
        <p>Immediately below the dome is the tomb of the man at
whose word the world tuned pale. A statue of the
<pb id="brown89" n="89"/>
Emperor Napoleon stands in the second piazza, and is of
the finest bronze.</p>
        <p>This building is the home of the pensioned soldiers of
France. It was enough to make one sick at the idea of
war, to look upon the mangled bodies of these old soldiers.
Men with arms and no legs; others had legs but no
arms; some with canes and crutches, and some wheeling
themselves about in little hand-carts. About three
thousand of the decayed soldiers were lodged in the
Hotel des Invalides, at the time of my visit. Passing
the National Assembly on my return, I spent a moment
or two in it. The interior of this building resembles an
amphitheatre. It is constructed to accommodate nine
hundred members, each having a separate desk. The
seat upon which the Duchess of Orleans and her son, the
Comte de Paris, sat, when they visited the National
Assembly after the flight of Louis Philippe, was shown
with considerable alacrity. As I left the building, I
heard that the president of the republic was on the point
of leaving the Elysee for St. Cloud, and, with the hope
of seeing the “prisoner of Ham,” I directed my cabman
to drive me to the Elysee.</p>
        <p>In a few moments we were between two files of soldiers,
and entering the gates of the palace. I called out
to the driver, and told him to stop; but I was too late,
for we were now in front of the massive doors of the palace,
and a liveried servant opened the cab door, bowed,
and asked if I had an engagement with the president.
You may easily “guess” his surprise when I told him
<pb id="brown90" n="90"/>
no. In my best French I asked the cabman why he had
come to the palace, and was answered, “You told me
to.” By this time a number had gathered round, all
making inquiries as to what I wanted. I told the driver
to retrace his steps, and, amid the shrugs of their shoulders,
the nods of their heads, and the laughter of the
soldiers, I left the Elysee without even a sight of the
president's moustache for my trouble. This was only
one of the many mistakes I made while in Paris.</p>

        <p>HERE I am, within ten leagues of Paris, spending the
time pleasantly in viewing the palace and grounds of the
great chateau of Louis XIV. Fifty-seven years ago, a
mob, composed of men, women and boys, from Paris,
stood in front of this palace, and demanded that the king
should go with them to the capital. I have walked over
the same ground where the one hundred thousand stood
on that interesting occasion. I have been upon the same
balcony, and stood by the window from which Marie
Antoinette looked out upon the mob that were seeking
her life.</p>
        <p>Anxious to see as much of the palace as I could, and
having an offer of the company of my young friend,
Henry G. Chapman, to go through the palace with me, I
<pb id="brown92" n="92"/>
set out early this morning, and was soon in the halls that
had often been trod by royal feet. We passed through
the private as well as the public apartments; through
the secret door by which Marie Antoinette had escaped
from the mob of 1792; and viewed the room in which her
faithful guards were killed, while attempting to save their
royal mistress. I took my seat in one of the little parlor
carriages that had been used in days of yore for the royal
children, while my friend H. G. Chapman drew me
across the room. The superb apartments are not now in
use. Silence is written upon these walls, although upon
them are suspended the portraits of men of whom the
world has heard.</p>
        <p>Paintings representing Napoleon in nearly all his battles
are here seen; and, wherever you see the emperor,
there you will also find Murat, with his white plume
waving above. Callot's painting of the battle of Marengo,
Hue's of the retaking of Genoa, and Bouchat's
of the 18th Brumaire, are of the highest order;
while David has transmitted his fame to posterity by his
splendid painting of the coronation of Napoleon and Josephine
in Notre Dame. When I looked upon the many
beautiful paintings of the last-named artist that adorn
the halls of Versailles, I did not wonder that his fame
should have saved his life when once condemned and
sentenced to death during the reign of terror. The guillotine
was robbed of its intended victim; but the world
gained a great painter. As Boswell transmitted his own
name to posterity with his life of Johnson, so has David
<pb id="brown93" n="93"/>
left his with the magnificent paintings that are now suspended
upon the walls of the palaces of the Louvre, the
Tuileries, St. Cloud, Versailles, and even the little
Elysee.</p>
        <p>After strolling from room to room, we found ourselves
in the Salle du Sacre, Diane, Salon de Mars, de Mercure,
and D'Apollon. I gazed with my eyes turned to
the ceiling till I was dizzy. The Salon de la Guerre is
covered with the most beautiful representations that the
mind of man could conceive, or the hand accomplish.
Louis XIV. is here in all his glory. No Marie Antoinette
will ever do the honors in these halls again.</p>
        <p>After spending a whole day in the palace, and several
mornings in the gardens, I finally bade adieu to the
bronze statue of Louis XIV. that stands in front of the
palace, and left Versailles, probably forever.</p>
        <p>I am now on the point of quitting the French metropolis. I have
occupied the last two days in visiting places
of note in the city. I could not resist the inclination to
pay a second visit to the Louvre. Another hour was
spent in strolling through the Italian Hall, and viewing
the master workmanship of Raphael, the prince of painters.
Time flies, even in such a place as the Louvre,
with all its attractions; and, before I had soon half that
I wished, a ponderous clock near by reminded me of
an engagement, and I reluctantly tore myself from the
splendors of the place.</p>
        <p>During the rest of the day I visited the Jardin des
Plantes, and spent an hour and a half pleasantly in
<pb id="brown94" n="94"/>
walking among plants, flowers, and, in fact, everything
that could be found in any garden in France. From
this place we paid our respects to the Bourse, or Exchange,
one of the most superb buildings in the city.
The ground floor and sides, of the Bourse are of fine
marble, and the names of the chief cities in the world are
inscribed on the medallions which are under the upper
cornice. The interior of the edifice has a most splendid
appearance as you enter it.</p>
        <p>The cemetery of Père la Chaise was too much talked
of by many of our party at the hotel for me to pass it
by; so I took it, after the Bourse. Here lie many of
the great marshals of France, the resting-place of each
marked by the monument that stands over it, except one,
which is marked only by a weeping willow and a plain
stone at its head. This is the grave of Marshal Ney. I
should not have known that it was his, but some unknown
hand had written, with black paint, “Bravest of the
Brave,” on the unlettered stone that stands at the head
of the man who followed Napoleon through nearly all his
battles, and who was shot, after the occupation of Paris
by the allied army. Peace to his ashes! During my
ramble through this noted place, I saw several who were
hanging fresh wreaths of “everlasting flowers” on the
tombs of the departed.</p>
        <p>A ride in an omnibus down the Boulevards, and away
up the Champs Elysees, brought me to the Are de Triomphe;
and, after ascending a flight of one hundred and
sixty-one steps, I was overlooking the city of statuary.
<pb id="brown95" n="95"/>
This stupendous monument was commenced by Napoleon
in 1806 and in 1811 it had only reached the cornice of
the base, where it stopped, and it was left for Louis
Philippe to finish. The first stone of this monument
was laid on the 15th of August, 1806, the birth-day of
the man whose battles it was intended to commemorate.
A model of the arch was erected for Napoleon to pass
through as he was entering the city with Maria Louisa,
after their marriage. The inscriptions on the monument
are many, and the different scenes here represented are
all of the most exquisite workmanship. The genius of
War is summoning the obedient nations to battle. Victory
is here crowning Napoleon after his great success in
1810. Fame stands here recording the exploits of the
warrior, while conquered cities lie beneath the whole.
But it would take more time than I have at command to
give anything like a description of this magnificent piece
of architecture.</p>
        <p>That which seems to take most with Peace Friends is
the portion representing an old man taming a bull for
agricultural labor; while a young warrior is sheathing
his sword, a mother and children sitting at his feet, and
Minerva, crowned with laurels, stands shedding her protecting
influence over them. The erection of this regal
monument is wonderful, to hand down to posterity the
triumphs of the man whom we first hear of as a student
in the military school at Brienne; whom in 1784 we see
in the Ecole Militaire, founded by Louis XV. in 1751;
whom again we find at No. 5 Quai de Court, near Rue
<pb id="brown96" n="96"/>
de Mail; and in 1794 as a lodger at No. 19 Rue de la
Michandère. From this he goes to the Hotel Mirabeau,
Rue du Dauphin, where he resided when he defeated his
enemies on the 13th Vendemaire. The Hotel de la Colonade,
Rue Nouve des Capuchins, is his next residence,
and where be was married to Josephine. From this hotel
he removed to his wife's dwelling in the Rue Chanteriene,
No. 52. In 1796 the young general started for Italy,
where his conquests paved the way for the ever-memorable
18th Brumaire, that made him Dictator of France.
Napoleon was too great now to be satisfied with private
dwellings, and we next trace him to the Elysee, St. Cloud,
Versailles, the Tuileries, Fontainebleau, and, finally, came
his decline, which I need not relate to you.</p>
        <p>After visiting the Gobelins, passing through its many
rooms, seeing here and there a half-finished piece of
tapestry, and meeting a number of the members of the
late Peace Congress, who, like myself, had remained behind
to see more of the beauties of the French capital
than could be seen during the Convention week, I
accepted an invitation to dine with a German gentleman
at the Palais Royal, and was soon revelling amid the
luxuries of the table. I was glad that I had gone to the
Palais Royal, for here I had the honor of an introduction
to M. Beranger, the poet; and, although I had to converse
with him through an interpreter, I enjoyed his
company very much. “The people's poet,” as he is
called, is apparently about seventy years of age, bald on
the top of the bead, and rather corpulent, but of active
<pb id="brown97" n="97"/>
look, and in the enjoyment of good health. Few writers
in France have done better service to the cause of political
and religious freedom than Pierre Jean de Beranger.
He is the dauntless friend and advocate of the downtrodden
poor and oppressed, and has often incurred the
displeasure of the government by the arrows that he has
thrown into their camp. He felt what he wrote; it came
straight from his heart, and went directly to the hearts of
the people. He expressed himself strongly opposed to
slavery, and said, “I don't see how the Americans can
reconcile slavery with their professed love of freedom.”
Dinner out of the way, a walk through the different
apartments, and a stroll over the court, and I bade adieu
to the Palais Royal, satisfied that I should partake of
many worse dinners than I had helped to devour that
day.</p>
        <p>Few nations are more courteous than the French.
Here, the stranger, let him come from what country he
may, and be ever so unacquainted with the people and
language, is sure of a civil reply to any question that
he may ask. With the exception of the egregious blunder
I have mentioned of the cabman driving me to the Elysee,
I was not laughed at once while in France.</p>

        <p>THE SUN had just appeared from behind a cloud and
was setting, and its reflection upon the domes and spires
of the great buildings in Paris made everything appear
lovely and sublime, as the train, with almost lightning
speed, was bringing me from the French metropolis. I
gazed with eager eyes to catch a farewell glance of the
tops of the regal palaces through which I had passed
during a stay of fifteen days in the French capital.</p>
        <p>A pleasant ride of four hours brought us to Boulogne,
where we rested for the night. The next morning I was
up at an early hour, and out viewing the town. Boulogne
could present but little attraction after a fortnight
spent in seeing the lions of Paris. A return to the hotel,
and breakfast over, we stopped on board the steamer, and
were soon crossing the channel. Two hours more, and I
was safely seated in a railway carriage, <hi rend="italics">en route</hi> to the
<pb id="brown99" n="99"/>
English metropolis. We reached London at mid-day,
where I was soon comfortably lodged at 22 Cecil-street,
Strand. As it was three o'clock, I lost no time in seeking
out a dining saloon, which I had no difficulty in finding
in the Strand. It being the first house of the kind I had
entered in London, I was not a little annoyed at the
politeness of the waiter. The first salutation I had, after
seating myself in one of the stalls, was, “Ox tail, sir;
gravy soup; carrot soup, sir; roast beef; roast pork;
boiled beef; roast lamb; boiled leg of mutton, sir, with
caper sauce; jugged hare, sir; boiled knuckle of veal
and bacon; roast turkey and oyster sauce; sucking pig,
sir; curried chicken; harrico mutton, sir.” These, and
many other dishes, which I have forgotten, were called
over with a rapidity that would have done credit to one
of our Yankee pedlers in crying his wares in a New
England village. I was so completely taken by surprise,
that I asked for a “bill of fare,” and told him to leave
me. No city in the world furnishes a cheaper, better,
and quicker meal for the weary traveller, than a London
eating-house.</p>
        <p>A few-days after my arrival in London, I received an
invitation from John Lee, Esq., LL.D., whom I had
met at the Peace Congress in Paris, to pay him a visit at
his seat, near Aylesbury; and as the time was “fixed”
by the doctor, I took the train on the appointed day, on
my way to Hartwell House.</p>
        <p>I had heard much of the aristocracy of England, and
<pb id="brown100" n="100"/>
must confess that I was not a little prejudiced against them.
On a bright sunshiny day, between the hours of
twelve and two, I found myself seated in a carriage, my
back turned upon Aylesbury, the vehicle whirling rapidly
over the smooth macadamised road, and I on my first
visit to an English gentleman. Twenty minutes' ride,
and a turn to the right, and we were amid the fine old
trees of Hartwell Park; one having suspended from its
branches the national banners of several different countries,
among them the “Stars and Stripes.” I felt
glad that my own country's flag had a place there,
although Campbell's lines—
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“United States, your banner wears</l><l>Two emblems,—one of fame;</l><l>Alas! the other that it bears</l><l>Reminds us of your shame!</l><l>The white man's liberty in types</l><l>Stands blazoned by your stars;</l><l>But what's the meaning of your stripes?—</l><l>They mean your Negro-scars”—</l></lg></q>
were at the time continually running through my mind.
Arrived at the door, and we received what every one
does who visits Dr. Lee—a hearty welcome.
I was immediately shown into a room with a lofty ceiling, hung
round with fine specimens of the Italian masters, and told
that this was my apartment. Hartwell House stands in
an extensive park, shaded with trees that made me think
of the oaks and elms in an American forest, and many
of whose limbs had been trimmed and nursed with the
best of care. This was for several years the residence of
<pb id="brown101" n="101"/>
John Hampden the patriot, and more recently that of
Louis XVIII, during his exile in this country. The
house is built on a very extensive scale, and is ornamented
in the interior with carvings in wood of many of
the kings and princes of bygone centuries. A room
some sixty feet by twenty-five contains a variety of
articles that the doctor has collected together—the whole
forming a museum that would be considered a sight in
the Western States of America.</p>
        <p>The morning after my arrival at Hartwell I was up at
an early hour—in fact, before any of the servants—
wandering about through the vast halls, and trying to
find my way out; in which I eventually succeeded, but
not, however, without aid. It had rained the previous
night, and the sun was peeping through a misty cloud as
I strolled through the park, listening to the sweet voices
of the birds that were fluttering in the tops of the trees,
and trimming their wings for a morning flight. The
silence of the night had not yet been broken by the voice
of man; and I wandered about the vast park unannoyed,
except by the dew from the grass that wet my slippers.
Not far from the house I came abruptly upon a beautiful
little pond of water, where the gold-fish were flouncing
about, and the gentle ripples glittering in the sunshine
looked like so many silver minnows playing on the surface.</p>
        <p>While strolling about with pleasure, and only regretting
that my dear daughters were not with me to enjoy
the morning's walk, I saw the gardener on his way to
<pb id="brown102" n="102"/>
the garden. I followed him, and was soon feasting my
eyes upon the richest specimens of garden scenery.
There were the peaches hanging upon the trees that were
fastened to the wall; vegetables, fruit and flowers, were
there in all their bloom and beauty; and even the variegated
geranium of a warmer clime was there in its hothouse
home, and seemed to have forgotten that it was in
a different country from its own. Dr. Lee shows great
taste in the management of his garden. I have seldom
seen a more splendid variety of fruits and flowers in the
Southern States of America than I saw at Hartwell
House.</p>
        <p>I should, however, state that I was not the only guest
at Hartwell during my stay. Dr. Leo had invited
several others of the American delegation to the Peace
Congress, and two or three of the French delegates, who
were on a visit to England, were enjoying the doctor's
hospitality. Dr. Lee is a stanch friend of Temperance,
as well as of the cause of universal freedom. Every
year he treats his tenantry to a dinner, and I need not
add that these are always conducted on the principle of
total abstinence.</p>
        <p>During the second day we visited several of the cottages
of the work-people, and in these I took no little
interest. The people of the United States know nothing
of the real condition of the laboring classes of England.
The peasants of Great Britain are always spoken of as
belonging to the soil. I was taught in America that the
English laborer was no better off than the slave upon a
<pb id="brown103" n="103"/>
Carolina rice-field. I had soon the slaves in Missouri
huddled together, three, four, and even five families in a
single room, not more than fifteen by twenty-five feet
square, and I expected to see the same in England. But
in this I was disappointed. After visiting a new house
that the doctor was building, he took us into one of the
cottages that stood near the road, and gave us an opportunity
of seeing, for the first time, an English peasant's
cot. We entered a low, whitewashed room, with a stone
floor that showed an admirable degree of cleanness.
Before us was a row of shelves filled with earthen dishes
and pewter spoons, glittering as if they had just come
from under the hand of a woman of taste. A “Cobden loaf”
of bread, that had just been left by the baker's
boy, lay upon an oaken table which had been much worn
away with the scrubbing-brush; while just above lay
the old family Bible, that had been handed down
from father to son, until its possession was considered
of almost as great value as its contents. A half-open
door, leading into another room, showed us a clean
bed; the whole presenting as fine a picture of neatness,
order and comfort, as the most fastidious taste could
wish to see. No occupant was present, and therefore I
inspected everything with a greater degree of freedom.
“In front of the cottage was a small grass-plot, with
here and there a bed of flowers, cheated out of its share
of sunshine by the tall holly that had been planted near
it.” As I looked upon the home of the laborer, my
thoughts were with my enslaved countrymen. What a
<pb id="brown104" n="104"/>
difference, thought I, there is between the tillers of the
soil in England and America! There could not be
a more complete refutation of the assertion that the
English laborer is no better off than the American slave,
than the scenes that were then before me. I called the
attention of one of my American friends to a beautiful
rose near the door of the cot, and said to him, “The law
that will protect that flower will also guard and protect
the hand that planted it.” He knew that I had drank
deep of the cup of slavery, was aware of what I meant,
and merely nodded his head in reply. I never experienced
hospitality more genuine; and yet more unpretending,
than was meted out to me while at Hartwell. And
the favorable impression made on my own mind by the
distinguished proprietor of Hartwell Park was nearly as
indelible as my humble name that the doctor had engraven
in a brick, in a vault beneath the Observatory in
Hartwell House.</p>
        <p>On my return to London I accepted an invitation to
join a party on a visit to Windsor Castle; and, taking the
train at the Waterloo Bridge Station; we were soon passing
through a pleasant part of the country. Arrived
at the castle, we committed ourselves into the hands of
the servants, and were introduced into Her Majesty's
State Apartments, Audience Chamber, Vandyck Room,
Waterloo Chambers, Gold Pantry, and many others
whose names I have forgotten. In wandering about the
different apartments I lost my company, and in trying to
find them passed through a room in which hung a magnificent
<pb id="brown105" n="105"/>
portrait of Charles I., by Vandyck. The hum
and noise of my companions had ceased, and I had the
scene and silence to myself. I looked in vain for the
king's evil genius (Cromwell), but he was not in the
same room. The pencil of Sir Peter Lely has left a
splendid full-length likeness of James II. George IV.
is suspended from a peg in the wall, looking as if it was
fresh from the hands of Sir Thomas Lawrence, its admirable
painter. I was now in St. George's Hall, and I
gazed upward to view the beautiful figures on the ceiling
until my neck was nearly out of joint. Leaving this
room, I inspected with interest the ancient <hi rend="italics">keep</hi>
of the castle. In past centuries this part of the palace was
used as a prison. Here James the First of Scotland
was detained a prisoner for eighteen years. I viewed the
window through which the young prince had often looked
to catch a glimpse of the young and beautiful Lady Jane,
daughter of the Earl of Somerset, with whom he was
enamored.</p>
        <p>From the top of the Round Tower I had a fine view
of the surrounding country. Stoke Park, once the
residence of that great friend of humanity and civilization,
William Penn, was among the scenes that I beheld
with pleasure from Windsor Castle. Four years ago,
when in the city of Philadelphia, and hunting up the
places associated with the name of this distinguished
man, and more recently when walking over the farm
once occupied by him, examining the old malt-house
which is now left standing, because of the veneration
<pb id="brown106" n="106"/>
with which the name of the man who built it is held, I
had no idea that I should ever see the dwelling which he
had occupied in the Old World. Stoke Park is about
four miles from Windsor, and is now owned by the Right
Hon. Henry Labouchere.</p>
        <p>The castle, standing as it does on an eminence, and
surrounded by a beautiful valley covered with splendid
villas, has a most magnificent appearance. It rears its
massive towers and irregular walls over and above every
other object. How full this old palace is of material for
thought! How one could ramble here alone, or with
one or two congenial companions, and enjoy a recapitulation
of its history! But an engagement to be at Croydon
in the evening cut short my stay at Windsor, and
compelled me to return to town in advance of my party.</p>
        <p>Having met with John Morland, Esq., at Paris, he gave
me an invitation to visit Croydon, and deliver a lecture
on American Slavery; and last evening, at eight o'clock,
I found myself in a fine old building in the town, and
facing the first English audience that I had seen in the
sea-girt isle. It was my first welcome in England.
The assembly was an enthusiastic one, and made still
more so by the appearance of George Thompson, Esq.,
M. P., upon the platform. It is not my intention to
give accounts of my lectures or meetings in these pages.
I therefore merely say that I left Croydon with a good
impression of the English,, and Heath Lodge with a
<pb id="brown107" n="107"/>
feeling that its occupant was one of the most benevolent
of men.</p>
        <p>The same party with whom I visited Windsor being
supplied with a card of admission to the Bank of England,
I accepted an invitation to be one of the company.
We entered the vast building at a little past twelve
o'clock. The sun threw into the large halls a brilliancy
that seemed to light up the countenances of the almost
countless number of clerks, who were at their desks, or
serving persons at the counters. As nearly all my
countrymen who visit London pay their respects to this
noted institution, I shall sum tip my visit to it by saying
that it surpassed my highest idea of a bank. But a
stroll through this monster building of gold and silver
brought to my mind an incident with which I was connected
a year after my escape from slavery.</p>
        <p>In the autumn of 1835, having been cheated out of
the previous summer's earnings by the captain of the
steamer in which I had been employed running away
with the money, I was, like the rest of the men, left
without any means of support during the winter, and
therefore had to seek employment in the neighboring
towns. I went to the town of Monroe, in the State of
Michigan, and while going through the principal street
looking for work, I passed the door of the only barber in
the town, whose shop appeared to be filled with persons
waiting to be shaved. As there was but one man at
work, and as I had, while employed in the steamer,
occasionally shaved a gentleman who could not perform
<pb id="brown108" n="108"/>
that office himself, it occurred to me that I might get
employment here as a journeyman barber. I therefore
made immediate application for work, but the barber told
me he did not need a hand. But I was not to be put
off so easily, and, after making several offers to work
cheap, I frankly told him that if he would not employ
me I would get a room near to him, and set up an opposition
establishment. This threat, however, made no
impression on the barber; and, as I was leaving, one of
the men who were waiting to be shaved said, “If you
want a room in which to commence business, I have one
on the opposite side of the street.” This man followed
me out; we went over, and I looked at the room. He
strongly urged me to set up, at the same time promising
to give me his influence. I took the room, purchased an
old table, two chairs, got a pole with a red stripe painted
around it, and the next day opened, with a sign over the
door, “Fashionable Hair-dresser from New York,
Emperor of the West.” I need not add that my enterprise
was very annoying to the “shop over the way,”—
especially my sign; which happened to be the most
expensive part of the concern. Of course, I had to tell
all who came in that my neighbor on the opposite side
did not keep clean towels, that his razors were dull, and,
above all, he had never been to New York to see the
fashions. Neither had I. In a few weeks I had the
entire business of the town, to the great discomfiture of
the other barber.</p>
        <p>At this time, money matters in the Western States
<pb id="brown109" n="109"/>
were in a sad condition. Any person who could raise a
small amount of money was permitted to establish a
bank, and allowed to issue notes for four times the sum
raised. This being the case, many persons borrowed
money merely long enough to exhibit to the bank inspectors,
and the borrowed money was returned, and the
bank left without a dollar in its vaults, if, indeed, it had
a vault about its premises. The result was, that banks
were started all over the Western States, and the country
flooded with worthless paper. These were known as
the “Wild-cat Banks.” Silver coin being very scarce,
and the banks not being allowed to issue notes for a
smaller amount than one dollar, several persons put out
notes from six to seventy-five cents in value; these were
called “Shinplasters.” The Shinplaster was in the
shape of a promissory note, made payable on demand.
I have often seen persons with large rolls of these bills,
the whole not amounting to more than five dollars.
Some weeks after I had commenced business on my
“own hook,” I was one evening very much crowded
with customers; and, while they were talking over the
events of the day, one of them said to me, “Emperor,
you seem to be doing a thriving business. You should
do as other business men, issue your Shinplasters.”
This of course, as it was intended, created a laugh; but
with me it was no laughing matter, for from that moment
I began to think seriously of becoming a banker. I
accordingly went a few days after to a printer, and he,
wishing to get the job of printing, urged me to put out
<pb id="brown110" n="110"/>
my notes, and showed me some specimens of engravings
that he had just received from Detroit. My head being
already filled with the idea of a bank, I needed but little
persuasion to set the thing finally afloat. Before I left
the printer the notes were partly in type, and I studying
how I should keep the public from counterfeiting them.
The next day my Shinplasters were handed to me, the
whole amount being twenty dollars, and, after being duly
signed, were ready for circulation. At first my notes did
not take well; they were too new, and viewed with a
suspicious eye. But through the assistance of my customers,
and a good deal of exertion on my own part, my
bills were soon in circulation; and nearly all the money
received in return for my notes was spent in fitting up
and decorating my shop.</p>
        <p>Few bankers got through this world without their
difficulties, and I was not to be an exception. A short
time after my money had been out, a party of young
men, either wishing to pull down my vanity, or to try
the soundness of my bank, determined to give it “a
run.” After collecting together a number of my bills,
they came one at a time to demand other money for
them, and I, not being aware of what was going on, was
taken by surprise. One day, as I was sitting at my
table, strapping some new razors I had just got with the
avails of my “Shinplasters,” one of the men entered and
said, “Emperor, you will oblige me if you will give me
some other money for these notes of yours.” I immediately
cashed the notes with the most worthless of the
<pb id="brown111" n="111"/>
Wild-cat money that I had on hand, but which was a
lawful tender. The young man had scarcely left, when
a second appeared, with a similar amount, and demanded
payment. These were cashed, and soon a third came
with his roll of notes. I paid these with an air of triumph,
although I had but half a dollar left. I began
now to think seriously what I should do, or how to act,
provided another demand should be made. While I was
thus engaged in thought, I saw the fourth man crossing
the street, with a handful of notes, evidently my “Shinplasters.”
I instantaneously shut the door, and, looking
out of the window, said, “I have closed business for
the day; come to-morrow, and I will see you.” In
looking across the street, I saw my rival standing in his
shop-door, grinning and clapping his hands at my apparent
downfall. I was completely “done <hi rend="italics">Brown</hi>” for
the day. However, I was not to be “used up” in this
way; so I escaped by the back door, and went in search
of my friend who had first suggested to me the idea of
issuing notes. I found him, told him of the difficulty I
was in, and wished him to point out a way by which I
might extricate myself. He laughed heartily, and then
said, “You must act as all bankers do in this part of the
country.” I inquired how they did, and he said, “When
your notes are brought to you, you must redeem them,
and then send them out and get other money for them,
and with the latter you can keep cashing your own Shinplasters.”
This was indeed a new idea to me. I immediately
commenced putting in circulation the notes which
<pb id="brown112" n="112"/>
I had just redeemed, and my efforts were crowned with
so much success that, before I slept that night, my
“Shinplasters” were again in circulation, and my bank
once more on a sound basis.</p>
        <p>As I saw the clerks shovelling out the yellow coin
upon the counters of the Bank of England, and men
coming in and going out with weighty bags of the
precious metal in their hands or on their shoulders, I
could not but think of the great contrast between the
monster institution within whose walls I was then standing
and the Wild-cat banks of America!</p>

        <p>I HAVE devoted the past ten days to sight-seeing in
the metropolis, the first two of which were spent in the
British Museum. After procuring a guide-book at the
door as I entered, I seated myself on the first seat that
caught my eye, arranged as well as I could in my mind
the different rooms, and then commenced in good earnest.
The first part I visited was the gallery of antiquities,
through to the north gallery, and thence to the Lycian
room. This place is filled with tombs, bas-reliefs, statues,
and other productions of the same art. Venus, seated,
and smelling a lotus-flower which she held in her hand,
and attended by three Graces, put a stop to the rapid
strides that I was making through this part of the hall.
This is really one of the most precious productions of the
art that I have ever seen. Many of the figures in this
<pb id="brown114" n="114"/>
room are very much mutilated; yet one can linger here
for hours with interest. A good number of the statues
are of uncertain date; they are of great value as works
of art, and more so as a means of enlightening much that
has been obscure with respect to Lycia, an ancient and
celebrated country of Asia Minor.</p>
        <p>In passing through the eastern zoological gallery, I
was surrounded on every side by an army of portraits
suspended upon the walls; and among these was the
Protector. The people of one century kicks his bones
through the streets of London, another puts his portrait
in the British Museum, and a future generation may
possibly give him a place in Westminster Abbey. Such
is the uncertainty of the human character. Yesterday,
a common soldier; to-day, the ruler of an empire; tomorrow,
suspended upon the gallows. In an adjoining
room I saw a portrait of Baxter, which gives one a pretty
good idea of the great nonconformist. In the same room
hung a splendid modern portrait, without any intimation
in the guide-book of who it represented, or when it was
painted. It was so much like one whom I had seen, and
on whom my affections were placed in my younger days,
that I obtained a seat from an adjoining room and rested
myself before it. After sitting half an hour or more, I
wandered to another part of the building, but only to
return again to my “first love,” where I remained till
the throng had disappeared, one after another, and the
officer reminded me that it was time to close.</p>
        <p>It was eight o'clock before I reached my lodgings.
<pb id="brown115" n="115"/>
Although fatigued by the day's exertions, I again resumed
the reading of Roscoe's “Leo X.,” and had nearly
finished seventy-three pages, when the clock on St. Martin's
Church apprised me that it was two. He who
escapes from slavery at the age of twenty years, without
any education, as did the writer of this, must read when
others are asleep, if he would catch up with the rest of
the world. “To be wise,” says Pope, “is but to know
how little can be known.” The true searcher after truth
and knowledge is always like a child; although gaining
strength from year to year, he still “learns to labor and
to wait.” The field of labor is ever expanding before
him, reminding him that he has yet more to learn;
teaching him that he is nothing more than a child in
knowledge and inviting him onward with a thousand
varied charms. The son may take possession of the
father's goods at his death, but he cannot inherit with
the property the father's cultivated mind. He may put
on the father's old coat, but that is all; the immortal
mind of the first wearer has gone to the tomb. Property
may be bequeathed, but knowledge cannot. Then let
him who would be useful in his day and generation be
up and doing. Like the Chinese student who learned
perseverance from the woman whom he saw trying to
rub a crow-bar into a needle, so should we take the
experience of the past to lighten our feet through the
paths of the future.</p>
        <p>The next morning, at ten, I was again at the door of
the great building; was soon within its walls seeing what
<pb id="brown116" n="116"/>
time would not allow of the previous day. I spent some
hours in looking through glass cases, viewing specimens
of minerals such as can scarcely be found in any place
out of the British Museum. During this day I did not
fail to visit the great library. It is a spacious room,
surrounded with large glass cases filled with volumes
whose very look tells you that they are of age. Around,
under the cornice, were arranged a number of old, black-looking,
portraits, in all probability the authors of some
of the works in the glass cases beneath. About the
room were placed long tables, with stands for reading and
writing and around those were a number of men busily
engaged in looking over some chosen author. Old men
with gray hairs, young men with moustaches, some in
cloth, others in fustian,—indicating that men of different
rank can meet here. Not a single word was spoken
during my stay; all appearing to enjoy the silence that
reigned throughout the great room. This is indeed a
retreat from the world. No one inquires who the man is
that is at his side, and each pursues in silence his own
researches. The racing of pens over the sheets of paper
was all that disturbed the stillness of the occasion.</p>
        <p>From the library I strolled to other rooms, and feasted
my eyes on what I had never before seen, He who goes
over this immense building cannot do so without a feeling
of admiration for the men whose energy has brought
together this vast and wonderful collection of things, the
like of which cannot be found in any other museum in
the world. The reflection of the setting sun against a
<pb id="brown117" n="117"/>
mirror in one of the rooms told me that night was approaching,
and I had but a moment in which to take
another look at the portrait that I had seen on the previous day,
and their bade adieu to the museum.</p>
        <p>Having published the narrative of my life and escape
from slavery, and put it into the booksellers' hands, and
seeing a prospect of a fair sale, I ventured to take from
my purse the last sovereign to make up a small sum to
remit to the United States, for the support of my daughters,
who are at school there. Before doing this, however,
I had made arrangements to attend a public meeting in
the city of Worcester, at which the mayor was to preside.
Being informed by the friends of the slave there that I
would in all probability sell a number of copies of my
book, and being told that Worcester was only ten miles
from London, I felt safe in parting with all but a few
shillings, feeling sure that my purse would soon be again
replenished. But you may guess my surprise, when I
learned that Worcester was above a hundred miles from
London, and that I bad not retained money enough to
defray my expenses to the place. In my haste and wish
to make up the ten pounds to send to my children, I had
forgotten that the payment for my lodgings would be
demanded before I should leave town. Saturday morning came;
I paid my lodging-bill, and had three shillings
and fourpence left; and out of this sum I was to get
three dinners, as I was only served with breakfast and
tea at my lodgings.</p>
        <p>Nowhere in the British empire do the people witness
<pb id="brown118" n="118"/>
as dark days as in London. It was on Monday morning,
in the fore part of October, as the clock on St. Martin's
Church was striking ten, that I left my lodging,
and turned into the Strand. The street-lamps were yet burning,
and the shops were all lighted, as if day had not
made its appearance. This great thoroughfare, as usual
at this time of the day, was thronged with business men
going their way, and women sauntering about for pleasure
or for the want of something better to do. I passed
down the Strand to Charing Cross, and looked in vain to
see the majestic statue of Nelson upon the top of the
great shaft. The clock on St. Martin's Church struck
eleven, but my sight could not penetrate through the
dark veil that hung between its face and me. In fact,
day had been completely turned into night; and the
brilliant lights from the shop-windows almost persuaded
me that another day had not appeared. A London fog
cannot be described. To be appreciated, it must be seen,
or, rather, felt, for it is altogether impossible to be clear
and lucid on such a subject. It is the only thing which
gives you an idea of what Milton meant when he talked
of darkness visible. There is a kind of light, to be sure;
but it only serves as a medium for a series of optical illusions;
and, for all useful purposes of vision, the deepest
darkness that ever fell from the heavens is infinitely preferable.
A man perceives a coach a dozen yards off,
and a single stride brings him among the horses' feet; he
sees a gas-light faintly glimmering (as he thinks) at a
distance, but, scarcely has he advanced a stop or two
<pb id="brown119" n="119"/>
towards it, when he becomes convinced of its actual station
by finding his head rattling against the post; and
as for attempting, if you get once mystified, to distinguish
one street from another, it is ridiculous to think
of such a thing.</p>
        <p>Turning, I retraced my steps, and was soon passing
through the massive gates of Temple Bar, wending my
way to the city, when a beggar-boy at my heels accosted
me for a half-penny to buy bread. I had scarcely
served the boy, when I observed near by, and standing
close to a lamp-post, a colored man, and from his general
appearance I was satisfied that he was an American.
He eyed me attentively as I passed him, and seemed
anxious to speak. When I had got some distance from
him I looked back, and his eyes were still upon me. No
longer able to resist the temptation to speak with him,
I returned, and, commencing conversation with him,
learned a little of his history, which was as follows: He
had, he said, escaped from slavery in Maryland, and
reached New York; but not feeling himself secure there,
he had, through the kindness of the captain of an English
ship, made his way to Liverpool; and not being
able to get employment there, he had come up to London.
Here he had met with no better success, and having
been employed in the growing of tobacco, and being
unaccustomed to any other work, he could not get labor
in England. I told him he had better try to get to the
West Indies; but he informed me that he had not a single
penny, and that he had had nothing to eat that day.</p>
        <pb id="brown120" n="120"/>
        <p>By this man's story I was moved to tears, and, going
to a neighboring shop. I took from my purse my last
shilling, changed it, and gave this poor brother fugitive
one half. The poor man burst into tears as I placed the
sixpence in his hand, and said, “You are the first friend
I have met in London.” I bade him farewell, and left
him with a feeling of regret that I could not place him
beyond the reach of want. I went on my way to the
city, and while going through Cheapside a streak of
light appeared in the east, that reminded me that it was
not night. In vain I wandered from street to street,
with the hope that I might meet some one who would
lend me money enough to get to Worcester. Hungry
and fatigued I was returning to my lodgings, when the
great clock of St. Paul's Church, under whose shadow I
was then passing, struck four. A stroll through Fleet-street
and the Strand, and I was again pacing my room.
On my return, I found a letter from Worcester had
arrived in my absence, informing me that a party of gentlemen
would meet me the next day on my reaching that
place, and saying, “Bring plenty of books, as you will
doubtless sell a large number.” The last sixpence had
been spent for postage-stamps, in order to send off some
letters to other places, and I could not even stamp a letter
in answer to the one last from Worcester. The only
vestige of money about me was a smooth farthing that a
little girl had given to me at the meeting at Croydon,
saying, “This is for the slaves.” I was three thousand
miles from home, with but a single farthing in my
<pb id="brown121" n="121"/>
pocket! Where on earth is a man without money more
destitute? The cold hills of the Arctic regions have not
a more hospitable appearance than London to the
stranger with an empty pocket. But whilst I felt depressed
at being in such a sad condition, I was conscious
that I had done right in remitting the last ten pounds to
America. It was for the support of those whom God
had committed to my care, and whom I love as I can no
others. I had no friend in London to whom I could
apply for temporary aid. My friend, Mr. T——, was
out of town, and I did not know his address.</p>
        <p>The dark day was rapidly passing away,—the clock
in the hall had struck six. I had given up all hopes of
reaching Worcester the next day, and bad just rung the
bell for the servant to bring me some tea, when a gentle
tap at the door was heard; the servant entered, and informed
me that a gentleman below was wishing to see
me. I bade her fetch a light and ask him up. The
stranger was my young friend, Frederick Stevenson, son
of the excellent minister of the Borough-Road Chapel.
I had lectured in this chapel a few days previous; and
this young gentleman, with more than ordinary zeal and
enthusiasm for the cause of bleeding humanity, and respect
for me, had gone amongst his father's congregation
and sold a number of copies of my book, and had
come to bring me the money. I wiped the silent tear
from my eyes as the young man placed the thirteen half-crowns
in my hand. I did not let him know under what
obligation I was to him for his disinterested act of kindness.
<pb id="brown122" n="122"/>
He does not know to this day what aid he has
rendered to a stranger in a strange land, and I feel that
I am but discharging in a trifling degree my debt of
gratitude to this young gentleman, in acknowledging my
obligation to him As the man who called for bread and
cheese, when feeling in his pocket for the last threepence
to pay for it, found a sovereign that he was not aware he
possessed, countermanded the order for the lunch, and
bade them bring him the best dinner they could get; so
I told the servant, when she brought the tea, that I had
changed my mind, and should go out to dine. With the
means in my pocket of reaching Worcester the next day,
I sat down to dinner at the Adelphi, with a good cut of
roast beef before me, and felt myself once more at home.
Thus ended a dark day in London.</p>

        </epigraph>
        <p>For some days past the sun has not shown his face;
clouds have obscured the sky, and the rain has fallen in
torrents, which has contributed much to the general
gloom. However, I have spent the time in as agreeable
a manner as I well could. Yesterday I fulfilled an
engagement to dine with a gentleman at the Whittington
Club. One who is unacquainted with the club system as
Carried on in London can scarcely imagine the
conveniences they present. Every member appears to be
<pb id="brown124" n="124"/>
at home, and all seem to own a share in the club.
There is a free-and-easy way with those who frequent
clubs, and a license given there, that is unknown in the
drawing-room of the private mansion. I met the
gentleman at the club at the appointed hour, and after his
writing my name in the visitors book, we proceeded to
the Dining-room where we partook of a good dinner.</p>
        <p>We had been in the room but a short time, when a
small man, dressed in black, with his coat buttoned up
to the chin, entered the saloon, and took a seat at the
table hard by. My friend, in a low whisper, informed
me that this person was one of the French refugees. He
was apparently not more than thirty years of age, and
exceedingly good-looking,—his person being slight, his
feet and hands very small and well-shaped, especially his
hands, which were covered with kid gloves, so tightly
drawn on that the points of the finger-nails were visible
through them. His face was mild and almost womanly
in its beauty, his eyes soft and full, his brow open and
ample, his features well defined, and approaching to the
ideal Greek in contour; the lines about his mouth were
exquisitely sweet, and yet resolute in expression; his
hair was short—his having no moustache gave him
nothing of the look of a Frenchman; and I was not a
little surprised when informed that the person before me
was Louis Blanc. I could scarcely be persuaded to believe
that one so small, so child-like in stature, had
taken a prominent part in the revolution of 1848. He
held in his hand a copy of <hi rend="italics">La Presse</hi>, and as soon as he
<pb id="brown125" n="125"/>
was seated opened it and began to devour its contents.
The gentleman with whom I was dining was not acquainted
with him, but at the close of our dinner he
procured me an introduction through another gentleman.</p>
        <p>As we were returning to our lodgings, we saw in Exeter-street,
Strand, one of those exhibitions that can be
seen in almost any of the streets in the suburbs of the
metropolis, but which is something of a novelty to those
from the other side of the Atlantic. This was an exhibition
of “Punch and Judy.” Everything was in full
operation when we reached the spot. A puppet appeared,
eight or ten inches from the waist upwards, with
an enormous face, huge nose, mouth widely grinning,
projecting chin, cheeks covered with grog-blossoms, a
large protuberance on his back, another on his chest;
yet with these deformities he appeared uncommonly
happy. This was Mr. Punch. He held in his right
hand a tremendous bludgeon, with which he amused
himself by rapping on the head every one who came
within his reach. This exhibition seems very absurd,
yet not less than one hundred were present—children,
boys, old men, and even gentlemen and ladies, were
standing by, and occasionally greeting the performer
with the smile of approbation. Mr. Punch, however,
was not to have it all his own way, for another and better
sort of Punch-like exhibition appeared a few yards
off, that took away Mr. Punch's audience, to the great
dissatisfaction of that gentleman. This was an exhibition
called the Fantoccini, and far superior to any of the
<pb id="brown126" n="126"/>
street performances which I have yet seen. The curtain
rose and displayed a beautiful theatre in miniature, and
most gorgeously painted. The organ which accompanied it
struck up a hornpipe, and a sailor, dressed in his blue
jacket, made his appearance, and commenced keeping
time with the utmost correctness. This figure was not
so long as Mr. Punch, but much better looking. At the
close of the hornpipe the little sailor made a bow, and
tripped off, apparently conscious of having deserved the
undivided applause of the bystanders. The curtain
dropped; but in two or three minutes it was again up, and
a rope was discovered extended on two cross pieces for
dancing upon. The tune was changed to air in
which the time was marked; a graceful figure appeared,
jumped upon the rope with its balance-pole, and displayed
all the manœuvres of an expert performer on the
tight-rope. Many who would turn away in disgust from
Mr. Punch will stand for hours and look at the performances
of the Fantoccini. If people, like the Vicar of
Wakefield, will sometimes “allow themselves to be
happy,” they can hardly fail to have a hearty laugh at
the drolleries of the Fantoccini. There may be degrees
of absurdity in the manner of wasting our time, but there
is an evident affectation in decrying these humble and
innocent exhibitions, by those who will sit till two or
three in the morning to witness a pantomime at a theatre
royal.</p>
        <p>An autumn sun shone brightly through a remarkably
<pb id="brown127" n="127"/>
transparent atmosphere this morning, which was a most
striking contrast to the weather we had had during the
past three days; and I again set out to see some of the
lions of the city, commencing with the Tower of London.
Every American, on returning home from a visit to the
Old World, speaks with pride of the places he saw while
in Europe; and of the many resorts of interest he has
read of, few have made a more lasting impression upon
his memory than the Tower of London. The stories of
the imprisoning of kings and queens, the murdering of
princes, the torturing of men and women, without regard
to birth, education or station, and of the burning and
rebuilding of the old pile, have all sunk deep into his
heart. A walk of twenty minutes, after being set down
at the bank by an omnibus, brought me to the gate of the
Tower. A party of friends who were to meet me there
had not arrived; so I had an opportunity of inspecting the
grounds, and taking a good view of the external appearance
of the old and celebrated building. The Tower is
surrounded by a high wall, and around this a deep ditch
partly filled with stagnated water. The wall encloses
twelve acres of ground, on which stand the several
towers, occupying, with their walks and avenues, the
whole space. The most ancient part of the building is
called the “White Tower,” so as to distinguish it from
the parts more recently built. Its walls are seventeen
feet in thickness, and ninety-two in height, exclusive of
the turrets, of which there are four. My company
arrived, and we entered the Tower through four massive
<pb id="brown128" n="128"/>
gates, the innermost one being pointed out as the
“Water, or Traitors' Gate,” so called from the fact that
it opened to the river, and through it the criminals were
usually brought to the prison within. But this passage
is now closed up. We visited the various apartments in
the old building. The room in the Bloody Tower where
the infant princes were put to death by the command of
their uncle, Richard III, also the recess behind the gate
where the bones of the young princes were concealed,
were shown to us. The warden of the prison, who
showed us through, seemed to have little or no veneration
for Henry VIII.; for he often cracked a joke or
told a story at the expense of the murderer of Anne
Boleyn. The old man wiped the tear from his eye as he
pointed out the grave of Lady Jane Grey. This was
doubtless one of the best as well as most innocent of
those who lost their lives in the Tower; young, virtuous
and handsome, she became a victim to the ambition of
her own and her husband's relations. I tried to count
the names on the wall in “Beauchamp's Tower,” but
they were too numerous. Anne Boleyn was imprisoned
here. The room in the “Brick Tower” where Lady
Jane Grey was imprisoned was pointed out as a place of
interest. We were next shown into the “White Tower.”
We passed through a long room filled with many things
having a warlike appearance; and among them a
number of equestrian figures, as large as life, and clothed
in armor and trappings of the various reigns from
Edward I. to James II., or from 1272 to 1685.
<pb id="brown129" n="129"/>
Elizabeth, or the “Maiden Queen,” as the warden called her,
was the most imposing of the group; she was on a cream-colored
charger. We left the Maiden Queen, to examine
the cloak upon which General Wolf died at the storming
of Quebec. In this room Sir Walter Raleigh was imprisoned,
and here was written his “History of the
World.” In his own hand, upon the wall, is written,
“Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a
crown of life.” His Bible is still shown, with these
memorable lines written in it by himself a short time
before his death:
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“Even such is Time, that takes on trust,</l><l>Our youth, our joy, our all we have,</l><l>And pays us but with age and dust;</l><l>Who in the dark and silent grave,</l><l>When we have wandered all our ways,</l><l>Shuts up the story of our days.”</l></lg></q>
Spears, battle-axes, pikes, helmets, targets, bows and
arrows, and many instruments of torture, whose names I
did not learn, grace the walls of this room. The block
on which the Earl of Essex and Anne Boleyn were beheaded
was shown among other objects of interest. A
view of the “Queen's Jewels” closed our visit to the
Tower. The gold staff of St. Edward, and the Baptismal
Font used at the royal christenings, made of solid
silver, and more than four feet high, were among the
jewels here exhibited. The Sword of Justice was there,
as if to watch the rest of the valuables. However, this
<pb id="brown130" n="130"/>
was not the sword that Peter used. Our acquaintance
with De Foe, Sir Walter Raleigh and Chaucer, through
their writings, and the knowledge that they had been
incarcerated within the walls of the bastile that we were
just leaving, caused us to look back again and again upon
its dark-gray turrets.</p>
        <p>I closed the day with a look at the interior of St.
Paul's Cathedral. A service was just over, and we met
a crowd coming out as we entered the great building.
“Service is over, and tuppence for all that wants to
stay,” was the first sound that caught our ears. In the
Burlesque of “Esmeralda” a man is met in the belfry
of the Notre Dame at Paris, and, being asked for money
by one of the vergers, says,
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“I paid three pence at the door,</l><l>And since I came in a great deal more;</l><l>Upon my honor, you have emptied my purse,—</l><l>St. Paul's Cathedral could not do worse.”</l></lg></q></p>
        <p>I felt inclined to join in this sentiment before I left
the church. A fine statue of “Surly Sam” Johnson
was one of the first things that caught our eyes on looking
around. A statue of Sir Edward Packenham, who
fell at the battle of New Orleans, was on the opposite
side of the great hall. As we had walked over the
ground where the general fell, we viewed his statue
with more than ordinary interest. We were taken from
one scene of interest to another, until we found ourselves
in the “Whispering Gallery.” From the dome we had
<pb id="brown131" n="131"/>
a splendid view of the metropolis of the world. A scaffold
was erected up here to enable an artist to take
sketches, from which a panorama of London was painted.
The artist was three years at work. The painting is now
exhibited at the Colosseum: but the brain of the artist
was turned, and he died insane. Indeed, one can
scarcely conceive how it could be otherwise. You in
America have no idea of the immensity of this building.
Pile together half a dozen of the largest churches in New
York or Boston, and you will have but a faint representation
of St. Paul's Cathedral.</p>
        <p>I have just returned from a stroll of two hours through
Westminster Abbey. We entered the building at a door
near Poet's Corner, and, naturally enough, looked around
for the monuments of the men whose imaginative powers
have contributed so much to instruct and amuse mankind.
I was not a little disappointed in the few I saw.
In almost any church-yard you may see monuments and
tombs far superior to anything in Poets' Corner. A few
only have monuments, Shakespeare, who wrote of man
to man, and for man to the end of time, is honored with
one. Addison's monument is also there; but the greater
number have nothing more erected to their memories
than busts or medallions. Poets' Corner is not splendid
in appearance, yet I observed visitors lingering about it,
as if they were tied to the spot by love and veneration
for some departed friend. All seemed to regard it as
classic ground. No sound louder than a whisper was
<pb id="brown132" n="132"/>
heard during the whole time, except the verger treading
over the marble floor with a light step. There is great
pleasure in sauntering about the tombs of those with
whom we are familiar through their writings; and we
tear ourselves from their ashes, as we would from those
of a bosom friend. The genius of these men spreads
itself over the whole panorama of nature, giving us one
vast and varied picture, the color of which will endure to
the end of time. None can portray like the poet the
passions of the human soul. The statue of Addison, clad
in his dressing-gown, is not far from that of Shakespeare.
He looks as if he had just left the study, after finishing
some chosen paper for the <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>. This momento of
a great man was the work of the British public. Such
a mark of national respect was but justice to the one who
had contributed more to purify and raise the standard of
English literature than any man of his day. We next
visited the other end of the same transept, near the
northern door. Here lie Mansfield, Chatham, Fox, the
second William Pitt, Grattan, Wilberforce and a few
other statesmen. But, above all, is the stately
monument of the Earl of Chatham. In no other place so
small do so many great men lie together. To these men,
whose graves strangers from all parts of the world wish
to view, the British public are in a great measure indebted
for England's fame. The high preeminence which
England has so long enjoyed and maintained in the scale
of empire has constantly been the boast and pride of the
English people. The warm panegyrics that have been
<pb id="brown133" n="133"/>
lavished on her constitution and laws, the songs chanted
to celebrate her glory, the lustre of her arms, as the
glowing theme of her warriors, the thunder of her artillery
in proclaiming her moral prowess, her flag being
unfurled to every breeze and ocean, rolling to her shores
the tribute of a thousand realms, show England to be the
greatest nation in the world, and speak volumes for the
great departed, as well as for those of the living present.
One requires no company, no amusements, no books, in
such a place as this. Time and death have placed within
those walls sufficient to occupy the mind, if one should
stay here a week.</p>
        <p>On my return, I spent an hour very pleasantly in
the Royal Academy, in the same building as the
National Gallery. Many of the paintings here are of a
fine order. Oliver Cromwell looking upon the headless
corpse of King Charles I. appeared to draw the greatest
number of spectators. A scene from “As You Like
It” was one of the best executed pieces we saw. This
was “Rosalind, Celia and Orlando.” The artist did
himself and the subject great credit. Kemble, in Hamlet,
with that ever-memorable skull in his hand, was one
of the pieces which we viewed with no little interest. It
is strange that Hamlet is always represented as a thin,
lean man, when the Hamlet of Shakespeare was a fat,
John Bull kind of a man.</p>
        <p>But the best piece in the gallery was “Dante meditating
the episode of Francesca da Rimini and Paolo
Malatesta, S'Inferno, Canto V.” Our first interest for
<pb id="brown134" n="134"/>
the great Italian poet was created by reading Lord Byron's
poem, “The Lament of Dante.” From that hour
we felt like examining everything connected with the
poet. The history of poets, as well as painters, is written
in their works. The best written life of Goldsmith
is to be found in his poem of “The Traveller,” and his
novel of “The Vicar of Wakefield.” Boswell could not
have written a better life of himself than he has done in
giving the Biography of Dr. Johnson. It seems clear
that no one can be a great poet without having been
sometime during life a lover, and having lost the object
of his affection in some mysterious way. Burns had his
Highland Mary, Byron his Mary, and Dante was not
without his Beatrice. Whether there ever lived such a
person as Beatrice seems to be a question upon which
neither of his biographers has thrown much light.
However, a Beatrice existed in the poet's mind, if not
on earth. His attachment to Beatrice Portinari, and
the linking of her name with the immortality of his
great poem, left an indelible impression upon his future
character. The marriage of the object of his affections
to another, and her subsequent death, and the poet's
exile from his beloved Florence, together with his death
amongst strangers, all give an interest to the poet's
writings which could not be heightened by romance
itself. When exiled and in poverty, Dante found a
friend in the father of Francesca. And here, under the
roof of his protector, he wrote his great poem. The
time the painter has chosen is evening, Day and night
<pb id="brown135" n="135"/>
meet in mid-air: one star is alone visible. Sailing in
vacancy are the shadows of the lovers. The countenance
of Francesca is expressive of hopeless agony. The delineations
are sublime, the conception is of the highest
order, and the execution admirable. Dante is seated in
a marble vestibule, in a meditating attitude, the face
partly concealed by the right hand upon which it is resting.
On the whole, it is an excellently painted piece,
and causes one to go back with a fresh relish to the
Italian's celebrated poem.</p>
        <p>In coming out we stopped a short while in the upper
room of the gallery, and spent a few minutes over a
painting representing Mrs. Siddons in one of Shakspeare's
characters. This is by Sir Joshua Reynolds, and
is only one of the many pieces that we have seen of this
great artist. His genius was vast and powerful in its
grasp, his fancy fertile, and his inventive faculty inexhaustible
in its resources. He displayed the very highest
powers of genius by the thorough originality of his conceptions,
and by the entirely new path that he struck
out in art. Well may Englishmen be proud of his name.
And as time shall step between his day and those that
follow after him, the more will his works be appreciated.
We have since visited his grave, and stood over his
monument in St. Paul's.</p>

        <p>SOME days since, I left the metropolis to fulfil a few
engagements to visit provincial towns; and after a ride
of nearly eight hours, we were in sight of the ancient
city of York. It was night, the moon was in her zenith,
and there seemed nothing between her and the earth but
glittering cold. The moon, the stars, and the innumerable
gas-lights, gave the city a panoramic appearance.
Like a mountain starting out of a plain, there stood the
cathedral in its glory, looking down upon the surrounding
buildings, with all the appearance of a Gulliver
standing over the Lilliputians. Night gave us no opportunity
to view the minster. However, we were up the
next morning before the sun, and walking round the
<pb id="brown137" n="137"/>
cathedral with a degree of curiosity seldom excited
within us. It is thought that a building of the same
dimensions would take fifty years to complete it at the
present time, even with all the improvements of the
nineteenth century, and would cost no less than the enormous
sum of two millions of pounds sterling. From
what I had heard of this famous cathedral, my expectations
were raised to the highest point; but it surpassed
all the idea that I had formed of it. On entering the
building, we lost all thought of the external appearance
by the matchless beauty of the interior. The echo produced
by the tread of our feet upon the floor as we
entered, resounding through the aisles, seemed to say,
“Put off your shoes, for the place whereon you tread is
holy ground.” We stood with hat in hand, and gazed
with wonder and astonishment down the incomparable
vista of more than five hundred feet. The organ, which
stands near the centre of the building, is said to be one
of the finest in the world. A wall, in front of which is
a screen of the most gorgeous and florid architecture, and
executed in solid stone, separates the nave from the service
choir. The beautiful workmanship of this makes it
appear so perfect, as almost to produce the belief that it
is tracery-work of wood. We ascended the rough stone
steps through a winding stair to the turrets, where we
had such a view of the surrounding country as can be
obtained from no other place. On the top of the centre
and highest turret is a grotesque figure of a fiddler;
rather a strange-looking object, we thought, to occupy
<pb id="brown138" n="138"/>
the most elevated pinnacle on the house of God. All
dwellings in the neighborhood appear like so many
dwarfs crouching at the feet of the minister; while its own
vastness and beauty impress the observer with feelings
of awe and sublimity. As we stood upon the top of this
stupendous mountain of ecclesiastical architecture, and
surveyed the picturesque hills and valleys around,
imagination recalled the tumult of the sanguinary battles
fought in sight of the edifice. The rebellion of Octavius
near three thousand years ago, his defeat and flight to
the Scots, his return and triumph over the Romans, and
being crowned king of all Britain; the assassination of
Oswald, King of the Northumbrians; the flaying alive
of Osbert; the crowning of Richard III.; the siege by
William the Conqueror; the siege by Cromwell, and
the pomp and splendor with which the different monarchs
had been received in York, all appeared to be vividly
before me. While we were thus calling to our aid our
knowledge of history, a sweet peal from the lungs of the
ponderous organ below cut short our stay among the turrets,
and we descend to have our organ of tune gratified,
as well as to finish the inspection of the interior.</p>
        <p>I have heard the sublime melodies of Handel, Haydn
and Mozart, performed by the most skilful musicians;
I have listened with delight and awe to the soul-moving
compositions of those masters, as they have been chanted
in the most magnificent churches; but never did I hear
such music, and played upon such an instrument, as that
sent forth by the great organ in the Cathedral of York.
<pb id="brown139" n="139"/>
The verger took much delight in showing us the horn
that was once mounted with gold, but is now garnished
with brass. We viewed the monuments and tombs of
the departed, and then spent an hour before the great
north window. The design on the painted glass, which
tradition states was given to the church by five virgin
sisters, is the finest thing of the kind in Great Britain.
I felt a relief on once more coming into the open air, and
again beholding Nature's own sunlight. The splendid
ruin of St. Mary's Abbey, with its eight beautiful
light Gothic windows, next attracted our attention. A
visit to the castle finished our stay in York; and as we
were leaving the old city, we almost imagined that we
heard the chiming of the bells for the celebration of the
first Christian Sabbath, with Prince Arthur as the presiding
genius.</p>
        <p>England stands preëminently the first government in the
world for freedom of speech and of the press. Not even
in our own beloved America can the man who feels himself
oppressed speak as he can in Great Britain. In
some parts of England, however, the freedom of thought
is tolerated to a greater extent than in others; and of
the places favorable to reforms of all kinds, calculated to
elevate and benefit mankind, Newcastle-on-Tyne doubtless
takes the lead. Surrounded by innumerable coal-mines,
it furnishes employment for a large laboring
population, many of whom take a deep interest in the
passing events of the day, and, consequently, are a reading
<pb id="brown140" n="140"/>
class. The public debater or speaker, no matter
what may be his subject, who fails to get an audience in
other towns, is sure of a gathering in the Music Hall,
or Lecture Room, in Newcastle.</p>
        <p>Here I first had an opportunity of coming in contact
with a portion of the laboring people of Britain. I
have addressed large and influential meetings in Newcastle
and the neighboring towns, and the more I see and
learn of the condition of the working-classes of England,
the more I am satisfied of the utter fallacy of the statements
often made that their condition approximates to that
of the slaves of America. Whatever may be the disadvantages
that the British peasant labors under, he is free;
and if he is not satisfied with his employer, he can make
choice of another. He also has the right to educate
his children; and he is the equal of most wealthy person
before an English court of justice. But how is
it with the American slave? He has no right to himself;
no right to protect his wife, his child, or his own
person. He is nothing more than a living tool. Beyond
his field or workshop he knows nothing. There is
no amount of ignorance he is not capable of. He has
not the least idea of the face of this earth, nor of the
history or constitution of the country in which he dwells.
To him the literature, science and art, the progressive
history and the accumulated discoveries of by-gone
ages, are as if they had never been. The past is to him
as yesterday. Ancestral monuments he has none; written documents,
<pb id="brown141" n="141"/>
fraught with cogitations of other times, he has
none; and any instrumentality calculated to awaken and
expound the intellectual activity and comprehension of a
present or approaching generation, he has none. His
condition is that of the leopard of his own native Africa.
It lives, it propagates its kind; but never does it indicate
a movement towards that all but angelic intelligence of
man. The slave eats, drinks and sleeps, all for the
benefit of the man who claims his body as his property.
Before the tribunals of his country he has no voice. He
has no higher appeal than the mere will of his owner.
He knows nothing of the inspired Apostles through their
writings. He has no Sabbath, no church, no Bible, no
means of grace,—and yet we are told that he is as well
off as the laboring classes of England. It is not enough
that the people of my country should point to their
Declaration of Independence, which declares that “all
men are created equal.” It is not enough that they
should laud to the skies a constitution containing boasting
declarations in favor of freedom. It is not enough that
they should extol the genius of Washington, the patriotism
of Henry, or the enthusiasm of Otis. The time has
come when nations are judged by the acts of the present,
instead of the past. And so it must be with
America. In no place in the United Kingdom has the
American slave warmer friends than in Newcastle.</p>
        <p>I am now in Sheffield, and have just returned from a
visit to James Montgomery, the poet. In company with
<pb id="brown142" n="142"/>
James Wall, Esq. I proceeded to the Mount, the residence
of Mr. Montgomery; and our names being sent in,
we were soon in the presence of the “Christian poet.” He
held in his left hand the <hi rend="italics">Eclectic Review</hi>for the month,
and with the right gave me a hearty shake, and bade me
“Welcome to Old England.” He was anything but like
the portraits I had seen of him, and the man I had in
my mind's eye. I had just been reading his “Pelican Island,”
and I eyed the poet with no little interest. He
is under the middle size; his forehead high and well
formed, the top of which was a little bald; his hair of a
yellowish color, his eyes rather small and deep-set, the
nose long and slightly <sic corr="aquiline">acquiline</sic>, his mouth rather small,
and not at all pretty. He was dressed in black, and a
large white cravat entirely hid his neck and chin; his
having been afflicted from childhood with salt-rheum
was doubtless the cause of his chin being so completely
buried in the neckcloth. Upon the whole, he looked
more like one of our American Methodist parsons than
any one I have seen in this country. He entered freely
into conversation with us. He said he should be glad to
attend my lecture that evening, but that he had long
since quit going out at night. He mentioned having
heard William Lloyd Garrison some years before, and
with whom he was well pleased. He said it had long
been a puzzle to him how Americans could hold slaves
and still retain their membership in the churches. When
we rose to leave, the old man took my hand between his
two, and with tears in his eyes said, “Go on your
<pb id="brown143" n="143"/>
Christian mission, and may the Lord protect and prosper you!
Your enslaved countrymen have my sympathy, and shall
have my prayers.” Thus ended our visit to the bard of
Sheffield. Long after I had quitted the presence of the
poet, the following lines of his were ringing in my ears:
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“Wanderer, whither dost thou roam?</l><l>Weary wanderer, old and gray,</l><l>Wherefore hast thou left thine home,</l><l>In the sunset of thy day?</l><l>Welcome, wanderer, as thou art,</l><l>All my blessings to partake;</l><l>Yet thrice welcome to my heart,</l><l>For thine injured people's sake.</l><l>Wanderer, wither wouldst thou roam?</l><l>To what region far away?</l><l>Bend thy steps to find a home,</l><l>In the twilight of thy day,</l><l>Where a tyrant never trod,</l><l>Where a slave was never known—</l><l>But where Nature worships God</l><l>In the wilderness alone.”</l></lg></q></p>
        <p>Mr. Montgomery seems to have thrown his entire soul
into his meditations on the wrongs of Switzerland. The
poem which we have just quoted is unquestionably one
of his best productions, and contains more of the fire of
enthusiasm than all his other works. We feel a reverence
almost amounting to superstition for the poet who
deals with nature. And who is more capable of understanding
the human heart than the poet? Who has better
known the human feelings than Shakespeare; better
<pb id="brown144" n="144"/>
painted than Milton the grandeur of virtue; better
sighed than Byron over the subtle weaknesses of Hope?
Who ever had a sounder taste, a more exact intellect,
than Dante? or who has ever tuned his harp more in
favor of freedom than our own Whittier?</p>

        <p>IN passing through Yorkshire, we could not resist the
temptation it offered to pay a visit to the extensive and
interesting ruin of Kirkstall Abbey, which lies embosomed
in a beautiful recess of Airedale, about three miles
from Leeds. A pleasant drive over a smooth road
brought us abruptly in sight of the Abbey. The tranquil
and pensive beauty of the desolate monastery, as it
reposes in the lap of pastoral luxuriance, and amidst the
touching associations of seven centuries, is almost beyond
description, when viewed from where we first beheld it.
After arriving at its base, we stood for some moments
under the mighty arches that lead into the great hall,
gazing at its old gray walls frowning with age. At the
distance of a small field, the Aire is seen gliding past
the foot of the lawn on which the ruin stands, after it
has left those precincts, sparkling over a weir with a
<pb id="brown146" n="146"/>
pleasing murmur. We could fully enter into the feelings
of the poet when he says:
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“Beautiful fabric! even in decay</l><l>And desolation, beauty still is thine;</l><l>As the rich sunset of an autumn day,</l><l>When gorgeous clouds in glorious hues combine</l><l>To render homage to its slow decline,</l><l>Is more majestic in its parting hour:</l><l>Even so thy mouldering, venerable shrine</l><l>Possesses now a more subduing power</l><l>Than in thine earlier sway, with pomp and pride thy dower.”</l></lg></q></p>
        <p>The tale of “Mary, the Maid of the Inn,” is supposed,
and not without foundation, to be connected with
this abbey. “Hark to Rover,” the name of the house
where the key is kept, was, a century ago, a retired inn
or pot-house, and the haunt of many a desperate highwayman
and poacher. The anecdote is so well known
that it is scarcely necessary to relate it. It, however, is
briefly this:</p>
        <p>“One stormy night, as two travellers sat at the inn,
each having exhausted his news, the conversation was
directed to the abbey, the boisterous night, and Mary's
heroism; when a bet was at last made by one of them,
that she would not go and bring back from the nave a
slip of the alder-tree growing there. Mary, however,
did go; but, having nearly reached the tree, she heard a
low, indistinct dialogue; at the same time, something
black fell and rolled towards her, which afterwards
proved to be a hat. Directing her attention to the place
whence the conversation proceeded, she saw, from behind
<pb id="brown147" n="147"/>
a pillar, two men carrying a murdered body: they
passed near the place where she stood, a heavy cloud was
swept from off the face of the moon, and Mary fell senseless—
one of the murderers was her intended husband!
She was awakened from her swoon, but—her reason
had fled forever.” Mr. Southey wrote a beautiful
poem founded on this story, which will be found in his
published works. We spent nearly three hours in wandering
through these splendid ruins. It is both curious
and interesting to trace the early history of these old
piles, which become the resort of thousands, nine tenths
of whom are unaware either of the classic ground on
which they tread, or of the peculiar interest thrown
around the spot by the deeds of remote ages.</p>
        <p>During our stay in Leeds, we had the good fortune to
become acquainted with Wilson Armistead, Esq. This
gentleman is well known as an able writer against slavery.
His most elaborate work is “A Tribute for the
Negro.” This is a volume of five hundred and sixty
pages, and is replete with facts refuting the charges of
inferiority brought against the negro race. Few English, gentlemen
have done, more to hasten the day of the slave's
liberation than Wilson Armistead.</p>
        <p>A few days after, I paid a visit to Newstead Abbey,
the far-famed residence of Lord Byron. I posted from Hucknall
over to Newstead one pleasant morning, and,
being provided with a letter of introduction to Colonel
Wildman, I lost no time in presenting myself at the door
of the abbey. But, unfortunately for me, the colonel
<pb id="brown148" n="148"/>
was at Mansfield, in attendance at the Assizes—he
being one of the county magistrates. I did not, however,
lose the object of my visit, as every attention was paid
in showing me about the premises. I felt as every one
must who gazes for the first time upon these walls, and
remembers that it was here, even amid the comparative
ruins of a building once dedicated to the sacred cause of
Religion and her twin sister, Charity, that the genius of
Byron was first developed; here that he paced with
youthful melancholy the halls of his illustrious ancestors,
and <sic corr="trod">trode</sic> the walls of the long-banished monks. The
housekeeper—a remarkably good-looking and polite
woman—showed us through the different apartments,
and explained in the most minute manner every object
of interest connected with the interior of the building.
We first visited the Monk's Parlor, which seemed to
contain nothing of note, except a very fine-stained window—
one of the figures representing St. Paul, surmounted
by a cross. We passed Lord Byron's
Bed-room, the Haunted Chamber, the Library and the
Eastern Corridor, and halted in the Tapestry Bed-room,
which is truly a magnificent apartment, formed by the
Byrons for the use of King Charles II. The ceiling is
richly decorated with the Byron arms. We next visited
the grand Drawing-room, probably the finest in the
building. The saloon contains a large number of splendid 
portraits, among which is the celebrated portrait of
Lord Byron, by Phillips. In this room we took into
<pb n="149"/>
our hand the skull-cup, of which so much has been written,
and that has on it:
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><lg type="stanza"><l>“Start not—nor deem my spirit fled;</l><l>In me behold the only skull</l><l>From which, unlike a living head,</l><l>Whatever flows is never dull.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>“I lived, I loved, I quaffed like thee;</l><l>I died—let earth my bones resign:</l><l>Fill up—thou canst not injure me;</l><l>The worm hath fouler lips than thine.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>“Better to hold the sparkling grape,</l><l>Than nurse the earth-worm's slimy brood</l><l>And circle in the goblet's shape,</l><l>The drink of gods, than reptile's food.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>“Where once my wit, perchance, hath shone,</l><l>In aid of others let me shine;</l><l>And when, alas! our brains are gone,</l><l>What nobler substitute than wine?</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>“Quaff while thou canst—another race,</l><l>When thou and thine like thee are sped,</l><l>May rescue thee from earth's embrace,</l><l>And rhyme and revel with the dead.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>“Why not? since through life's little day</l><l>Our heads such sad effects produce;</l><l>Redeemed from worms and wasting clay,</l><l>This chance is theirs, to be of use.”</l></lg></lg></q></p>
        <p>Leaving this noble room, We descended by a polished
oak steps into the West Corridor, from which we
entered the grand Dining Hall, and through several
other rooms, until we reached the Chapel. Here we
<pb id="brown150" n="150"/>
were shown a stone coffin which had been found near the
high altar, when the workmen were excavating the vault
intended by Lord Byron for himself and his dog. The
coffin contained the skeleton of all abbot, and also 
the identical skull from which the cup of which I have 
made mention was made. We then left the building,
and took a stroll through the grounds. After passing a 
pond of cold crystal water, we came to a dark wood, in 
which are two leaden statues of Pan, and a female satyr—
very fine specimens as works of art. We here inspected 
the tree whereon Byron carved his own name and that of 
his sister, with the date, all of which are still legible. 
However, the tree is now dead, and we were informed that 
Colonel Wildman intended to have it cut down, so as to 
preserve the part containing the inscription. After 
crossing an interesting and picturesque part of the 
gardens, we arrived within the precincts of the ancient 
chapel, near which we observed a neat marble monument, 
and which we supposed to have been erected to the memory 
of some of the Byrons; but, on drawing near to it, we read 
the following inscription:
<q type="inscription" direct="unspecified"><p>“Near this spot are deposited the Remains of one who 
possessed Beauty without Vanity, Strength without Insolence, 
Courage without Ferocity, and all the Virtues of Man without 
his Vices. This Praise, which would be unmeaning Flattery 
if inscribed over human ashes, is but a just tribute to the 
Memory of BOATSWAIN, a Dog, who was born at Newfoundland, 
May, 1803, and died at Newstead Abbey, Nov. 18, 1808.</p><lg type="verse"><l>“When some proud son of man returns to earth,</l><l>Unknown to glory, but upheld by birth,</l><l>The sculptured art exhausts the pomp of woe,</l><l>And storied urns record who rests below;</l><pb id="brown151" n="151"/><l>When all is done, upon the tomb is seen </l><l>Not what he was, but what he should have been. </l><l>But the poor dog, in life the firmest friend, </l><l>The first to welcome, foremost to defend, </l><l>Whose honest heart is still his master's own, </l><l>Who labors, fights, lives, breathes for him alone, </l><l>Unhonored falls, unnoticed all his worth, </l><l>Denied in heaven the soul he held on earth;</l><l>While man, vain insect! hopes to be forgiven, </l><l>And claims himself a sole, exclusive heaven. </l><l>O, man! thou feeble tenant of an hour, </l><l>Debased by slavery, or corrupt by power, </l><l>Who knows thee well must quit thee with disgust, </l><l>Degraded mass of animated dust;</l><l>Thy love is lust, thy friendship all a cheat, </l><l>Thy smiles hypocrisy, thy words deceit!</l><l>By nature vile, ennobled but by name, </l><l>Each kindred brute might bid thee blush for shame. </l><l>Ye, who perchance behold this simple urn, </l><l>Pass on—it honors none you wish to mourn: </l><l>To mark a friend's remains these stones arise; </l><l>I never knew but one,—and here he lies.”</l></lg></q></p>
        <p>By a will which his lordship executed in 1811, he directed 
that his own body should be buried in a vault in the 
garden, near his faithful dog. This feeling of affection 
to his dumb and faithful follower, commendable in itself, 
seems here to have been carried beyond the bounds of 
reason and propriety.</p>
        <p>In another part of the grounds we saw the oak-tree planted 
by the poet himself. It has now attained a goodly size, 
considering the growth of the oak, and bids fair to become 
a lasting memento to the noble bard, and to be a shrine 
to which thousands of pilgrims will resort
<pb id="brown152" n="152"/>
in future ages, to do homage to his mighty genius. This
tree promises to share in after times the celebrity of
Shakspeare's mulberry, and Pope's willow. Near by, and
in the tall trees, the rooks were keeping up a tremendous
noise. After seeing everything of interest connected
with the great poet, we entered our chaise, and left the
premises. As we were leaving, I turned to take a farewell 
look at the abbey, standing in solemn grandeur,
the long ivy clinging fondly to the rich tracery of a
former age. Proceeding to the little town of Hucknall, 
we entered the old gray parish church, which has for
ages been the last resting-place of the Byrons, and where
repose the ashes of the poet, marked by a neat marble 
slab, bearing the following inscription:</p>
        <lg type="inscription">
          <l>In the vault beneath,</l>
          <l>where many of his Ancestors and his Mother are</l>
          <l>Buried,</l>
          <l>lie the remains of</l>
          <l>GEORGE GORDON NOEL BYRON,</l>
          <l>Lord Byron, of Rochdale,</l>
          <l>in the County of Lancaster,</l>
          <l>the author of “Childe Harold's Pilgrimage.”</l>
          <l>He was born in London, on the</l>
          <l>22nd of January, 1788.</l>
          <l>He died at Missolonghi, in Western Greece, on the</l>
          <l>19th of April, 1824,</l>
          <l>Engaged in the glorious attempt to restore that</l>
          <l>country to her ancient grandeur and renown.</l>
          <l>His Sister, the Honorable</l>
          <l>Augusta Maria Leigh,</l>
          <l>placed this Tablet to his Memory.</l>
        </lg>
        <pb id="brown153" n="153"/>
        <p>From an Album that is kept for visitors to register
their names in, I copied the following lines, composed by
William Howitt, immediately after the interment:
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“Rest in thy tomb, young heir of glory, rest! </l><l>Rest in thy rustic tomb, which thou shalt make </l><l>A spot of light upon thy country's breast, </l><l>Known, honored, haunted ever for thy sake. </l><l>Thither romantic pilgrims shall betake </l><l>Themselves from distant lands. When we are still </l><l>In centuries of sleep, thy fame shall wake, </l><l>And thy great memory with deep feelings fill </l><l>These scenes which thou hast trod, and hallow every hill.”</l></lg></q></p>
        <p>This closed my visit to the interesting scenes associated 
with Byron's strange and eventful history—scenes that 
ever acquire a growing charm as the lapse of years softens 
the errors of the man, and confirms the genius of the poet.</p>
        <p>The following lines, written by Byron in early life, were 
realized in his death in a foreign land:</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <lg type="stanza">
            <l>“When Time or soon or late shall bring</l>

          <lg type="stanza">

        <p>IT was on a lovely morning that I found myself on board the 
little steamer <hi rend="italics">Wye</hi>, passing out of Bristol harbor. In 
going down the river, we saw on our right the stupendous 
rocks of St. Vincent towering some four or five hundred 
feet above our heads. By the swiftness of our fairy 
steamer, we were soon abreast of Cook's Folly, a singular 
tower, built by a man from whom it takes its name, and of 
which the following romantic story is told: “Some years 
since a gentleman; of the name of Cook, erected this tower, 
which has since gone by the name of ‘Cook's Folly.’ A son 
having been born, he was desirous of ascertaining, by means 
of astrology, if he would live to enjoy his property. Being 
himself a firm
<pb id="brown155" n="155"/>
believer, like the poet Dryden, that certain information 
might be obtained from the above science, he caused the
child's horoscope to be drawn, and found, to his dismay, 
that in his third, sixteenth, or twenty-first year, he 
would be in danger of meeting with some fearful calamity 
or sudden death, to avert which he caused the turret to 
be constructed, and the child placed therein. Secure, as 
he vainly thought, there he lived, attended by a faithful 
servant, their food and fuel being conveyed to them by 
means of a pulley-basket, until he was old enough to wait 
upon himself. On the eve of his twenty-first year his 
parent's hopes rose high, and great were the rejoicings 
prepared to welcome the young heir to his home. But, alas! 
no human skill could avert the dark fate which clung to 
him. The last night he had to pass alone in the turret, 
a bundle of fagots was conveyed to him as usual, in which 
lay concealed a viper, which clung to his hand. The bite 
was fatal; and, instead of being borne in triumph, the 
dead body of his only son was the sad spectacle which met 
the sight of his father.”</p>
        <p>We crossed the channel, and soon entered the mouth of that 
most picturesque of rivers, the Wye. As we neared the town 
of Chepstow the old castle made its appearance, and a fine 
old ruin it is. Being previously provided with a letter of 
introduction to a gentleman in Chepstow, I lost no time in 
finding him out. This gentleman gave me a cordial 
reception, and did what Englishmen seldom ever do, lent me 
his saddle-horse to ride to the abbey. While lunch was in 
preparation I took a
<pb id="brown156" n="156"/>
stroll through the castle which stood near by. We entered 
the castle through the great doorway, and were soon 
treading the walls that had once sustained the cannon and 
the sentinel, but were now covered with weeds and 
wild-flowers. The drum and fife had once been heard within 
these walls—the only music now is the cawing of the 
rook and daw. We paid a hasty visit to the various 
apartments, remaining longest in those of most interest. 
The room in which Martin the Regicide was imprisoned nearly 
twenty years was pointed out <sic corr="to">to to</sic> us. The Castle of 
Chepstow is still a magnificent pile, towering upon the 
brink of a stupendous cliff, on reaching the top of which, 
we had a splendid view of the surrounding country. Time, 
however, compelled us to retrace our steps, and, after 
partaking of a lunch, we mounted a horse for the first time 
in ten years, and started for Tintern Abbey. The distance 
from Chepstow to the abbey is about five miles, and the road 
lies along the banks of the river. The river is walled in 
on either side by hills of much beauty, clothed from base 
to summit with the richest verdure. I can conceive of 
nothing more striking than the first appearance of the abbey.
As we rounded a hill, all at once we saw the old ruin 
standing before us in all its splendor. This celebrated 
ecclesiastical relic of the olden time is doubtless the 
finest ruin of its kind in Europe. Embosomed amongst hills, 
and situated on the banks of the most fairy-like river in 
the world, its beauty can scarcely be surpassed. We halted 
at the “Beaufort Arms,” left our horse, and 
<pb id="brown157" n="157"/>
sallied forth to view the abbey. The sun was pouring a 
flood of light upon the old gray walls, lighting up its 
dark recesses, as if to give us a better opportunity of 
viewing it. I gazed with astonishment and admiration at 
its many beauties, and especially at the superb Gothic 
windows over the entrance-door. The beautiful Gothic 
pillars, with here and there a representation of a praying 
priest, and mailed knights, with saints and Christian 
martyrs, and the hundreds of Scriptural representations, 
all indicate that this was a place of considerable 
importance in its palmy days. The once stone floor had 
disappeared, and we found ourselves standing on a floor of 
unbroken green grass, swelling back to the old walls, and 
looking so verdant and silken that it seemed the very 
floor of fancy. There are more romantic and wilder places 
than this in the world, but none more beautiful. The 
preservation of these old abbeys should claim the attention 
of those under whose charge they are, and we felt like 
joining with the poet, and saying—
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“O ye who dwell</l><l>Around yon ruins, guard the precious charge</l><l>From hands profane! O save the sacred pile—</l><l>O'er which the wing of centuries has flown</l><l>Darkly and silently, deep-shadowing all</l><l>Its pristine honors—from the ruthless grasp</l><l>Of future violation!”</l></lg></q></p>
        <p>In contemplating these ruins more closely, the mind
insensibly reverts to the period of feudal and regal 
oppression, when structures like that of Tintern Abbey
<pb id="brown158" n="158"/>
necessarily became the scenes of stirring and 
highly-important events. How altered is the scene! Where 
were formerly magnificence and splendor, the glittering 
array of priestly prowess, the crowded halls of haughty 
bigots, and the prison of religious offenders, there is 
now but a heap of mouldering ruins. The oppressed and the 
oppressor have long since lain down together in the 
peaceful grave. The ruin, generally speaking, is unusually 
perfect, and the sculpture still beautifully sharp. The 
outward walls are nearly entire, and are thickly clad with 
ivy. Many of the windows are also in a good state of 
preservation; but the roof has long since fallen in.
The feathered songsters were fluttering about, and pouring 
forth their artless lays as a tribute of joy; while the 
lowing of the herds, the bleating of flocks, and the hum 
of bees upon the farm near by, all burst upon the ear, 
and gave the scene a picturesque sublimity that can be 
easier imagined than described. Most assuredly Shakspeare 
had such ruins in view when he exclaimed,
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces, </l><l>The solemn temples, the great globe itself,</l><l>Yes, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,</l><l>And, like the baseless fabric of a vision,</l><l>Leave not a wreck behind.”</l></lg></q></p>
        <p>In the afternoon we returned to Bristol, and I spent the 
greater part or the next day in examining the interior of 
Redcliffe Church. Few places in the west of England have 
greater claims upon the topographer and
<pb id="brown159" n="159"/>
historian than the church of Mary's, Redcliffe. Its 
antiquity, the beauty of its architecture, and, above 
all, the interesting circumstances connected with its 
history, entitle it to peculiar notice. It is also 
associated with the enterprise of genius; for its name has 
been blended with the reputation of Rowley, of Canynge, 
and of Chatterton, and no lover of poetry and admirer of 
art can visit it without a degree of enthusiasm. And, when 
the old building shall have mouldered into ruins, even 
these will be trodden with veneration, as sacred to the 
recollection of genius of the highest order. Ascending a 
winding stair, we were shown into the treasury room. The 
room forms an irregular octagon, admitting light through 
narrow, unglazed apertures, upon the broken and scattered 
fragments of the famous Rowleian chests, that, with the 
rubble and dust of centuries, cover the floor. It is here 
creative fancy pictures forth the sad image of the spirit 
of the spot—the ardent boy, flushed and fed by hope, 
musing on the brilliant deception he had conceived, whose 
daring attempt has left his name unto the intellectual 
world as a marvel and a mystery.</p>
        <p>That a boy under twelve years of age should write a series 
of poems, imitating the style of the fifteenth century, 
and palm these poems off upon the world as the work of a 
monk, is indeed strange; and that these should become the 
object of interesting contemplation to the literary world, 
and should awaken inquiries, and exercise the talents of a 
Southey, a Bryant, a Miller, a Mathias, and others, savors 
more of romance
<pb id="brown160" n="160"/>
than reality. I had visited the room in a garret in High 
Holborn where this poor boy died; I had stood
over a grave in the burial-round of Shoe-Lane Workhouse, 
which was pointed out to me as the last resting-place 
of Chatterton; and now I was in the room where, it was 
alleged, he obtained the manuscripts that gave him 
such notoriety. We descended and viewed other portions 
of the church. The effect of the chancel, as seen 
behind the pictures, is very singular, and suggestive 
of many swelling thoughts. We look at the great east 
window—it is unadorned with its wonted painted glass; 
we look at the altar-screen beneath, on which the light 
of day again falls, and behold the injuries it has 
received at the hands of time. There is a dreary
mournfulness in the scene which fastens on the mind,
and is in unison with the time-worn mouldering 
fragments that are seen all around us. And this dreariness
is not removed by our tracing the destiny of man on the
storied pavements or on the graven brass, that still bears
upon its surface the names of those who obtained the
world's regard years back. This old pile is not only an
ornament to the city, but it stands a living monument to
the genius of its founder. Bristol has long sustained a
high position, as a place from which the American 
abolitionists have received substantial encouragement in
their arduous labors for the emancipation of the slaves 
of that land; and the writer of this received the best
evidence that in this respect the character of the people
had not been exaggerated, especially as regards the
<pb id="brown161" n="161"/>
“Clifton Ladies' Anti-Slavery Society.” From Bristol I paid 
a hasty visit to the Scotch capital.</p>
        <p>Edinburgh is the most picturesque of all the towns which 
I have visited since my arrival in the father-land. Its 
situation has been compared to that of Athens; but it is 
said that the modern Athens is superior to the ancient. I 
was deeply impressed with the idea that I had seen the 
most beautiful of cities, after beholding those fashionable 
resorts, Paris and Versailles. I have seen nothing in the 
way of public grounds to compare with the gardens of 
Versailles, or the Champs Elysees, at Paris; and as for 
statuary, the latter place is said to take the lead of the 
rest of the world.</p>
        <p>The general appearance of Edinburgh prepossesses one in its 
favor. The town, being built upon the brows of a large 
terrace, presents the most wonderful perspective. Its 
first appearance to a stranger, and the first impression, 
can scarcely be but favorable. In my first walk through 
the town I was struck with the difference in the appearance 
of the people from the English. But the difference between 
the Scotch and the Americans is very great. The 
cheerfulness depicted in the countenances of the people 
here, and their free-and-easy appearance, is very striking 
to a stranger. He who taught the sun to shine, the flowers 
to bloom, the birds to sing, and blesses us with rain, 
never intended that his creatures should look sad. There is 
a wide difference between the Americans and any other 
people which I have seen. The 
<pb id="brown162" n="162"/>
Scotch are healthy and robust, unlike the long-faced, 
sickly-looking Americans.</p>
        <p>While on our journey from London to Paris, to attend the 
Peace Congress, I could not but observe the marked 
difference between the English and American delegates. 
The former looked as if their pockets had been filled 
with sandwiches, made of good bread and roast beef; while 
the latter appeared as if their pockets had been filled 
with Holloway's pills and Mrs. Kidder's cordial.</p>
        <p>I breakfasted this morning in a room in which the poet 
Burns, as I was informed, had often sat. The conversation 
here turned upon Burns. The lady of the house pointed to a 
scrap of poetry which was in a frame hanging on the wall, 
written, as she said, by the poet, on hearing the people 
rejoicing in a church over the intelligence of a victory. 
I copied it, and will give it to you:
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“Ye hypocrites! are these your pranks, </l><l>To murder men and give God thanks? </l><l>For shame! give o'er, proceed no farther; </l><l>God won't accept your thanks for murder.”</l></lg></q></p>
        <p>The fact that I was in the room where Scotland's great
national poet had been a visitor caused me to feel that I
was on classic, if not hallowed ground. On returning
from our morning visit, we met a gentleman with a 
colored lady on each arm. C——remarked, in a very dry
manner, “If they were in Georgia, the slaveholders would 
make them walk in a more hurried gait than they do.” I 
said to my friend that, if he meant the 
<pb id="brown163" n="163"/>
pro-slavery prejudice would not suffer them to walk 
peaceably through the streets, they need go no further than
the pro-slavery cities of New York and Philadelphia. When 
walking through the streets, I amused myself by watching 
C——'s countenance; and, in doing so, imagined I saw 
the changes experienced by every fugitive slave in
his first month's residence in this country. A sixteen 
months' residence has not yet familiarized me with the 
change.</p>
        <p>I remained in Edinburgh a day or two, which gave me an 
opportunity of seeing some of the lions in the way of 
public buildings, &amp;c., in company with our friend C——.
I paid a visit to the Royal Institute, and inspected the 
very fine collection of paintings, statues, and other 
productions of art. The collection in the Institute is not 
to be compared to the British Museum at London, or the 
Louvre at Paris, but is probably the best in Scotland. 
Paintings from the hands of many of the masters, such as 
Sir A. Vandyke, Tiziano, Vercellio and Van Dellen, were 
hanging on the wall, and even the names of Rubens and 
Titian were attached to some of the finer specimens. Many 
of these represent some of the nobles and distinguished 
families of Rome, Athens, Greece, &amp;c. A beautiful one, 
representing a group of the Lomellini family of Genoa, 
seemed to attract the attention of most of the visitors.</p>
        <p>In visiting this place, we passed close by the monument of 
Sir Walter Scott. This is the most exquisite
<pb id="brown164" n="164"/>
thing of the kind that I have seen since coming to this 
country. It is said to be the finest monument in Europe. 
There sits the author of “Waverley,” with a book and 
pencil in hand, taking notes. A beautiful dog is seated by 
his side. Whether this is meant to represent his favorite 
dog, Camp, at whose death the poet shed so many tears, we 
were not informed; but I was of opinion that it might be 
the faithful Percy, whose monument stands in the grounds 
at Abbotsford. Scott was an admirer of the canine tribe. 
One may form a good idea of the appearance of this 
distinguished writer when living, by viewing this 
remarkable statue. The statue is very beautiful, but not 
equal to the one of Lord Byron, which was executed to be 
placed by the side of Johnson, Milton and Addison, in 
Poets' Corner, Westminster Abbey; but the vestry not 
allowing it a place there, it now stands in one of the 
colleges at Cambridge. While viewing the statue of Byron, 
I thought he, too, should have been represented with a dog 
by his side; for he, like Scott, was remarkably fond of 
dogs; so much so that he intended to have his favorite, 
Boatswain, interred by his side. </p>
        <p>We paid a short visit to the monuments of Burns and Allan 
Ramsay, and the renowned old Edinburgh Castle. The castle 
is now used as a barrack for infantry. It is accessible 
only from the High Street, and must have been impregnable 
before the discovery of gunpowder. In the wars with the 
English, it was twice taken by stratagem; once in a very 
daring manner, by climbing up the most
<pb id="brown165" n="165"/>
inaccessible part of the rock upon which it stands, and 
where a foe was least expected, and putting the guard to 
death; and at another time, by a party of soldiers 
disguising themselves as merchants, and obtaining 
admission inside the castle gates. They succeeded in 
preventing the gates from being closed until reinforced by 
a party of men under Sir Wm. Douglas, who soon overpowered 
the occupants of the castle.</p>
        <p>We could not resist the temptation hold out to see the 
palace of Holyrood. It was in this place that the 
beautiful but unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots resided for 
a number of years. On reaching the palace, we were met at 
the door by an elderly-looking woman, with a red face, 
garnished with a pair of second-hand curls, the whole 
covered with a cap having the widest border that I had 
seen for years. She was very kind in showing us
about the premises, especially as we were foreigners, no 
doubt expecting an extra fee for politeness. The most 
interesting of the many rooms in this ancient castle is 
the one which was occupied by the queen, and where her 
Italian favorite, Rizzio, was murdered.</p>
        <p>But by far the most interesting object which we visited 
while in Edinburgh was the house where the celebrated 
Reformer, John Knox, resided. It is a queer-looking old 
building, with a pulpit on the outside, and above the 
door are the nearly obliterated remains of the following 
inscription: “Lufe. God. Above. Al. And. your. Nichbour. 
As you. Self” This was probably traced under the immediate 
direction of the great Reformer.
<pb id="brown166" n="166"/>
Such an inscription put upon a house of worship at the
present day would be laughed at. I have given it to
you, punctuation and all, just as it stands.</p>
        <p>The general architecture of Edinburgh is very imposing, 
whether we regard the picturesque disorder of the 
buildings in the Old Town, or the symmetrical proportions 
of the streets and squares in the New. But on viewing 
this city, which has the reputation of being the finest 
in Europe, I was surprised to find that it had none of 
those sumptuous structures which, like St. Paul's, or 
Westminster Abbey, York Minster, and some other of the 
English provincial cathedrals, astonish the beholder 
alike by their magnitude and their architectural splendor. 
But in no city which I have visited in the kingdom is 
the general standard of excellence better maintained than 
in Edinburgh.</p>

        <p>I AM glad once more to breathe an atmosphere uncontaminated 
by the fumes and smoke of a city with its population of 
three hundred thousand inhabitants. In company with my 
friend C——, I left Glasgow on the afternoon of the 
23d inst., for Dundee, a beautiful town situated on the 
banks of the river Tay. One like my self, who has spent 
the best part of an eventful life in cities, and who 
prefers, as I do, a country to a town life, feels a 
greater degree of freedom when surrounded by forest trees, 
or country dwellings, and looking upon a clear sky, than 
when walking through the thoroughfares of a city, with 
its dense population, meeting every moment a new or 
strange face, which one has never seen before, and never 
expects to see again.</p>
        <p>Although I had met with one of the warmest public
receptions with which I have been greeted since my 
arrival in the country, and had had an opportunity of 
<pb id="brown168" n="168"/>
shaking hands with many noble friends of the slave, whose 
names I had often seen in print, yet I felt glad to see 
the tall chimneys and smoke of Glasgow receding in the 
distance, as our “iron-horse” was taking us with almost
lightning speed from the commercial capital of Scotland.</p>
        <p>The distance from Glasgow to Dundee is some seventy or 
eighty miles, and we passed through the finest country 
which I have seen in this portion of the queen's 
dominions. We passed through the old town of Stirling, 
which lies about thirty wiles distant from Glasgow, and
is a place much frequented by these who travel for 
pleasure. It is built on the brow of a hill, and the 
castle from which it most probably derived its name may 
be seen from a distance. Had it not been for a 
“professional” engagement the same evening at Dundee, I 
would most assuredly have halted to take a look at the 
old building.</p>
        <p>The castle is situated or built on an isolated rock, 
which seems as if nature had thrown it there for that
purpose. It was once the retreat of the Scottish kings, 
and famous for its historical associations. Here the
“Lady of the Lake,” with the magic ring, sought the 
monarch to intercede for her father; here James II. 
murdered the Earl of Douglas; here the beautiful but 
unfortunate Mary was made queen; and here John Knox, 
the Reformer, preached the coronation sermon of 
James IV. The Castle Hill rises from the valley of the
Forth, and makes an imposing and picturesque appearance. 
The windings of the noble river, till lost in the
<pb id="brown169" n="169"/>
distance, present pleasing contrasts, scarcely to be 
surpassed.</p>
        <p>The speed of our train, after passing Stirling, brought 
before us, in quick succession, a number of fine villas 
and farm-houses. Every spot seemed to have been arrayed 
by nature for the reception of the cottage of some happy 
family. During this ride we passed many sites where the 
lawns were made, the terraces defined and levelled, the 
groves tastefully clumped, the ancient trees, though 
small when compared to our great forest oaks, were 
beautifully sprinkled here and there, and in everything 
the labor of art seemed to have been anticipated by 
nature. Cincinnatus could not have selected a prettier 
situation for a farm than some which presented themselves 
during this delightful journey. At last we arrived at the 
place of our destination, where our friends were in waiting 
for us.</p>
        <p>As I have already forwarded to you a paper containing an 
account of the Dundee meeting, I shall leave you to judge 
from these reports the character of the demonstration. Yet 
I must mention a fact or two connected with our first 
evening's visit to this town. A few hours after our arrival 
in the place, we were called upon by a gentleman whose name 
is known wherever the English language is spoken—one 
whose name is on the tongue of every student and school-boy 
in this country and America, and what lives upon their lips 
will live and be loved forever.</p>
        <p>We were seated over a cup of strong tea, to revive our 
<pb id="brown170" n="170"/>
spirits for the evening, when our friend entered the room, 
accompanied by a gentleman, small in stature, and 
apparently seventy-five years of age, yet he appeared as 
active as one half that age. Feeling half drowsy from 
riding in the cold, and then the sudden change to a
warm fire, I was rather inclined not to move on the 
entrance of the stranger. But the name of Thomas Dick, 
LL.D., roused me in a moment from my lethargy; I could 
scarcely believe that I was in the presence of the 
“Christian Philosopher.” Dr. Dick is one of the men to 
whom the age is indebted. I never find myself in the 
presence of one to whom the world owes so much, without 
feeling a thrilling emotion, as if I were in the land 
of spirits. Dr. Dick had come to our lodgings to see 
and congratulate William and Ellen Craft upon their 
escape from the republican Christians of the United 
States; and as he pressed the hand of the “white slave,” 
and bid her “welcome to British soil,” I saw the silent 
tear stealing down the cheek of this man of genius. How 
I wished that the many slaveholders and pro-slavery 
professed Christians of America, who have read and 
pondered the philosophy of this man, could have been 
present! Thomas Dick is an abolitionist—one who is 
willing that the world should know that he hates the 
“peculiar institution.” At the meeting that evening, 
Dr. Dick was among the most prominent. But this was 
not the only distinguished man who took part on that 
occasion.</p>
        <p>Another great mind was on the platform, and entered
<pb id="brown171" n="171"/>
his solemn protest in a manner long to be remembered by 
those present. This was the Rev. George Gilfillan, well 
known as the author of the “Portraits of Literary Men.” 
Mr. Gilfillan is an energetic speaker, and would have been 
the lion of the evening, even if many others who are more 
distinguished as platform orators had been present. I 
think it was Napoleon who said that the enthusiasm of 
others abated his own. At any rate, the spirit with which 
each speaker entered upon his duty for the evening abated 
my own enthusiasm for the time being. The last day of our 
stay in Dundee, I paid a visit, by invitation, to Dr. 
Dick, at his residence in the little village of Broughty 
Ferry. We found the great astronomer in his parlor waiting 
for us. From the parlor we went to the new study, and here 
I felt more at ease, for I went to see the philosopher in 
his study, and not in his drawing-room. But even this 
room had too much the look of nicety to be an author's 
<hi rend="italics">sanctum;</hi> and I inquired and was soon informed by Mrs. Dick, 
that I should have a look at the “<hi rend="italics">old study.</hi>”</p>
        <p>During a sojourn of eighteen months in Great Britain, I 
have had the good fortune to meet with several distinguished 
literary characters, and have always managed, while at 
their places of abode, to see the table and favorite chair. 
William and Ellen Craft were seeing what they could see 
through a microscope, when Mrs. Dick returned to the room, 
and intimated that we could now see the old literary 
workshop. I followed, and was soon in a room about fifteen 
feet squire, with but one window,
<pb id="brown172" n="172"/>
which occupied one side of the room. The walls of the 
other three sides were lined with books, and many of these 
looked the very personification of age. I took my seat in 
the “<hi rend="italics">old arm-chair;</hi>” and here, thought I, is the place 
and the seat in which this distinguished man sat while 
weaving the radiant wreath of renown which now, in his old 
age, surrounds him, and whose labors will be more 
appreciated by future ages than the present.</p>
        <p>I took a farewell of the author of the “Solar System,” but 
not until I had taken a look through the great telescope 
in the observatory. This instrument, through which I tried 
to see the heavens, was not the one invented by Galileo, 
but an improvement upon the original. On leaving this 
learned man, he shook hands with us, and bade us “God 
speed” in our mission; and I left the philosopher, feeling 
I had not passed an hour more agreeably with a literary 
character since the hour which I spent with the poet 
Montgomery a few months since. And, by-the-by, there is a 
resemblance between the poet and the philosopher. In 
becoming acquainted with great men I have become a convert 
to the opinion that a big nose is an almost necessary 
appendage to the form of a man with a giant intellect. If 
those whom I have seen be a criterion, such is certainly 
the case. But I have spun out this too long, and must close.</p>

        <p>I CLOSED my last in the ancient town of Melrose, on the 
banks of the Tweed, and within a stone's throw of the 
celebrated ruins from which the town derives its name. 
The valley in which Melrose is situated, and the 
surrounding hills, together with the monastery, have so 
often been made a theme for the Scottish bards, that this 
has become the most interesting part of Scotland. Of the 
many gifted writers who have taken up the pen, none have 
done more to bring the Eildon Hills and Melrose Abbey 
into note than the author of “Waverley.” But who can read 
his writings without a regret that he should have so woven 
fact and fiction together that it is almost impossible 
to discriminate between the one and the other? </p>
        <p>We arrived at Melrose in the evening, and proceeded 
<pb id="brown174" n="174"/>
to the chapel where our meeting was to be held, and
where our friends, the Crafts, were warmly greeted. On
returning from the meeting we passed close by the ruins
of Melrose, and, very fortunately, it was a moonlight
night. There is considerable difference of opinion among 
the inhabitants of the place as regards the best time to 
view the abbey. The author of the “Lay of the Last 
Minstrel” says: 
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“If then wouldst view fair Melrose aright, </l><l>Go visit it by the pale moonlight; </l><l>For the gay beams of lightsome day </l><l>Gild but to flout the ruins gray.”</l></lg></q></p>
        <p>In consequence of this admonition, I was informed that 
many persons remain in town to see the ruins by moonlight. 
Aware that the moon did not send its rays upon the old 
building every night in the year, I asked the keeper what 
he did on dark nights. He replied that he had a large 
lantern, which he put upon the end of a long pole, and 
with this he succeeded in lighting up the ruins. This good 
man labored hard to convince me that his invention was 
nearly, if not quite as good, as nature's own moon. But 
having no need of an application of his invention to the 
abbey, I had no opportunity of judging of its effect. I 
thought, however, that he had made a moon to some purpose, 
when he informed me that some nights, with his pole and 
lantern, he earned his four or five shillings. Not being 
content with a view by “moonlight alone,” I was up the 
next morning before the sun,
<pb id="brown175" n="175"/>
and paid my respects to the abbey. I was too early for the 
keeper, and he handed me the key through the window, and I 
entered the ruins alone. It is one labyrinth of gigantic 
arches and dilapidated halls, the ivy growing and clinging 
wherever it can fasten its roots, and the whole as fine a 
picture of decay as imagination could create. This was the 
favorite resort of Sir Walter Scott, and furnished him much 
matter for the “Lay of the Last Minstrel.” He could not 
have selected a more fitting place for solitary thought 
than this ancient abode of monks and priests. In passing 
through the cloisters I could not but remark the carvings 
of leaves and flowers, wrought in stone in the most 
exquisite manner, looking as fresh as if they were just 
from the hands of the artist. The lapse of centuries seems 
not to have made any impression upon them, or changed their 
appearance in the least. I sat down among the ruins of the 
abbey. The ground about was piled up with magnificent 
fragments of stone, representing various texts of 
Scripture, and the quaint ideas of the priests and monks 
of that age. Scene after scene swept through my fancy as 
I looked upon the surrounding objects. I could almost 
imagine I saw the bearded monks going from hall to hall, 
and from cell to cell. In visiting these dark cells, the 
mind becomes oppressed by a sense of the utter helplessness 
of the victims who once passed over the thresholds and 
entered these religious prisons. There was no help or hope 
but in the will that ordered their fate. How painful it is 
to gaze upon these walls, and to
<pb id="brown176" n="176"/>
think how many tears were shed by their inmates, when this 
old monastery was in its glory! I ascended to the top of 
the ruin by a circuitous stairway, whose stone steps were 
worn deep from use by many who, like myself, had visited 
them to gratify a curiosity. From the top of the abbey I 
had a splendid view of the surrounding hills and the 
beautiful valley through which flow the Gala Water and 
Tweed. This is unquestionably the most splendid specimen 
of Gothic architectural ruin in Scotland. But any 
description of mine conveys but a poor idea to the fancy. 
To be realized, it must be seen.</p>
        <p>During the day, we paid a visit to Abbotsford, the splendid 
mansion of the late Sir Walter Scott, Bart. This beautiful 
seat is situated on the banks of the Tweed, just below its 
junction with the Gala Water. It is a dreary-looking spot, 
and the house from the opposite side of the river has the 
appearance of a small, low castle. In a single day's ride 
through England one may see half a dozen cottages larger 
than Abbotsford house. I was much disappointed in finding 
the premises undergoing repairs and alterations, and that 
all the trees between the house and the river had been cut 
down. This is to be regretted the more, because they were 
planted, nearly every one of them, by the same hand that 
waved its wand of enchantment over the world. The fountain
had been removed from where it had been placed by the
hands of the poet to the centre of the yard; and even a
small stone that had been placed over the favorite dog
<pb id="brown177" n="177"/>
“Percy” had been taken up and thrown among some loose 
stones. One visits Abbotsford because of the genius of 
the man that once presided over it. Everything connected 
with the great poet is of interest to his admirers,
and anything altered or removed tends to diminish that
interest. We entered the house, and were conducted
through the great hall, which is hung all round with
massive armor of all descriptions, and other memorial
of ancient times. The floor is of white and black marble.
In passing through the hall, we entered a narrow arched
room, stretching quite across the building, having a 
window at each end. This little or rather narrow room is 
filled with all kinds of armor, which is arranged with 
great taste. We were next shown into the dining-room, 
whose roof is of black oak, richly carved. In this room is 
a painting of the head of Queen Mary, in a charger, taken 
the day after the execution. Many other interesting 
portraits grace the walls of this room. But by far the 
finest apartment in the building is the drawing-room, with 
a lofty ceiling, and furnished with antique ebony 
furniture. After passing through the library, with its 
twenty thousand volumes, we found ourselves in the study, 
and I sat down in the same chair where once sat the poet: 
while before me was the table upon which were written the 
“Lady of the Lake,” “Waverley,” and other productions of 
this gifted writer. The clothes last worn by the poet were 
shown to us. There was the broad-skirted blue coat, with 
its large buttons, the plaid trousers, the heavy shoes, 
the black vest and white hat.
<pb id="brown178" n="178"/>
These were all in a glass case, and all looked the poet 
and novelist. But the inside of the buildings had 
undergone alterations, as well as the outside. In passing 
through the library, we saw a granddaughter of the poet. 
She was from London, and was only on a visit of a few 
days. She looked pale and dejected, and seemed as if she 
longed to leave this secluded spot and return to the 
metropolis. She looked for all the world like a hot-house 
plant. I don't think the Scotch could do better than to 
purchase Abbotsford, while it has some imprint of the 
great magician, and secure its preservation; for I am 
sure that, a hundred years hence, no place will be more 
frequently visited in Scotland than the home of the late 
Sir Walter Scott. After sauntering three hours about the 
premises, I left, but not without feeling that I had been 
well paid for my trouble in visiting Abbotsford.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon of the same day, in company with the 
Crafts, I took a drive to Dryburgh Abbey. It is a ruin of 
little interest, except as being the burial-place of 
Scott. The poet lies buried in St. Mary's Aisle. His grave 
is in the left transept of the cross, and close to where 
the high altar formerly stood. Sir Walter Scott chose his 
own grave, and he could not have selected a sunnier spot if 
he had roamed the wide world over. A shaded window breaks 
the sun as it falls upon his grave. The ivy is creeping 
and clinging wherever it can, as if it would shelter the 
poet's grave from the weather. The author lies between his 
wife and eldest son, and there is only room enough for 
one grave more, and the son's wife has the choice of 
being buried here.</p>
        <pb id="brown179" n="179"/>
        <p>The four o'clock train took us to Hawick; and after a 
pleasant visit in this place, and the people registering 
their names against American slavery, and the Fugitive 
Bill in particular, we set out for Carlisle, passing 
through the antique town of Langholm. After leaving the 
latter place, we had to travel by coach. But no matter 
how one travels here, he travels at a more rapid rate than 
in America. The distance from Langholm to Carlisle, twenty 
miles, occupied only two and a half hours in the journey. 
It was a cold day, and I had to ride on the outside, as 
the inside had been taken up. We changed horses and took 
in and put out passengers with a rapidity which seems 
almost incredible. The road was as smooth as could be 
imagined.</p>
        <p>We bid farewell to Scotland, as we reached the little town 
of Gretna Green. This town, being on the line between 
England and Scotland, is noted as the place where a little 
cross-eyed, red-faced blacksmith, by the name of Priestly, 
first set up his own altar to Hymen, and married all who 
came to him, without regard to rank or station, and at 
prices to suit all. It was worth a ride through this part 
of the country, if for no other purpose than to see the 
town where more clandestine marriages have taken place 
than in any other part of the world. A ride of eight or 
nine miles brought us in sight of the Eden, winding its 
way slowly through a beautiful valley, with farms on 
either side, covered with sheep and cattle. Four very 
tall chimneys, sending forth dense columns of black smoke, 
announced to us that we were
<pb id="brown180" n="180"/>
near Carlisle. I was really glad of this, for Ulysses 
was never more tired of the shores of Ilion than I of the 
top of that coach.</p>
        <p>We remained over night at Carlisle, partaking of the 
hospitality of the prince of bakers, and left the next 
day for the lakes, where we had a standing invitation to 
pay a visit to a distinguished literary lady. A cold ride 
of about fifty miles brought us to the foot of Lake 
Windermere, a beautiful sheet of water, surrounded by 
mountains that seemed to vie with each other which should 
approach nearest the sky. The margin of the lake is carved 
out and built up into terrace above terrace, until the 
slopes and windings are lost in the snow-capped peaks of 
the mountains. It is not surprising that such men as 
Southey, Coleridge, Wordsworth, and others, resorted to 
this region for inspiration. After a coach ride of five
miles (passing on our journey the “Dove's Nest,” home of 
the late Mrs. Hemans), we were put down at the door of 
the Salutation Hotel, Ambleside, and a few minutes after 
found ourselves under the roof of the authoress of 
“Society in America.” I know not how it is with others, 
but, for my own part, I always form an opinion of the 
appearance of an author whose writings I am at all 
familiar with, or a statesman whose speeches I have read. 
I had pictured in my own mind a tall, stately-looking 
lady of about sixty years, as the authoress of “Travels 
in the East;” and for once I was right, with the single 
exception that I had added on too many years by twelve. 
The evening was spent in talking about the
<pb id="brown181" n="181"/>
United States; and William Craft had to go through the 
narrative of his escape from slavery. When I retired for 
the night, I found it almost impossible to sleep. The idea 
that I was under the roof of the authoress of “The Hour 
and the Man,” and that I was on the banks of the sweetest 
lake in Great Britain, within half a mile of the residence 
of the late poet Wordsworth, drove sleep from my pillow. 
But I must leave an account of my visit to the Lakes for 
a future chapter.</p>
        <p>When I look around and see the happiness here, even among 
the poorer classes, and that too in a country where the 
soil is not at all to be compared with our own, I mourn 
for our down-trodden countrymen, who are plundered, 
oppressed and made chattels of, to enable an ostentatious 
aristocracy to vie with each other in splendid extravagance.</p>

        <p>MY last left me under the hospitable roof of Harriet 
Martineau. I had long had an invitation to visit this 
distinguished friend of our race, and as the invitation 
was renewed during my tour through the north, I did not 
feel disposed to decline it, and thereby lose so favorable 
an opportunity of meeting with one who had written so much 
in behalf of the oppressed of our land. About a mile from 
the head of Lake Windermere, and immediately under 
Wonsfell, and encircled by mountains on all sides except 
the south-west, lies the picturesque little town of 
Ambleside; and the brightest spot in the place is “The 
Knoll,” the residence of Miss Martineau.</p>
        <p>We reached “The Knoll” a little after night-fall, and a 
cordial shake of the hand by Miss M., who was waiting 
for us, trumpet in hand, soon assured us that we had met 
with a warm friend.</p>
        <pb id="brown183" n="183"/>
        <p>It is not my intention to lay open the scenes of domestic 
life at “The Knoll,” nor to describe the social parties 
of which my friends and I were partakers during our 
sojourn within the hospitable walls of this distinguished 
writer; but the name of Miss M. is so intimately 
connected with the Anti-slavery movement by her early 
writings, and those have been so much admired by the friends
of the slave in the United States, that I deem it not at 
all out of place for me to give my readers some idea of 
the authoress of “Political Economy,” “Travels in the 
East,” “The Hour and the Man,” &amp;c.</p>
        <p>The dwelling is a cottage of moderate size, built after
Miss M.'s own plan, upon a rise of land, from which it 
derives the name of “The Knoll.” The library is the 
largest room in the building, and upon the walls of it
were hung some beautiful engravings and a continental
map. On a long table, which occupied the centre of the 
room, were the busts of Shakspeare, Newton, Milton, and 
a few other literary characters of the past. One side of 
the room was taken up with a large case, filled with a 
choice collection of books; and everything indicated that 
it was the home of genius and of taste.</p>
        <p>The room usually occupied by Miss M., and where we found 
her on the evening of our arrival, is rather small, and 
lighted by two large windows. The walls of this room 
were also decorated with prints and pictures, and on the 
mantel-shelf were some models in terra cotta of Italian 
groups. On a circular table lay casts, medallions, and 
some very choice water-color drawings. Under
<pb id="brown184" n="184"/>
the south window stood a small table covered with 
newly-opened letters, a portfolio, and several new books, 
with here and there a page turned down, and one with a 
paperknife between its leaves, as if it had only been 
half read. I took up the last-mentioned, and it proved 
to be the “Life and Poetry of Hartley Coleridge,” son of 
S. T. Coleridge. It was just from the press, and had, a 
day or two before, been forwarded to her by the publisher. 
Miss M. is very deaf, and always carries in her left hand 
a trumpet; and I was not a little surprised on learning 
from her that she had never enjoyed the sense of smell, 
and only on one occasion the sense of taste, and that for 
a single moment. Miss M. is loved with a sort of idolatry 
by the people of Ambleside, and especially the poor, to 
whom she gives a course of lectures every winter 
gratuitously. She finished her last course the day before 
our arrival. She was much pleased with Ellen Craft, and 
appeared delighted with the story of herself and 
husband's escape from slavery, as related by the latter, 
during the recital of which I several times saw the silent 
tear stealing down her cheek, and which she tried in vain 
to hide from us.</p>
        <p>When Craft had finished, she exclaimed, “I would that 
every woman in the British empire could hear that tale 
as I have, so that they might know how their own sex was 
treated in that boasted land of liberty.” It seems 
strange to the people of this country, that one so white 
and so ladylike as Mrs. Craft should have been a
<pb id="brown185" n="185"/>
slave, and forced to leave the land of her nativity and 
seek an asylum in a foreign country.</p>
        <p>The morning after our arrival I took a stroll by a circuitous 
pathway to the top of Loughrigg Fell. At the foot of the 
mount I met a peasant, who very kindly offered to lend me 
his donkey, upon which to ascend the mountain. Never 
having been upon the back of one of these long-eared 
animals, I felt some hesitation about trusting myself upon 
so diminutive looking a creature. But, being assured that 
if I would only resign myself to his care, and let him have 
his own way, I would be perfectly safe, I mounted, and off 
we set. We had, however, scarcely gone fifty rods, when, 
in passing over a narrow part of the path and overlooking 
a deep chasm, one of the hind feet of the donkey slipped, 
and with an involuntary shudder I shut my eyes to meet my 
expected doom; but, fortunately, the little fellow gained 
his foothold, and in all probability saved us both from a 
premature death. After we had passed over this dangerous 
place I dismounted; and, as soon as my feet had once more 
gained terra firma, I resolved that I would never again 
yield my own judgment to that of any one, not even to a 
donkey.</p>
        <p>It seems as if nature had amused herself in throwing 
these mountains together. From the top of Loughrigg
Fell the eye loses its power in gazing upon the objects
below. On our left lay Rydal Mount, the beautiful seat 
of the late poet Wordsworth; while to the right, and 
away in the dim distance, almost hidden by the native
<pb id="brown186" n="186"/>
trees, was the cottage where once resided Mrs. Hemans. And 
below us lay Windermere, looking more like a river than a 
lake, and which, if placed by the side of our own Ontario, 
Erie or Huron, would be lost in the fog. But here it looks 
beautiful in the extreme, surrounded as it is by a range 
of mountains that have no parallel in the United States 
for beauty. Amid a sun of uncommon splendor, dazzling the 
eye with the reflection upon the water below, we descended 
into the valley, and I was soon again seated by the 
fireside of our hospitable hostess. In the afternoon of 
the same day we took a drive to the “Dove's Nest,” the 
home of the late Mrs. Hemans.</p>
        <p>We did not see the inside of the house, on account of 
its being occupied by a very eccentric man, who will not 
permit a woman to enter the house; and it is said that he 
has been known to run when a female had unconsciously 
intruded herself upon his premises. As our company was 
in part composed of ladies, we had to share their fate, 
and therefore were prevented from seeing the interior of 
the “Dove's Nest.” The exhibitor of such a man would be 
almost sure of a prize at the Great Exhibition.</p>
        <p>At the head of Grassmere Lake, and surrounded by a few 
cottages, stands an old, gray, antique-looking parish 
church, venerable with the lapse of centuries, and the 
walls partly covered with ivy, and in the rear of which 
is the parish burial-ground. After leaving the “Dove's 
Nest,” and having a pleasant ride over the hills and 
between the mountains, and just as the sun was disappearing
<pb id="brown187" n="187"/>
behind them, we arrived at the gate of Grassmere Church; 
and, alighting and following Miss M., we soon found 
ourselves standing over a grave, marked by a single 
stone, and that, too, very plain, with a name deeply cut. 
This announced to us that we were standing over the grave 
of William Wordsworth. He chose his own grave, and often 
visited the spot before his death. He lies in the most 
sequestered spot in the whole grounds; and the simplicity 
and beauty of the place were enough to make one in love 
with it, to be laid so far from the bustle of the world, 
and in so sweet a place. The more one becomes acquainted 
with the literature of the Old World, the more he must 
love her poets. Among the teachers of men, none are more 
worthy of study than the poets; and, as teachers, they 
should receive far more credit than is yielded to them. 
No one can look back upon the lives of Dante, Shakspeare, 
Milton, Goethe, Cowper, and many others that we might 
name, without being reminded of the sacrifices which they 
made for mankind, and which were not appreciated until 
long after their deaths. We need look no further than our 
own country to find men and women wielding the pen 
practically and powerfully for the right. It is 
acknowledged on all hands, in this country, that England 
has the greatest dead poets, and America the greatest 
living ones. The poet and the true Christian have alike a 
hidden life. Worship is the vital element of each. Poetry 
has in it that kind of utility which good men find in 
their Bible, rather than such convenience as bad men 
often profess to draw from it.
<pb id="brown188" n="188"/>
It ennobles the sentiments, enlarges the affections, 
kindles the imagination, and gives to us the enjoyment of 
a life in the past, and in the future, as well as in the 
present. Under its light and warmth, we wake from our 
torpidity and coldness, to a sense of our capabilities. 
This impulse once given, a great object is gained. 
Schiller has truly said, “Poetry can be to a man what love 
is to a hero. It can neither counsel him, nor smite him, 
nor perform any labor for him; but it can bring him up to 
be a hero, can summon him to deeds, and arm him with 
strength for all he ought to be.” I have often read 
with pleasure the sweet poetry of our own Whitfield, of 
Buffalo, which has appeared from time to time in the 
columns of the newspapers. I have always felt ashamed of 
the fact that he should be compelled to wield the razor 
instead of the pen for a living. Meaner poets than James M. 
Whitfield are now living by their compositions; and were 
he a white man he would occupy a different position.</p>
        <p>Near the grave of Wordsworth is that of Hartley Coleridge. 
This name must be lifted up as a beacon, with all its 
pleasant and interesting associations; it must be added 
to the list in which some names of brighter fame are 
written—Burns, Byron, Campbell, and others their 
compeers. They had all the rich endowment of genius, and 
might, in achieving fame for themselves, have gained 
glory for God, and great good for man. But they looked 
“upon the wine when it was red,” and gave life and fame, 
and their precious gifts, and God's blessing, for its 
false and ruinous joys. We would not
<pb id="brown189" n="189"/>
drag forth their names that we may gloat over their 
infirmities. We pity them for their sad fall. We 
acknowledge the strength of their temptations, and, 
walking backwards, would throw a mantle over their 
frailties. But these men are needed, also, as warnings. 
The moral world must have its lighthouses. Thousands of 
young men are running down upon the same rocks on which 
they were cast away. If the light of their genius has 
made them conspicuous, let us then use their conspicuity, 
and throw a ray from them, as from a beacon, far out 
upon the dim and perilous sea.</p>
        <p>Hartley Coleridge was the eldest son of Samuel Taylor
Coleridge, poet and metaphysician. He had some of his 
father's gifts, particularly his captivating 
conversational power, and his propensity for novel and 
profound speculation. He had also his father's infirmity 
of purpose. In the case of the son, the reason, as the 
world is now informed in a biography written by his 
brother, was that he early became the slave of 
intemperate habits, from which no aspirations of his 
own heart, no struggles with the enslaving appetite, and 
no efforts of sympathizing and sorrowful friends, could 
ever deliver him. He gained a fellowship in Oriel 
College, Oxford, and forfeited it in consequence of 
these habits. He then cast himself, as a literary 
adventurer, into the wild vortex of London life; failed 
sadly in all his projects; drank deep of the treacherous 
wine-cup, often to his own shame and the chagrin of his 
friends, from whom he would sometimes hide himself in 
places where restraint was unknown
<pb id="brown190" n="190"/>
and shame forgotten, that he might be delivered from 
their reproachful pity. In the end, he betook himself to 
a cottage near Grassmere, and where, on the 6th of 
January, 1819, he died, not, we trust, without penitence 
and faith in the Redeemer of guilty and wretched men.</p>
        <p>Hartley Coleridge tells us, in one of his confessions, 
that his first resort to wine was for the purpose of 
seeking relief from the sting of defeated ambition. This 
temptation was necessarily brief in its duration; for 
time would gradually extract this sting from his sensitive
mind and heart. This, therefore, was not the doorway of 
the path which led him down to the gulf. The “wine parties”
of Oxford were the scenes in which Hartley Coleridge was 
betrayed and lost. We have but a momentary glimpse of 
these things in the biography; but that glimpse is 
sufficient. It reveals to us what in popular language is 
called a gay scene, but which to us, and in reality, is 
sombre as death. In the midst of it there sits a 
bright-eyed, enthusiastic, impetuous young man, heated 
with repeated draughts of wine, urged by his 
fellow-revellers to drink deeper, yielding readily to
their solicitations, and pouring forth all the while a
stream of continuous and sparkling discourse, which 
fascinated his companions by its wit, its facility and its
beauty. Alas! how many of those companions, it may
be, are with him in graves where men can only weep and
be silent!</p>
        <p>It has often been said, and with much truth, that there is 
no more dangerous gift for a young man than
<pb id="brown191" n="191"/>
to be able to sing a good song. It is equally dangerous, 
we think, to be known as a good talker. The gift of rapid, 
brilliant, mirth-moving speech, is a perilous possession. 
The dullards, for whose amusement this gift is so often 
invoked, know well that to ply its possessor with wine is 
the readiest way to bring out its power. But in the end the 
wine destroys the intellect, and the man of wit degenerates 
into a buffoon, and dies a drunkard. Such is the brief life 
and history of many a young man, who, behind the 
stained-glass windows of the fashionable <hi rend="italics">restaurant</hi>, or in 
the mirrored and cushioned rooms of the club-house, was 
hailed as the “prince of good fellows,” and the rarest of 
wits. The laughing applauders pass on, each in his own 
way, and he who made them sport is left to struggle in 
solitude with the enemy they have helped to fasten upon 
him. Let every young man who longs for those gifts, and 
envies their possessors, remember “poor Hartley 
Coleridge.” Let them be warned by the fate of one who was 
caught in the toils they are weaving around themselves, 
and perished therein, leaving behind him the record of a 
life of unfulfilled purposes, and of great departures from 
the path of duty and peace.</p>
        <p>After remaining a short time, and reading the epitaphs
of the departed, we again returned to “The Knoll.”
Nothing can be more imposing than the beauty of English 
park scenery, and especially in the vicinity of the Lakes. 
Magnificent lawns that extend like sheets of vivid green, 
with here and there a sprinkling of fine
<pb id="brown192" n="192"/>
trees, heaping up rich piles of foliage, and then the 
forest with the hare, the deer, and the rabbit, “bounding 
away to the covert, or the pheasant suddenly bursting upon 
the wing—the artificial stream, the brook taught to 
wind in natural meanderings, or expand into the glassy 
lake, with the yellow leaf sleeping upon its bright 
waters, and occasionally a rustic temple or sylvan statue 
grown green and dark with age,” give an air of sanctity 
and picturesque beauty to English scenery that is unknown 
in the United States. The very laborer with his thatched 
cottage and narrow slip of ground-plot before the door, 
the little flower-bed, the woodbine trimmed against the 
wall, and hanging its blossoms about the windows, and the 
peasant seen trudging home at nightfall with the avails of 
the toil of the day upon his back—all this tells us of 
the happiness both of rich and poor in this country. And 
yet there are those who would have the world believe that 
the laborer of England is in a far worse condition than the 
slaves of America. Such persons know nothing of the real 
condition of the working classes of this country. At any 
rate, the poor here, as well as the rich, are upon a level, 
as far as the laws of the country are concerned. The more 
one becomes acquainted with the English people, the more 
one has to admire them. They are so different from the 
people of our own country. Hospitality, frankness and 
good humor, are always to be found in an Englishman. After 
a ramble of three days about the Lakes, we mounted the 
coach, bidding Miss Martineau farewell, and quitted the 
lake district.</p>

        <p>PRESUMING that you will expect from me some account of 
the great World's Fair, I take my pen to give you my own 
impressions, although I am afraid that anything which I 
may say about this “lion of the day” will fall far short 
of a description. On Monday last, I quitted my lodgings at 
an early hour, and started for the Crystal Palace. The day 
was fine, such as we seldom experience in London, with a 
clear sky, and invigorating air, whose vitality was as 
rousing to the spirits as a blast from the “horn of 
Astolpho.” Although it was not yet ten o'clock when I 
entered Piccadilly, every omnibus was full, inside and 
out, and the street was lined with one living stream, as 
far as the eye could reach, all wending their way to the 
“Glass House.” No metropolis in the world presents such 
facilities as London for the reception of the Great 
Exhibition now collected within its walls. Throughout its 
myriads of veins the stream of industry and toil pulses 
with sleepless energy. Every one seems
<pb id="brown194" n="194"/>
to feel that this great capital of the world is the 
fittest place wherein they might offer homage to the 
dignity of toil. I had already begun to feel fatigued by 
my pedestrian excursions as I passed “Apsley House,” the 
residence of the Duke of Wellington, and emerged into 
Hyde Park.</p>
        <p>I had hoped that on getting into the Park I would be
out of the crowd that seemed to press so heavily in the
street. But in this I was mistaken. I here found my
self surrounded by and moving with an overwhelming
mass, such as I had never before witnessed. And, away
in the distance, I beheld a dense crowd, and above every
other object was seen the lofty summit of the Crystal
Palace. The drive in the Park was lined with 
princely-looking vehicles of every description. The drivers 
in their bright red and gold uniforms, the pages and footmen
in their blue trousers and white silk stockings, and the
horses dressed up in their neat, silver-mounted harness,
made the scene altogether one of great splendor. I was
soon at the door, paid my shilling, and entered the
building at the south end of the transept. For the first
ten or twenty minutes, I was so lost in astonishment,
and absorbed in pleasing wonder, that I could do nothing
but gaze up and down the vista of the noble building.
The Crystal Palace resembles in some respects the 
interior of the cathedrals of this country. One long avenue
from east to west is intercepted by a transept, which
divides the building into two nearly equal parts. This
is the greatest building the world ever saw, before which
<pb id="brown195" n="195"/>
the Pyramids of Egypt, and the Colossus of Rhodes must
hide their diminished heads. The palace was not full at
any time during the day, there being only sixty-four
thousand persons present. Those who love to study the
human countenance in all its infinite varieties can find
ample scope for the indulgence of their taste, by a visit
to the World's Fair. All countries are there represented—
Europeans, Asiatics, Americans and Africans,
with their numerous subdivisions. Even the exclusive
Chinese, with his hair braided, and hanging down his
back, has left the land of his nativity, and is seen making
long strides through the Crystal Palace, in his 
wooden-bottomed shoes. Of all places of curious costumes 
and different fashions, none has ever yet presented such a 
variety as this Exhibition. No dress is too absurd to be 
worn in this place.</p>
        <p>There is a great deal of freedom in the Exhibition. The 
servant who walks behind his mistress through the Park 
feels that he can crowd against her in the Exhibition. The 
queen and the day laborer, the prince and the merchant, the 
peer and the pauper, the Celt and the Saxon, the Greek and 
the Frank, the Hebrew and the Russ, all meet here upon 
terms of perfect equality. This amalgamation of rank, this 
kindly blending of interests, and forgetfulness of the cold 
formalities of ranks and grades, cannot but be attended with 
the very best results. I was pleased to see such a goodly 
sprinkling of my own countrymen in the Exhibition—I 
mean colored men and women—well-dressed, and moving 
about with
<pb id="brown196" n="196"/>
their fairer brethren. This, some of our pro-slavery 
Americans did not seem to relish very well. There was no 
help for it. As I walked through the American part of the 
Crystal Palace some of our Virginia neighbors eyed me 
closely and with jealous looks, especially as an English 
lady was leaning on my arm. But their sneering looks did 
not disturb me in the least. I remained the longer in their 
department, and criticized the bad appearance of their 
goods the more. Indeed, the Americans, as far as appearance 
goes, are behind every other country in the Exhibition. The 
“Greek Slave” is the only production of art which the 
United States has sent. And it would have been more to 
their credit had they kept that at home. In so vast a place 
as the Great Exhibition one scarcely knows what to visit 
first, or what to look upon last. After wandering about 
through the building for five hours, I sat down in one of 
the galleries and looked at the fine marble statue of 
Virginius, with the knife in his hand and about to take the 
life of his beloved and beautiful daughter, to save her 
from the hands of Appius Claudius. The admirer of genius 
will linger for hours among the great variety of statues 
in the long avenue. Large statues of Lords Eldon and 
Stowell, carved out of solid marble, each weighing above 
twenty tons, are among the most gigantic in the building. </p>
        <p>I was sitting with my four hundred paged guide-book before 
me, and looking down upon the moving mass, when my attention 
was called to a small group of gentlemen
<pb id="brown197" n="197"/>
standing near the statue of Shakspeare, one of whom wore a 
white coat and hat, and had flaxen hair, and trousers 
rather short in the legs. The lady by my side, and who had 
called my attention to the group, asked if I could tell 
what country this odd-looking gentleman was from. Not 
wishing to run the risk of a mistake, I was about declining 
to venture an opinion, when the reflection of the sun 
against a mirror, on the opposite side, threw a brilliant 
light upon the group, and especially on the face of the 
gentleman in the white coat, and I immediately recognized 
under the brim of the white hat the features of Horace 
Greeley, Esq., of the New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi>. His general 
appearance was as much out of the English style as that of 
the Turk whom I had seen but a moment before, in his 
bag-like trousers, shuffling along in his slippers. But 
oddness in dress is one of the characteristics of the Great 
Exhibition. </p>
        <p>Among the many things in the Crystal Palace, there are some 
which receive greater attention than others, around which 
may always be seen large groups of the visitors. The first 
of these is the Koh-i-noor, the “Mountain of Light.” This 
is the largest and most valuable diamond in the world, said 
to be worth two million pounds sterling. It is indeed a 
great source of attraction to those who go to the Exhibition 
for the first time, but it is doubtful whether it obtains 
such admiration afterwards. We saw more than one spectator 
turn away with the idea that, after all, it was only a piece 
of glass. 
<pb id="brown198" n="198"/>
After some jamming, I got a look at the precious jewel; and 
although in a brass-grated cage strong, enough to hold a 
lion, I found it to be no larger than the third of a hen's 
egg. Two policemen remain by its side day and night.</p>
        <p>The finest thing in the Exhibition is the “Veiled Vestal,” 
a statue of a woman carved in marble, with a veil over her 
face, and so neatly done that it looks as if it had been 
thrown over after it was finished. The Exhibition presents 
many things which appeal to the eye and touch the heart, 
and altogether it is so decorated and furnished as to 
excite the dullest mind, and satisfy the most fastidious.</p>
        <p>England has contributed the most useful and substantial 
articles; France, the most beautiful; while Russia, Turkey 
and the West Indies, seem to vie with each other in 
richness. China and Persia are not behind. Austria has also 
contributed a rich and beautiful stock. Sweden, Norway, 
Denmark, and the smaller states of Europe, have all tried 
to outdo themselves in sending goods to the World's Fair. 
In machinery, England has no competitor. In art, France is 
almost alone in the Exhibition, setting aside England.</p>
        <p>In natural productions and provisions, America stands alone 
in her glory. There lies her pile of canvassed hams; whether 
they were wood or real, we could not tell. There are her 
barrels of salt beef and pork, her beautiful white lard, 
her Indian-corn and corn-meal, her rice and tobacco, her 
beef-tongues, dried peas, and a few
<pb id="brown199" n="199"/>
bags of cotton. The contributors from the United States 
seemed to have forgotten that this was an exhibition of 
art, or they most certainly would not have sent provisions. 
But the United States takes the lead in the contributions, 
as no other country has sent in provisions. The finest 
thing contributed by our countrymen is a large piece of 
silk with an eagle painted upon it, surrounded by stars 
and stripes.</p>
        <p>After remaining more than five hours in the great temple, 
I turned my back upon the richly-laden stalls, and left the 
Crystal Palace. On my return home I was more fortunate than 
in the morning, inasmuch as I found a seat for my friend 
and myself in an omnibus. And even my ride in the close 
omnibus was not without interest. For I had scarcely taken 
my seat, when my friend, who was seated opposite me, with 
looks and gesture informed me that we were in the presence 
of some distinguished person. I eyed the countenances of 
the different persons, but in vain, to see if I could find 
any one who by his appearance showed signs of superiority 
over his fellow-passengers. I had given up the hope of 
selecting the person of note, when another look from my 
friend directed my attention to a gentleman seated in the 
corner of the omnibus. He was a tall man, with 
strongly-marked features, hair dark and coarse. There was a 
slight stoop of the shoulder—that bend which is almost 
always a characteristic of studious men. But he wore upon 
his countenance a forbidding and disdainful frown, that 
seemed to tell one that he thought himself better
<pb id="brown200" n="200"/>
than those about him. His dress did not indicate a man of 
high rank; and had we been in America, I would have taken 
him for an Ohio farmer.</p>
        <p>While I was scanning the features and general appearance of 
the gentleman, the omnibus stopped and put down three or 
four of the passengers, which gave me an opportunity of 
getting a seat by the side of my friend, who, in a low 
whisper, informed me that the gentleman whom I bad been 
eying so closely was no less a person than Thomas Carlyle. 
I had read his “Hero-worship,” and “Past and Present,” and 
had formed a high opinion of his literary abilities. But 
his recent attack upon the emancipated people of the West 
Indies, and his laborious article in favor of the 
reëstablishment of the lash and slavery, had created in my 
mind a dislike for the man, and I almost regretted that we 
were in the same omnibus. In some things Mr. Carlyle is 
right: but in many he is entirely wrong. As a writer, Mr. 
Carlyle is often monotonous and extravagant. He does not 
exhibit a new view of nature, or raise insignificant objects 
into importance; but generally takes commonplace thoughts 
and events, and tries to express them in stronger and 
statelier language than others. He holds no communion with 
his kind, but stands alone, without mate or fellow. He is 
like a solitary peak, all access to which is cut off. He 
exists not by sympathy, but by antipathy. Mr. Carlyle 
seems chiefly to try how he shall display his own powers, 
and astonish mankind, by starting new trains of 
speculation, or by expressing old ones
<pb id="brown201" n="201"/>
so as not to be understood. He cares little what he says, so 
as he can say it differently from others. To read his works, 
is one thing; to understand them, is another. If any one 
thinks that I exaggerate, let him sit for an hour over 
“Sartor Resartus,” and if he does not rise from its pages, 
place his three or four dictionaries on the shelf, and say 
I am right, I promise never again to say a word against 
Thomas Carlyle. He writes one page in favor of reform, and 
ten against it. He would hang all prisoners to get rid of 
them; yet the inmates of the prisons and “workhouses are 
better off than the poor.” His heart is with the poor; yet 
the blacks of the West Indies should be taught that if they 
will not raise sugar and cotton by their own free will, 
“Quashy should have the whip applied to him.” He frowns 
upon the reformatory speakers upon the boards of Exeter 
Hall; yet he is the prince of reformers. He hates heroes 
and assassins; yet Cromwell was an angel, and Charlotte 
Corday a saint. He scorns everything, and seems to be tired 
of what he is by nature, and tries to be what he is not.</p>

        <p>THE past six weeks have been of a stirring nature in this 
great metropolis. It commenced with the Peace Congress, the 
proceedings of which have long since reached you. And 
although that event has passed off, it may not be out of 
place here to venture a remark or two upon its deliberations.</p>
        <p>A meeting upon the subject of peace, with the support of 
the monied and influential men who rally around the peace 
standard, could scarcely have been held in Exeter Hall 
without creating some sensation. From all parts of the 
world flocked delegates to this practical protest against 
war. And among those who took part in the proceedings were 
many men whose names alone would, even on ordinary 
occasions, have filled the great hall. The speakers were 
chosen from among the representatives of the various 
countries, without regard to dialect
<pb id="brown203" n="203"/>
or complexion; and the only fault which seemed to be found 
with the committee's arrangement was, that in their desire 
to get foreigners and Londoners, they forgot the country 
delegates, so that none of the large provincial towns were 
at all represented in the Congress, so far as speaking was 
concerned. Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and all the 
important towns in Scotland and Ireland, were silenced in 
the great meeting. I need not say that this was an oversight 
of the committee, and one, too, that has done some injury. 
Such men as the able chairman of the late Anti-Corn-Law 
League cannot be forgotten in such a meeting, without giving 
offence to those who sent him, especially when the committee 
brought forward, day after day, the same speakers, chosen 
from amongst the metropolitan delegation. However, the 
meeting was a glorious one, and will long be remembered 
with delight as a step onward in the cause of peace. 
Burritt's Brotherhood Bazaar followed close upon the heels 
of the Peace Congress; and this had scarcely closed, when 
that ever-memorable meeting of the American fugitive slaves 
took place in the Hall of Commerce.</p>
        <p>The temperance people made the next reformatory move. This 
meeting took place in Exeter Hall, and was made up of 
delegates from the various towns in the kingdom. They had 
come from the North, East, West and South. There was the 
quick-spoken son of the Emerald Isle, with his pledge 
suspended from his neck; there, too, the Scot, speaking his 
broad dialect; also the
<pb id="brown204" n="204"/>
representatives from the provincial towns of England and 
Wales, who seemed to speak anything but good English.</p>
        <p>The day after the meeting had closed in Exeter Hall, the 
country societies, together with those of the metropolis, 
assembled in Hyde Park, and then walked to the Crystal 
Palace. Their number while going to the Exhibition was 
variously estimated at from fifteen thousand to twenty 
thousand, and was said to have been the largest gathering 
of teetotallers ever assembled in London. They consisted 
chiefly of the working classes, their wives and children—
clean, well-dressed and apparently happy: their looks 
indicating in every way those orderly habits which, beyond 
question, distinguish the devotees of that cause above the 
common laborers of this country. On arriving at the 
Exhibition, they soon distributed themselves among the 
departments, to revel in its various wonders, eating their 
own lunch, and drinking from the Crystal Fountain.</p>
        <p>And, now I am at the world's wonder, I will remain bore 
until I finish this sheet. I have spent fifteen days in the 
Exhibition, and have conversed with those who have spent 
double that number amongst its beauties, and the general 
opinion appears to be that six months would not be too long 
to remain within its walls to enable one to examine its 
laden stalls. Many persons make the Crystal Palace their 
home, with the exception of night. I have seen them come in 
the morning, visit the dressing-room, then go to the 
refreshment-room, and sit down
<pb id="brown205" n="205"/>
to breakfast as if they been at their hotel. Dinner and tea 
would be taken in turn.</p>
        <p>The Crystal Fountain is the great place of meeting in the 
Exhibition. There you may see husbands looking for lost 
wives, wives for stolen husbands, mothers for their lost 
children, and towns-people for their country friends; and, 
unless you have an appointment at a certain place at an 
hour, you might as well prowl through the streets of London 
to find a friend as in the Great Exhibition. There is great 
beauty in the “Glass House.” Here, in the transept, with the 
glorious sunlight coming through that wonderful glass roof, 
may the taste be cultivated and improved, the mind edified, 
and the feelings chastened. Here, surrounded by noble 
creations in marble and bronze, and in the midst of an 
admiring throng, one may gaze at statuary which might fitly 
decorate the house of the proudest prince in Christendom.</p>
        <p>He who takes his station in the gallery, at either end, and 
looks upon that wondrous nave, or who surveys the matchless 
panorama around him from the intersection of the nave and 
transept, may be said, without presumption or exaggeration, 
to see all the kingdoms of this world and the glory of them. 
He sees not only a greater collection of fine articles, but 
also a greater as well as more various assemblage of the 
human race, than ever before was gathered under one roof.</p>
        <p>One of the beauties of this great international gathering 
is, that it is not confined to rank or grade. The million 
toilers from mine, and factory, and workshop,
<pb id="brown206" n="206"/>
and loom, and office, and field, share with their more 
wealthy neighbors the feast of reason and imagination spread 
out in the Crystal Palace.</p>
        <p>It is strange, indeed, to see so many nations assembled and 
represented on one spot of British ground. In short, it is 
one great theatre, with thousands of performers, each 
playing his own part. England is there, with her mighty 
engines toiling and whirring, indefatigable in her 
enterprises to shorten labor. India spreads her glitter and 
paint. France, refined and fastidious, is there every day, 
giving the last touch to her picturesque group; and the 
other countries, each in its turn doing what it can to show 
off. The distant hum of thousands of good-humored people, 
with occasionally a national anthem from some gigantic 
organ, together with the noise of the machinery, seems to 
send life into every part of the Crystal Palace.</p>
        <p>When you get tired of walking you can sit down and write 
your impressions, and there is the “post ” to receive your 
letter; or, if it be Friday or Saturday, you may, if you 
choose, rest yourself by hearing a lecture from Professor 
Anstead; and then, before leaving, take your last look, and 
see something that you have not before seen. Everything 
which is old in cities, new in colonial life, splendid in 
courts, useful in industry, beautiful in nature, or 
ingenious in invention, is there represented. In one place 
we have the Bible translated into one hundred and fifty 
languages; in another, we have saints and archbishops 
painted on glass; in another, old
<pb id="brown207" n="207"/>
palaces, and the altars of a John Knox, a Baxter, or some 
other divines of olden time. In the old Temple of Delphi we 
read that every state of the civilized world had its 
separate treasury, where Herodotus, born two thousand years 
before his time, saw and observed all kinds of prodigies in 
gold and silver, brass and iron, and even in linen. The 
nations all met there on one common ground, and the peace of 
the earth was not a little promoted by their common 
interest in the sanctity and splendor of that shrine. As 
long as the Exhibition lasts, and its memory endures, we 
hope and trust that it may shed the same influence. With 
this hasty scrap I take leave of the Great Exhibition.</p>

        <p>I HAVE just finished a short visit to the far-famed city of 
Oxford, which has not unaptly been styled the City of 
Palaces. Aside from this being one of the principal seats of 
learning in the world, it is distinguished alike for its 
religious and political changes in times past. At one time 
it was the seat of Popery; at another, the uncompromising 
enemy of Rome. Here the tyrant Richard the Third held his 
court; and when James the First and his son Charles the 
First found their capital too hot to hold them, they removed 
to their loyal city of Oxford. The writings of the great 
republicans were here committed to the flames. At one time 
Popery sent Protestants to the stake and fagot; at another, 
a Papist king found no favor with the people. A noble 
monument now stands where Cranmer, Ridley and Latimer, 
proclaimed their sentiments and faith, and sealed them with 
their blood. And now we read upon the town
<pb id="brown209" n="209"/>
treasurer's book—“For three loads of wood, one load of 
fagots, one post, two chains and staples, to burn Ridley 
and Latimer, £1 5<hi rend="italics">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italics">d</hi>.” Such is the information one gets 
by looking over the records of books written three 
centuries ago.</p>
        <p>It was a beautiful day on which I arrived at Oxford, and, 
instead of remaining in my hotel, I sallied forth to take a 
survey of the beauties of the city. I strolled into Christ 
Church Meadows, and there spent the evening in viewing the 
numerous halls of learning which surround that splendid 
promenade. And fine old buildings they are: centuries have 
rolled over many of them, hallowing the old walls, and 
making them gray with age. They have been for ages the 
chosen homes of piety and philosophy. Heroes and scholars 
have gone forth from their studies here into the great 
field of the world, to seek their fortunes, and to conquer 
and be conquered. As I surveyed the exterior of the 
different colleges, I could here and there see the 
reflection of the light from the window of some student, who 
was busy at his studies, or throwing away his time over some 
trashy novel, too many of which find their way into the 
trunks or carpet-bags of the young men on setting out for 
college. As I looked upon the walls of these buildings I 
thought, as the rough stone is taken from the quarry to the 
finisher, there to be made into an ornament, so was the 
young mind brought here to be cultivated and developed. Many 
a poor, unobtrusive young man, with the appearance of 
little or no ability, is here moulded into a 
<pb id="brown210" n="210"/>
hero, a scholar, a tyrant, or a friend of humanity. I never 
look upon these monuments of education without a feeling of 
regret that so few of our own race can find a place within 
their walls. And, this being the fact, I see more and more 
the need of our people being encouraged to turn their 
attention more seriously to self-education, and thus to take 
a respectable position before the world, by virtue of their 
own cultivated minds and moral standing.</p>
        <p>Education, though obtained by a little at a time, and that, 
too, over the midnight lamp, will place its owner in a 
position to be respected by all, even though he be black. I 
know that the obstacles which the laws of the land and of 
society place between the colored man and education in the 
United States are very great, yet if <hi rend="italics">one</hi> can break through 
these barriers more can; and if our people would only place 
the right appreciation upon education, they would find 
these obstacles are easier to be overcome than at first 
sight appears. A young man once asked Carlyle what was the 
secret of success. His reply was, “Energy; whatever you 
undertake, do it with all your might.” Had it not been for 
the possession of energy, I might now have been working as 
a servant for some brainless fellow who might be able to 
command my labor with his money, or I might have been yet 
toiling in chains and slavery. But thanks to energy, not 
only for my being to-day in a land of freedom, but also for 
my dear girls being in one of the best seminaries in 
France, instead of being in an American school, where the 
finger
<pb id="brown211" n="211"/>
of scorn would be pointed at them by those whose 
superiority rests entirely upon their having a whiter skin.</p>
        <p>Oxford is, indeed, one of the finest located places in the 
kingdom, and every inch of ground about it seems hallowed 
by interesting associations. The university, founded by the 
good King Alfred, still throws its shadow upon the sidewalk; 
and the lapse of ten centuries seems to have made but little 
impression upon it. Other seats of learning may be entitled 
to our admiration, but Oxford claims our veneration. Although 
the lateness of the night compelled me, yet I felt an 
unwillingness to tear myself from the scene of such 
surpassing interest. Few places in any country as noted as 
Oxford is are without some distinguished person residing 
within their precincts; and, knowing that the city of 
palaces was not an exception to this rule, I resolved to see 
some of its lions. Here, of course, is the head-quarters of 
the Bishop of Oxford, a son of the late William Wilberforce, 
Africa's noble champion. I should have been glad to have 
seen this distinguished pillar of the church; but I soon 
learned that the bishop's residence was out of town, and 
that he seldom visited the city, except on business. I then 
determined to see one who, although a lesser dignitary in 
the church, is, nevertheless, scarcely less known than the 
Bishop of Oxford. This was the Rev. Dr. Pusey, a divine 
whose name is known wherever the religion of Jesus is known 
and taught, and the acknowledged head of the Puseyites. On 
the second morning of my visit I proceeded to Christ Church 
Chapel, where the reverend
<pb id="brown212" n="212"/>
gentleman officiates. Fortunately I had an opportunity of 
seeing the doctor, and following close in his footsteps to 
the church. His personal appearance is anything but that of 
one who is the leader of a growing and powerful party in 
the church. He is rather under the middle size, and is 
round-shouldered, or rather stoops. His profile is more 
striking than his front face, the nose being very large and 
prominent. As a matter of course, I expected to see a large 
nose, for all great men have them. He has a thoughtful and 
somewhat sullen brow, a firm and somewhat pensive mouth, a 
cheek pale, thin, and deeply furrowed. A monk fresh from the 
cloisters of Tinterran Abbey, in its proudest days, could 
scarcely have made a more ascetic and solemn appearance 
than did Dr. Pusey on this occasion. He is not apparently 
above forty-five, or, at most, fifty years of age, and his 
whole aspect renders him an admirable study for an artist. 
Dr. Pusey's style of preaching is cold and tame, and one 
looking at him would scarcely believe that such an 
apparently uninteresting man could cause such an eruption 
in the church as he has. I was glad to find that a colored 
young man was among the students at Oxford.</p>
        <p>A few months since, I paid a visit to our countryman, 
Alexander Crummel, who is still pursuing his studies at 
Cambridge,—a place which, though inferior to Oxford as 
far as appearance is concerned, is yet said to be greatly 
its superior as a place of learning. In an hour's walk 
through the Strand, Regent-street or Piccadilly, in London, 
one may meet half a dozen colored men, who are
<pb id="brown213" n="213"/>
inmates of the various colleges in the metropolis. These 
are all signs of progress in the cause of the sons of 
Africa. Then let our people take courage, and with that 
courage let them apply themselves to learning. A 
determination to excel is the sure road to greatness, and 
that is as open to the black man as the white. It is that 
which has accomplished the mightiest and noblest triumphs in 
the intellectual and physical world. It is that which has 
made such rapid strides towards civilization, and broken the 
chains of ignorance and superstition which have so long 
fettered the human intellect. It was determination which 
raised so many worthy individuals from the humble walks of 
society, and from poverty, and placed them in positions of 
trust and renown. It is no slight barrier that can 
effectually oppose the determination of the will;—
success must ultimately crown its efforts. “The world shall 
hear of me,” was the exclamation of one whose name has 
become as familiar as household words. A Toussaint once 
labored in the sugar-field with his spelling-book in his 
pocket, amid the combined efforts of a nation to keep him in 
ignorance. His name is now recorded among the list of 
statesmen of the past. A Soulouque was once a slave, and 
knew not how to read. He now sits upon the throne of an 
empire.</p>
        <p>In our own country there are men who once held the plough, 
and that too without any compensation, who are now presiding 
at the editor's table. It was determination that brought out 
the genius of a Franklin, and a
<pb id="brown214" n="214"/>
Fulton, and that has distinguished many of the American 
statesmen, who, but for their energy and determination, 
would never have had a name beyond the precincts of their 
own homes.</p>
        <p>It is not always those who have the best advantages, or the 
greatest talents, that eventually succeed in their 
undertakings: but it is those who strive with untiring
diligence to remove all obstacles to success, and who, with 
unconquerable resolution, labor on until the rich reward of 
perseverance is within their grasp. Then again let me say to 
our young men, Take courage. “There is a food time coming.” 
The darkness of the night appears greatest just before the 
dawn of day.</p>

        <p>THE love of freedom is one of those natural impulses of the 
human breast which cannot be extinguished. Even the brute 
animals of the creation feel and show sorrow and affection 
when deprived of their liberty. Therefore is a distinguished 
writer justified in saying, “Man is free, even were he born 
in chains.” The Americans boast, and justly too, that 
Washington was the hero and model patriot of the American 
Revolution,—the man whose fame, unequalled in his own 
day and country, will descend to the end of time, the pride 
and honor of humanity. The American speaks with pride of the
battles of Lexington and Bunker Hill; and, when standing 
in Faneuil Hall, he points to the portraits of Otis,
Adams, Hancock, Quincy, Warren and Franklin, and
<pb id="brown216" n="216"/>
tells you that their names will go down to posterity among 
the world's most devoted and patriotic friends of human 
liberty.</p>
        <p>It was on the first of August, 1851, that a number of men, 
fugitives from that boasted land of freedom, assembled at 
the Hall of Commerce in the city of London, for the purpose 
of laying their wrongs before the British nation, and, at 
the same time, to give thanks to the God of freedom for the 
liberation of their West India brethren on the first of 
August, 1834. Little notice had been given of the intended 
meeting, yet it seemed to be known in all parts of the city. 
At the hour of half-past seven, for which the meeting had 
been called, the spacious hall was well filled, and the 
fugitives, followed by some of the most noted English 
Abolitionists, entered the hall, amid the most deafening 
applause, and took their seats on the platform. The 
appearance of the great hall at this juncture was most 
splendid. Besides the committee of fugitives, on the 
platform there were a number of the oldest and most devoted 
of the slaves' friends. On the left of the chair sat Geo. 
Thompson, Esq., M.P.; near him was the Rev. Jabez Burns, 
D.D., and by his side the Rev. John Stevenson, M.A., Wm. 
Farmer, Esq., R. Smith, Esq.; while on the other side were 
Joseph Hume, Esq., M.P., John Lee, LL.D., Sir J. Walmsley, 
M.P., the Rev. Edward Matthews, John Cunliff, Esq., Andrew 
Paton, Esq., J. P. Edwards, Esq., and a number of colored 
gentlemen from the West Indies. The body of the hall was not 
without its distinguished guests. The
<pb id="brown217" n="217"/>
Chapmans and Westons of Boston, U. S., were there. The 
Estlins and Tribes had come all the way from Bristol to 
attend the great meeting. The Patons, of Glasgow, had 
delayed their departure, so as to be present. The Massies 
had come in from Upper Clapton. Not far from the platform 
sat Sir Francis Knowles, Bart.: still further back was 
Samuel Bowly, Esq., while near the door were to be seen the 
greatest critic of the age, and England's best living poet. 
Macaulay had laid aside the pen, entered the hall, and was 
standing near the central door, while not far from the 
historian stood the newly-appointed Poet Laureate. The 
author of “In Memoriam” had been swept in by the crowd, and 
was standing with his arms folded, and beholding for the 
first time (and probably the last) so large a number of 
colored men in one room. In different parts of the hall 
were men and women from nearly all parts of the kingdom, 
besides a large number who, drawn to London by the 
Exhibition, had come in to see and hear these oppressed 
people plead their own cause.</p>
        <p>The writer of this sketch was chosen chairman of the 
meeting, and commenced its proceedings by delivering the 
following address, which we cut from the columns
of the <hi rend="italics">Morning Advertiser:</hi></p>
        <p>“The chairman, in opening the proceedings, remarked
that, although the metropolis had of late been inundated
with meetings of various characters, having reference to
almost every variety of subjects, yet that the subject
<pb id="brown218" n="218"/>
they were called upon that evening to discuss differed from 
them all. Many of those by whom he was surrounded, like 
himself, had been victims to the inhuman institution of 
slavery, and were in consequence exiled from the land of 
their birth. They were fugitives from their native land, but 
not fugitives from justice; and they had not fled from a 
monarchical, but from a so-called republican government. 
They came from amongst a people who declared, as part of 
their creed, that all men were born free; but who, while 
they did so, made slaves of every sixth man, woman and 
child, in the country. (Hear, hear.) He must not, however, 
forget that one of the purposes for which they were met that 
night was to commemorate the emancipation of their brothers 
and sisters in the isles of the sea. That act of the 
British Parliament, and he might add in this case, with 
peculiar emphasis, of the British nation, passed on the 
twelfth day of August, 1883, to take effect on the first 
day of August, 1834, and which enfranchised eight hundred
thousand West Indian slaves, was an event sublime in its 
nature, comprehensive and mighty in its immediate influences 
and remote consequences, precious beyond expression to the 
cause of freedom, and encouraging beyond the measure of any 
government on earth to the hearts of all enlightened and 
just men. This act was the result of a long course of 
philanthropic and Christian efforts on the part of some of 
the best men that the world ever produced. It was not his 
intention to go into a discussion or a calculation of the 
rise and fall of property, or
<pb id="brown219" n="219"/>
whether sugar was worth more or less by the act of
emancipation. But the abolition of slavery in the West 
Indies was a blow struck in the right direction, at that 
most inhuman of all traffics, the slave-trade—a trade 
which would never cease so long as slavery existed; for 
where there was a market there would be merchandise; where 
there was demand there would be a supply; where there were 
carcasses there would be vultures; and they might as well 
attempt to turn the water, and make it run up the Niagara 
river, as to change this law.</p>
        <p>“It was often said by the Americans that England was 
responsible for the existence of slavery there, because it 
was introduced into that country while the colonies were 
under the British crown. If that were the case, they must 
come to the conclusion that, as England abolished slavery in 
the West Indies, she would have done the same for the 
American States if she had had the power to do it; and if 
that was so, they might safely say that the separation of 
the United States from the mother country was (to say the 
least) a great misfortune to one sixth of the population of 
that land. England had set a noble example to America, and 
he would to heaven his countrymen would follow the example. 
The Americans boasted of their superior knowledge; but they 
needed not to boast of their superior guilt, for that was 
set upon a hill-top, and that, too, so high, that it 
required not the lantern of Diogenes to find it out. Every 
breeze from the western world brought upon its wings the 
groans and cries of the victims of this guilt. Nearly all 
countries
<pb id="brown220" n="220"/>
had fixed the seal of disapprobation on slavery; and when, 
at some future age, this stain on the page of history shall 
be pointed at, posterity will blush at the discrepancy 
between American profession and American practice. What was 
to be thought of a people boasting of their liberty, their 
humanity, their Christianity, their love of justice, and at 
the same time keeping in slavery nearly four millions of 
God's children, and shutting out from them the light of the 
Gospel, by denying the Bible to the slave! (Hear, hear.) No 
education, no marriage, everything done to keep the mind of 
the slave in darkness. There was a wish on the part of the 
people of the Northern States to shield themselves from the 
charge of slaveholding; but, as they shared in the guilt, he 
was not satisfied with letting them off without their share 
in the odium.</p>
        <p>“And now a word about the Fugitive Slave Bill. That measure 
was in every respect an unconstitutional measure. It set 
aside the right formerly enjoyed by the a fugitive of trial 
by jury; it afforded to him no protection, no opportunity of 
proving his right to be free; and it placed every free 
colored person at the mercy of any unprincipled individual 
who might wish to lay claim to him. (Hear.) That law is 
opposed to the principles of Christianity—foreign alike 
to the laws of God and man. It had converted the whole 
population of the Free States into a band of slave-catchers, 
and every rood of territory is but so much hunting-ground, 
over which they might chase the fugitive. But while they were
<pb id="brown221" n="221"/>
speaking of slavery in the United States, they must not 
omit to mention that there was a strong feeling in that 
land, not only against the Fugitive Slave Law, but also 
against the existence of slavery in any form. There was a 
band of fearless men and women in the United States, whose 
labors for the slave had resulted in good beyond 
calculation. This noble and heroic class had created an 
agitation in the whole country, until their principles have 
taken root in almost every association in the land, and 
which, with God's blessing, will, in due time, cause the 
Americans to put into practice what they have so long 
professed. (Hear, hear.) He wished it to be continually held 
up before the country, that the Northern States are as 
deeply implicated in the guilt of slavery as the South. The 
North had a population of 13,553,328 freemen; the South had 
a population of only 6,393,756 freemen; the North has 152 
representatives in the House, the South only 81; and it 
would be seen by this that the balance of power was with 
the Free States. Looking, therefore, at the question in all 
its aspects, he was sure that there was no one in this 
country but who would find out that the slavery of the 
United States of America was a system the most abandoned 
and the most tyrannical. (Hear, hear.)”</p>
        <p>At the close of this address, the Rev. Edward Matthews, 
from Bristol, but who had recently returned from the United 
States, where he had been maltreated on account of his 
fidelity to the cause of freedom, was 
<pb id="brown222" n="222"/>
introduced, and made a most interesting speech. The next
speaker was George Thompson, Esq., M.P.; and we
need only say that his eloquence, which has seldom if
ever been equalled, and never surpassed, exceeded, on this
occasion, the most sanguine expectations of his friends.
All who sat under the thundering anathemas which he
hurled against slavery seemed instructed, delighted, and
animated. Scarcely any one could have remained 
unmoved by the pensive sympathies that pervaded the entire
assembly. There were many in the meeting who had
never seen a fugitive slave before, and when any of the
speakers would refer to those on the platform the whole
audience seemed moved to tears. No meeting of the
kind held in London for years created a greater 
sensation than this gathering of refugees from the “Land of
the free, and the home of the brave.”</p>
        <p>The Rev. J. Burns, D.D., next made an eloquent speech, and 
was followed by J. P. Edwards, Esq.</p>

        <p>AFTER strolling, for more than two hours, through the 
beautiful town of Lemington, in which I had that morning 
arrived, a gentleman, to whom I had a letter of 
introduction, asked me if I was not going to visit 
Shakspeare's House. It was only then that I called to mind 
the fact that I was within a few miles of the birthplace of 
the world's greatest literary genius. A horse and chaise was 
soon procured, and I on my way to Stratford. A quick and 
pleasant ride brought me to the banks of the Avon, and, a 
short time after, to the little but picturesque town of 
Stratford. I gave the horse in charge of the man-of-all-work 
at the inn, and then started for the much-talked-of and 
celebrated cottage. I found it to be a small, mean-looking 
house of wood and plaster, the walls of which are covered 
with names, inscriptions and hieroglyphics, in every 
language, by people of all nations, ranks and conditions, 
from the highest to the
<pb id="brown224" n="224"/>
lowest, who have made their pilgrimage there. The old
shattered and worn-out stock of the gun with which
Shakspeare shot Sir Thomas Lucy's deer was shown to
us. The old-fashioned tobacco-box was also there. The
identical sword with which he played Hamlet, the 
lantern with which Romeo and Juliet were discovered, lay
on the table. A plentiful supply of Shakspeare's 
mulberry-tree was there, and we were asked if we did not
want to purchase; but, fearing that it was not the genuine 
article, we declined. In one of the most gloomy and
dilapidated rooms is the old chair in which the poet used
to sit. After viewing everything of interest, and paying 
the elderly young woman (old maid) her accustomed fee, we 
left the poet's birthplace to visit his grave. We were soon 
standing in the chancel of the parish church, a large and 
venerable edifice, mouldering with age, but finely 
ornamented within, and the ivy clinging around
without. It stands in a beautiful situation on the banks 
of the Avon. Garrick has most truthfully said:</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“Thou soft-flowing Avon, by thy silver stream </l>
          <l>Of things more than mortal sweet Shakspeare would dream; </l>
          <l>The fairies by moonlight dance round his green bed, </l>
          <l>For hallowed the turf is which pillowed his head.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>The picturesque little stream runs murmuring at the
foot of the church-yard, disturbed only by the branches 
of the large elms that stand on the banks, and whose
limbs droop down. A flat stone is the only thing that
marks the place where the poet lies buried. I copied
<pb id="brown225" n="225"/>
the following verse from the stone, and which is said to 
have been written by the bard himself:</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“Good friend, for Jesus' sake, forbeare </l>
          <l>To dig the dust enclosed here: </l>
          <l>Blessed be he that spares these stones, </l>
          <l>And cursed be he that moves my bones.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Above the grave, in a niche in the wall, is a bust of the 
poet, placed there not long after his death, and which is 
supposed to bear some resemblance. Shakspeare's wife and 
daughter lie near him. After beholding everything of any 
possible interest, we stepped into our chaise and were soon 
again in Lemington; which, by the by, is the most beautiful 
town in all Great Britain, not excepting Cheltenham. In the 
evening I returned to Coventry, and was partaking of the 
hospitality of my excellent friend, Joseph Cash, Esq., of 
Sherburne House, and had stretched myself out on a sofa, 
with Carlyle's Life of Stirling in my hands, when I was 
informed that the younger members of the family were 
preparing to attend a lecture at the Mechanics' Institution. 
I did not feel inclined to stir from my easy position, after 
the fatigues of the day; but, learning that the lecturer 
was George Dawson, Esq., I resolved to join the company.</p>
        <p>The hall was nearly filled when we reached it, which was 
only a few minutes before the commencement of the lecture. 
The stamping of feet and clapping of hands—which is the 
best evidence of an Englishman's impatience—brought 
before us a thin-faced, spare-made,
<pb id="brown226" n="226"/>
wiry-looking man, with rather a dark complexion for an 
Englishman, but with prepossessing features. I must confess 
that I entered the room with some little prejudice against 
the speaker, caused by an unfavorable criticism from the pen 
of George Gilfillan, the essayist. However, I was happily 
disappointed. His style is witty, keen and gentle, with the 
language of the drawing-room. His smiling countenance, 
piercing glance and musical voice, captivated his audience. 
Mr. Dawson's subject was “The Rise and Spread of the 
Anglo-Saxon Race,” and he showed that be understood his task. 
During his discourse he said:</p>
        <p>“The Greeks and Romans sent out colonies; but no nation but 
England ever before gave a nation birth. The Americans are 
a nation, with no language, no creed, no grave-yards. Their 
names are a derivation; and it is laughable to see the 
pains an American takes to appear national. He will soon 
explain to you that he is not an Englishman, but a free-born 
citizen of the United States, with a pretty considerable 
contempt for them British-ers. These notions make an 
Englishman smile; the Americans are a nation without being 
a nation; they are impressed with an idea that they have 
characteristics,—they are odd, not national, and remind 
one of a long slender youth, somewhat sallow, who has just 
had a new watch, consequently blasphemes the old one; and as 
for the watch his father used, what is it?—a turnip; by 
this means he assumes the independent. The American <hi rend="italics">is</hi> 
independent; he flaunts it in your face, and surprises
<pb id="brown227" n="227"/>
you with his galvanic attempts at showing off his 
nationality. They have, in fact, no literature; we don't 
want them to have any, as long as they can draw from the 
old country; the feeling is kindly, and should be cherished; 
it is like the boy at Christmas coming home to spend the 
holidays. Long may they draw inspiration from Shakspeare 
and Milton, and come again and again to the old well. 
Walking down Broadway is like looking at a page of the 
Polyglot Bible. America was founded in a great thought, 
peopled through liberty; and long may that country be the 
noblest thing that England has to boast of.</p>
        <p>“Some people think that we, as a nation, arc going down; 
that we have passed the millennium; but there is no reason 
yet. We have work to do,—gold mines to dig, railways to 
construct, &amp;c. &amp;c. When all the work is done, then, and not 
till then, will the Saxon folk have finished their destiny. 
We have continents to fill yet; our work is not done till 
Europe is free. When Emerson visited us, he said that 
England was not an old country, but had the two-fold 
character of youth and age; he saw now cities, new docks; a 
good day's work yet to be done, and many vast undertakings 
only just begun. The coal, the iron and the gold, are ours; 
we have noble days in store, but we must labor more than we 
have yet done. Talk of going down!—we have hardly 
arrived at our meridian. We have our faults; any Frenchman 
or German may point them out. We have our duties, and often 
waste our precious moments by indulging in one
<pb id="brown228" n="228"/>
eternal grumble at what we do, compared to what we ought to 
do. A little praise is good sometimes,—we walk the 
taller for it, and work the better. Only as we know our 
work here, and do it as our fathers did, shall we promote 
good; working heartily, and not faltering until the object 
is gained. The more we add to the happiness of a people, the 
more we shall be worthy of the good gifts of God.”</p>
        <p>As an orator, Mr. Dawson stands deservedly high; and was on 
several occasions applauded to the echo. He was educated 
for the ministry in the Orthodox persuasion, but left it and 
became a Unitarian, and has since gone a step further. Mr. 
Dawson resides in Birmingham, where he has a fine chapel, 
and a most intellectual congregation, and is considered the 
Theodore Parker of England.</p>
        <p>It is indeed strange, the impression which a mind well 
cultivated can make upon those about it; and in this we see 
more clearly the need of education. In whatever light we 
view education, it cannot fail to appear the most important 
subject that can engage the attention of mankind. When we 
contrast the ignorance, the rudeness and the helplessness 
of the savage, with the knowledge, the refinement and the 
resources of civilized man, the difference between them 
appears so wide, that they can scarcely be regarded as of 
the same species; yet compare the infant of the savage with 
that of the educated and enlightened philosopher, and you 
will find them in all respects the same. The same <hi rend="italics">high, 
capacious</hi>
<pb id="brown229" n="229"/>
<hi rend="italics">powers</hi> of the mind lie folded up in both, and in both the
organs of sensation adapted to these mental powers are
exactly similar. All the difference which is afterwards
to distinguish them depends entirely upon their 
education, energy and self-culture.</p>

        <p>IT was in the latter part of December, and on one of the 
coldest nights that I have experienced, that I found myself 
seated before the fire, and alone, in the principal hotel in 
the town of Ludlow, and within a few minutes' walk of the 
famous old castle from which the town derives its name. A 
ride of one hundred and fifty miles by rail, in such 
uncomfortable carriages as no country except Great Britain 
furnishes for the weary traveller, and twenty miles on the 
top of a coach, in a drenching rain, caused me to remain by 
the fire's side to a later hour than I otherwise would have 
done. “Did you ring, sir?” asked the waiter, as the clock 
struck twelve. “No,” I replied; but I felt that this was 
the servant's mode of informing me that it was time for me 
to retire to bed, and consequently I asked for a candle, and 
was
<pb id="brown231" n="231"/>
shown to my chamber, and was soon in bed. From the weight 
of the covering on the bed, I felt sure that the extra 
blanket which I had requested to be put on was there; yet I 
was shivering with cold. As the sheets began to get warm, I 
discovered, to my astonishment, that they were damp; indeed, 
wet. My first thought was to ring the bell for the 
chambermaid, and have them changed; but, after a moment's 
consideration, I resolved to adopt a different course. I got 
out of bed, pulled the sheets off, rolled them up, raised 
the window, and threw them into the street. After disposing 
of the wet sheets, I returned to bed and got in between the 
blankets, and lay there trembling with cold till Morpheus 
came to my relief. The next morning I said nothing about 
the uncomfortable night I had experienced, and determined 
to leave it until they discovered the loss of the sheets. As 
soon as I had breakfasted, I went out to view the castle. 
For many years this was one of the strongest baronial 
fortifications in England. It was from Ludlow
Castle that Edward, Prince of Wales, and his brother,
were taken to London and put to death in the Tower, by
order of their uncle, Richard III., before that villain
seized upon the crown. The family of Mortimer for centuries 
held the castle, and, consequently, ruled Herefordshire. 
The castle rises from the point of a headland, and
its foundations are ingrafted into a bare gray rock. The
front consists of square towers, with high connecting
walls. The castle is a complete ruin, and has been for
centuries; large trees are still growing in the midst of
<pb id="brown232" n="232"/>
the old pile, which give it a picturesque appearance. It 
was here that the exquisite effusion of the youthful genius 
of Milton—The Masque of Comus—was composed, and 
performed before His Majesty Charles I., in 1631. Little 
did the king think that the poet would one day be secretary 
to the man who should put him to death and rule his kingdom. 
Although a ruin, this fact is enough to excite interest, and 
to cause one to venerate the old building, and to do homage 
to the memory of the divine poet who hallowed it with his 
immortal strains. From a visitor's book that is kept at the 
gate-house, I copied the following verses:</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“Here Milton sung; what needs a greater spell</l>
          <l>To lure thee, stranger, to these far-famed walls?</l>
          <l>Though chroniclers of other ages tell</l>
          <l>That princes oft have graced fair Ludlow's halls,</l>
          <l>Their honors glide along oblivion's stream,</l>
          <l>And o'er the wreck a tide of ruin drives;</l>
          <l>Faint and more faint the rays of glory beam</l>
          <l>That gild their course—the bard alone survives.</l>
          <l>And, when the rude, unceasing shocks of Time</l>
          <l>In one vast heap shall whelm this lofty pile,</l>
          <l>Still shall his genius, towering and sublime,</l>
          <l>Triumphant o'er the spoils of grandeur smile;</l>
          <l>Still in these haunts, true to a nation's tongue,</l>
          <l>Echo shall love to dwell, and say, Here Milton sung.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>I lingered long in the room pointed out to me as the
one in which Milton wrote his “Comus.” The castle was not 
only visited by the author of “Paradise Lost,” but here, 
amidst the noise and bustle of civil dissensions,
<pb id="brown233" n="233"/>
Samuel Butler, the satirical author of “Hudibras,” found an 
asylum. The part of the tower in which it is said he composed 
his “Hudibras” was shown to us. In looking over the different 
apartments, we passed through a cell with only one small 
window through which the light found its way. On a stone, 
chiselled with great beauty, was a figure in a weeping 
position, and underneath it some one had written with 
pencil, in a legible hand:</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“The Muse, too, weeps; in hallowed hour </l>
          <l>Here sacred Milton owned her power, </l>
          <l>And woke to nobler song.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>The weather was exceedingly cold, and made more so by the 
stone walls partly covered with snow and frost around us; 
and I returned to the inn. It being near the time for me to 
leave by the coach for Hereford, I called for my bill. The 
servant went out of the room; but soon returned, and began 
stirring up the fire with the poker. I again told him that 
the coach would shortly be up, and that I wanted my bill. 
“Yes, sir, in a moment,” he replied, and left in haste. Ten 
or fifteen minutes passed away, and the servant once more 
came in, walked to the window, pulled up the blinds, and 
then went out. I saw that something was in the wind; and it 
occurred to me that they had discovered the loss of the 
sheets. The waiter soon returned again, and, in rather an 
agitated manner, said, “I beg your pardon, sir, but the 
landlady is in the hall, and would like to speak to you.” 
Out I went, and found the finest specimen of an 
<pb id="brown234" n="234"/>
English landlady that I had seen for many a day. There
she stood, nearly as thick as she was high, with a red
face, garnished around with curls, that seemed to say,
“I have just been brushed and oiled.” A neat apron
covered a black alpacca dress that swept the ground with
modesty, and a bunch of keys hung at her side. O, that 
smile! such a smile as none but a woman who had often 
been before a mirror could put on. However, I had studied 
human nature too successfully not to know that thunder 
and lightning were concealed tinder that smile; and I 
nerved myself up for the occasion. “I am sorry to have to 
name it, sir,” said she, “but the sheets are missing off 
your bed.” “O, yes,” I replied; “I took them off last 
night.” “Indeed!” exclaimed she; “and pray what have you 
done with them?” “I threw them out of the window,” said I. 
“What! into the street?” “Yes, into the street,” I said. 
“What did you do that for?” “They were wet; and I was afraid 
that if I left them in the room they would be put on at 
night, and give somebody else a cold.” And here I coughed 
with all my might, to remind her that I had suffered from 
the negligence of her chambermaid. The heaving of the chest 
and panting for breath which the lady was experiencing at 
this juncture told me plainly that an explosion was at hand; 
and the piercing glance of those wicked-looking black eyes, 
and the rapid changes that came over that 
never-to-be-forgotten face, were enough to cause the most 
love-sick man in the world to give up all ideas of matrimony, 
and to be contented with being his
<pb id="brown235" n="235"/>
own master. “Then, sir,” said the landlady, “you will have 
to pay for the sheets.” “O, yes,” replied I; “I will pay 
for them; put them in the bill, and I will send the bill to 
<hi rend="italics">The Times</hi>, and have it published, and let the travelling 
public know how much you charge for wet sheets!” and I 
turned upon my heel and walked into the room.</p>
        <p>A few minutes after, the servant came in and laid before me 
the bill. I looked, but in vain, to see how much I had been 
charged for my hasty indiscretion the previous night. No 
mention was made of the sheets; and I paid the bill as it 
stood. The blowing of the coachman's horn warned me that I 
must get ready; and I put on my top coat. As I was passing 
through the hall, there stood the landlady just where I had 
left her, looking as if she had not stirred a single peg. 
And that smile, that had often cheered or carried 
consternation to many a poor heart, was still to be seen. I 
would rather have gone without my dinner than to have looked 
her in the face, such is my timidity. But common courtesy 
demanded that I should at least nod as I passed by; and 
therefore I was thrown back upon my manners, and 
unconsciously found myself giving her one of my best bows. 
Whether this bow was the result of my early training while 
in slavery, the domestic discipline that I afterwards 
experienced in freedom, or the terror with which every nerve 
was shaken on first meeting the landlady, I am still 
unaware. However, the bow was made and the ice broken, and 
the landlady smilingly said, “You do not
<pb id="brown236" n="236"/>
know, sir, how much I am grieved at your being put to so 
much trouble last night, with those wet sheets; it was all 
the fault of the chambermaid, and I have given her warning, 
and shall dismiss her a month from to-day. And I do hope, 
sir, that if you should ever mention this circumstance you 
will not name the house in which it occurred.” How could I 
do otherwise than to acquiesce in her wishes? Yes, I 
promised that I would never name the inn at which I had 
caught the rheumatism; and, therefore, reader, you may ask 
me, but in vain,—I will not tell you. One more bow, and 
out I went, and mounted the coach. As the driver was pulling 
up his reins, and raising his whip in the air, I turned to 
take a farewell glance of the inn, when, to my surprise, I 
beheld the landlady at the door with a white handkerchief in 
her hand, and a countenance beaming with smiles that I still 
see in my mind's eye. I raised my hat, she nodded, and away 
went the coach. Although the ride was a cold and dreary one, 
I often caught myself smiling over the fright in which I had 
put the landlady by threatening to publish her house.</p>
        <p>After a fatiguing stage twenty miles or more, over a bad 
road, we reached Hereford, a small city, situated in a 
fertile plain, bounded on all sides with orchards, and 
watered by the translucent Wye. I spent the greater part of 
the next day in seeing the lions of the little city. I first 
visited, what most strangers do, the cathedral; a building 
partly Gothic and partly Saxon in its architecture, the 
interior of which is handsome, and contains
<pb id="brown237" n="237"/>
an excellent organ, a piece of furniture that often calls 
more hearers to a place of worship than the preacher. In 
passing through the cathedral I stood a moment or two over 
the grave of the poet Phillips, the author of the “Splendid 
Shilling,” “Cider,” etc. While in the library the verger 
showed me a manuscript Bible of Wickliffe's, the first in 
use, written on vellum in the old black letter, full of 
abbreviations. He also pointed out some Latin manuscripts, 
in various parts beautifully illuminated with most ingenious 
penmanship, the coloring of the figures very bright. After 
all, there is a degree of pleasure in bundling those old and 
laid-aside books. Hereford is noted for having been the 
birthplace of several distinguished persons. I was shown the 
house in which David Garrick was born. From Hereford he was 
removed to Litchfield and became the pupil of Dr. Johnson, 
and eventually both master and pupil went to London in 
search of bread; one became famous as an actor, the other 
noted as <hi rend="italics">surly Sam Johnson</hi>. An obscure cottage in Pipe-lane 
was pointed out as the birthplace of the celebrated Nell 
Gwynne, who first appeared in London in the pit of 
Drury-lane Theatre as an apple-girl, and afterwards became 
an actress, in which position she was seen by King Charles 
II., who took her to his bed and board, and created her 
Duchess of St. Albans. However, she had many crooked paths 
to tread, after becoming an actress, before she captivated 
the heart of the <hi rend="italics">Merry Monarch</hi>. The following story of
<pb id="brown238" n="238"/>
her life, told by herself, is too good to be lost; so I 
insert it here.</p>
        <p>“When I was a poor girl,” said the Duchess of St. Albans, 
“working very hard for my thirty shillings a week, I went 
down to Liverpool during the holidays, where I was always 
well received. I was to perform in a new piece, something 
like those pretty little affecting dramas they get up now at 
our minor theatres; and in my character I represented a 
poor, friendless orphan-girl, reduced to the most wretched 
poverty. A heartless tradesman prosecutes the sad heroine 
for a heavy debt, and insists on putting her in prison, 
unless some one will be bail for her. The girl replies, 
‘Then I have no hope; I have not a friend in the world.’ 
‘What! will no one be bail for you, to save you from going 
to prison?’ asks the stern creditor. ‘I have told you I have 
not a friend on earth,’ was the reply. But just as I was 
uttering the words, I saw a sailor in the upper gallery 
springing over the railing, letting himself down from one 
tier to another, until he bounded clear over the orchestra 
and footlights, and placed himself beside me in a moment.
‘Yes, you shall have <hi rend="italics">one</hi> friend at least, my poor young 
woman,’ said he, with the greatest expression in his honest, 
sunburnt countenance; ‘I will go bail for you to any amount. 
And as for <hi rend="italics">you</hi>,’ turning to the frightened actor, ‘if you 
don't bear a hand and shift your moorings, you lubber, it 
will be worse for you when I come athwart your bows!’ Every 
creature in the house rose; the uproar was indescribable—
peals of
<pb id="brown239" n="239"/>
laughter, screams of terror, cheers from his tawny 
mess-mates in the gallery, preparatory scrapings of violins 
from the orchestra; and, amidst the universal din, there 
stood the unconscious cause of it, sheltering me, ‘the 
poor, distressed young woman,’ and breathing defiance and 
destruction against my mimic persecutor. He was only 
persuaded to relinquish his care of me, by the manager 
pretending to arrive and rescue me, with a profusion of 
theatrical bank-notes.”</p>
        <p>Hereford was also the birthplace of Mrs. Siddons, the 
unequalled tragic actress. The views around Hereford are 
very sylvan, and from some points, where the Welsh mountains 
are discernible, present something of the magnificent. All 
this part of the country still shows unmistakable evidence 
that war has had its day here. In those times the arts and 
education received no encouragement. The destructive 
exploits of conquerors may dazzle for a while, but the 
silent labors of the student and the artist, of the 
architect and the husbandman, which embellish the earth, 
and convert it into a terrestrial paradise, although they do 
not shine with so conspicuous a glare, diversify the picture 
with milder colors and more beautiful shades.</p>

        <p>IF there be an individual living who has read the “Essay on 
Man,” or “The Rape of the Lock,” without a wish to become 
more acquainted with the writings of the gifted poet that 
penned those exquisite poems, I confess that such an one is 
made of different materials from myself.</p>
        <p>It is possible that I am too great a devotee to authors, and 
especially poets; yet such is my reverence for departed 
writers, that I would rather walk five miles to see a poet's 
grave than to spend an evening at the finest entertainment 
that could be got up.</p>
        <p>It was on a pleasant afternoon in September, that I had gone 
into Surrey to dine with Lord C——, that I found myself 
one of a party of nine, and seated at a table
<pb id="brown241" n="241"/>
loaded with everything that the heart could wish. Four 
men-servants, in livery, with white gloves, waited upon the 
company.</p>
        <p>After the different courses had been changed, the wine 
occupied the most conspicuous place on the table, and all 
seemed to drink with a relish unappreciated except by those 
who move in the higher walks of life. My glass was the only 
one on the table in which the juice of the grape had not 
been poured. It takes more nerve than most men possess to 
cause one to decline taking a glass of wine with a lady; and 
in English society they don't appear to understand how human 
beings can live and enjoy health without taking at least a 
little wine. By my continued refusal to drink with first one 
and then another of the company, I had become rather an 
object of pity than otherwise.</p>
        <p>A lady of the party, and in company with whom I had dined on 
a previous occasion, and who knew me to be an abstainer, 
resolved to relieve me from the awkward position in which 
my principles had placed me, and therefore caused a decanter 
of raspberry vinegar to be adulterated and brought on the 
table. A note in pencil from the lady informed me of the 
contents of the new bottle. I am partial to this kind of 
beverage, and felt glad when it made its appearance. No one 
of the party, except the lady, knew of the fraud; and I was 
able, during the remainder of the time, to drink with any of 
the company. The waiters, as a matter of course, were in the 
secret; for they had to make the change 
<pb id="brown242" n="242"/>
while passing the wine from me to the person with whom I 
drank.</p>
        <p>After a while, as is usual, the ladies all rose and left the 
room. The retiring of the fair sex left the gentlemen in a 
more free-and-easy position, and consequently the topics of 
conversation were materially changed, but not for the better. 
The presence of women is always a restraint in the right 
direction. An hour after the ladies had gone, the gentlemen 
were requested to retire to the drawing-room, where we found 
tea ready to be served up. I was glad when the time came to 
leave the dining-room, for I felt it a great bore to be 
compelled to remain at the table <hi rend="italics">three hours</hi>. Tea over, the 
wine again brought on, and the company took a stroll through 
the grounds at the back of the villa. It was a bright 
moonlight night, and the stars were out, and the air came 
laden with the perfume of sweet flowers, and there were no 
sounds to be heard, except the musical splashing of the 
little cascade at the end of the garden, and the song of the 
nightingale, that seemed to be in one of the trees near by. 
How pleasant everything looked, with the flowers creeping 
about the summer-house, and the windows opening to the 
velvet lawn, with its modest front, neat trellis-work, and 
meandering vine! The small smooth fish-pond, and the 
lifelike statues standing or kneeling in different parts of 
the grounds, gave it the appearance of a very paradise.</p>
        <p>“There,” said his lordship, “is where Cowley used to sit, 
under that tree, and read.”</p>
        <pb id="brown243" n="243"/>
        <p>This reminded me that I was near Chertsey, where the poet 
spent his last days; and, as I was invited to spend the 
night within a short ride of that place, I resolved to visit 
it the next day. We returned to the drawing-room, and a few 
moments after the party separated, at ten o'clock.</p>
        <p>After breakfast the following morning, I drove over to 
Chertsey, a pretty little town, with but two streets of any 
note. In the principal street, and not far from the railway 
station, stands a low building of wood and plaster, known as 
the <hi rend="italics">Porch House</hi>. It was in this cottage that Abraham Cowley, 
the poet, resided, and died in 1667, in the forty-ninth year 
of his age. It being the residence of a gentleman who was 
from home, I did not have an opportunity of seeing the 
interior of the building, which I much regretted. Having 
visited Cowley's house, I at once determined to do what I 
had long promised myself; that was, to see Pope's villa, at 
Twickenham; and I returned to London, took the Richmond 
boat, and was soon gliding up the Thames.</p>
        <p>I have seldom had a pleasanter ride by water than from London 
Bridge to Richmond; the beautiful panoramic view which 
unfolds itself on either side of the river can scarcely be 
surpassed by the scenery in any country. In the centre of 
Twickenham stands the house made celebrated from its having 
been the residence of Alexander Pope. The house is not 
large, but occupies a beautiful site, and is to be seen to 
best advantage from the river. The garden and grounds have 
undergone
<pb id="brown244" n="244"/>
some change since the death of the poet. The grotto leading 
from the villa to the Thames is in a sad condition.</p>
        <p>The following lines, written by Pope soon after finishing 
this idol of his fancy, show in what estimate he held it, 
and should at least have preserved it from decay:</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“Thou who shalt stop where <hi rend="italics">Thames'</hi> translucent wave</l>
          <l>Shines a broad mirror through the shadowy cave;</l>
          <l>Where lingering drops from mineral roofs distill,</l>
          <l>And pointed crystals break the sparkling rill;</l>
          <l>Unpolished gems no ray on pride bestow,</l>
          <l>And latent metals innocently glow—</l>
          <l>Approach! Great nature studiously behold!</l>
          <l>And eye the mine without a wish for gold.</l>
          <l>Approach—but awful! Lo! the Ægerian grot,</l>
          <l>Where, nobly pensive, St. John sate and thought;</l>
          <l>Where <hi rend="italics">British</hi> sighs from dying Wyndham stole,</l>
          <l>And the bright flame was shot through Marchmont's soul.</l>
          <l>Let such—such only—tread this sacred floor,</l>
          <l>Who dare to love their country and be poor.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>It is strange that there are some at the present day who 
deny that Pope was a poet; but it seems to me that such 
either show a want of appreciation of poetry, or themselves 
no judge of what constitutes poetry. Where can be found a 
finer effusion than the “Essay on Man”? Johnson, in his 
admirable Life of Pope, in drawing a comparison between him 
and Dryden, says, “If the flights of Dryden are higher, Pope 
continues longer on the wing; if of Dryden's fire the blaze 
is brighter, of Pope is the beat more regular and constant. 
Dryden
<pb id="brown245" n="245"/>
often surpasses expectation, and Pope never falls below it; 
Dryden is read with frequent astonishment, and Pope with 
perpetual delight.” In speaking of the “Rape of the Lock,” 
the same great critic remarks that it “stands forward in the 
classes of literature, as the most exquisite example of 
ludicrous poetry.” Another poet and critic of no mean 
authority calls him “The sweetest and most elegant of 
English poets, the severest chastiser of vice, and the most 
persuasive teacher of wisdom.” Lord Byron terms him “the 
most perfect and harmonious of poets.” How many have quoted 
the following lines without knowing that they were Pope's!</p>
        <lg type="lines">
          <l>“To look through Nature up to Nature's God.” </l>
          <l>“An honest man's the noblest work of God.” </l>
          <l>“Just as the twig is bent, the tree's inclined.”</l>
          <lg type="lines">
            <l>“If to her share some female errors fall,</l>
            <l>Look on her face, and you 'll forget them all.” </l>
          </lg>
          <lg type="lines">
            <l>“For modes of faith let graceless zealots fight, </l>
            <l>His can't be wrong whose life is in the right.”</l>
          </lg>
        </lg>
        <p>Pope was certainly the most independent writer of his time; 
a poet who never sold himself, and never lent his pen to the 
upholding of wrong. And although a severe critic, the 
following verse will show that he did not wish to bestow his 
chastisement in a wrong direction: </p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“Curst be the verse, how well soe'er it flow,</l>
          <l>That tends to make one honest man my foe,</l>
          <l>Give Virtue scandal, Innocence a fear,</l>
          <l>Or from the soft-eyed virgin steal a tear!”</l>
        </lg>
        <pb id="brown246" n="246"/>
        <p>No poet's pen was ever more thoroughly used to suppress vice 
than Pope's; and what he did was done conscientiously, as 
the following lines will show:</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“Ask you what provocation I have had? </l>
          <l>The strong antipathy of good to bad. </l>
          <l>When Truth or Virtue an affront endures, </l>
          <l>The affront is mine, my friend, and should be yours.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Pope is not only a poet of a high order, but as yet he is the
unsurpassed translator of Homer.</p>
        <p>My visit to Pope's villa was a short one, but it was attended 
with many pleasing incidents. I have derived much pleasure 
from reading his Iliad and other translations. The verse from 
the pen of Lord Denham, that heads this chapter, conveys but 
a faint idea of my estimate of Pope's genius and talents.</p>

        <p>WHILE on a recent visit to Dumfries, I lodged in the
same house with Robert Burns, the eldest son of the 
Scottish bard, who is now about sixty-five years old. I also 
visited the grave of the poet, which is in the church-yard 
at the lower end of the town. A few days afterwards I arrived 
at Ayr, and being within three miles of the birthplace of 
Burns, and having so lately stood over his grave, I felt no 
little interest in seeing the cottage in which he was born, 
and the monument erected to his memory; and therefore, after 
inquiring the road, I started on my pilgrimage. In going up 
the High Street, we passed the Wallace Tower, a Gothic 
building, with a statue of the renowned chief, out by Thom, 
the famed sculptor of “Tam O'Shanter and Souter Johnny,” 
occupying the highest niche. The Scottish hero is represented 
not in warlike attitude, but in a thoughtful mood, as if 
musing over the wrongs of his country. We were soon out of
<pb id="brown248" n="248"/>
the town, and on the high road to the “Land of Burns.” On 
the west side of the road, and about two miles from Ayr, 
stands the cottage in which the poet was born; it is now used 
as an ale-house or inn. This cottage was no doubt the 
fancied scene of that splendid poem, “The Cottar's Saturday 
Night.” A little further on, and we were near the old kirk, 
in the yard of which is the grave of Burns' father; marked 
by a plain tombstone, on which is engraved the following 
epitaph, from the pen of the poet:</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“O ye whose cheek the tear of pity stains,</l>
          <l>Draw near with pious reverence and attend; </l>
          <l>Here lie the loving husband's dear remains,</l>
          <l>The tender father, and the generous friend. </l>
          <l>The pitying heart that felt for human woe,</l>
          <l>The dauntless heart that feared no human pride, </l>
          <l>The friend of man—to vice alone a foe;</l>
          <l>'For e'en his failings leant to Virtue's side.’”</l>

        <p>A short distance beyond the church, we caught a sight of the 
“Auld Brig” crossing the Doon's classic stream, along which 
Tam O'Shanter was pursued by the witches, his “Gray Mare Meg” 
losing her tail in the struggle on the keystone. On the banks 
of the Doon stands the beautiful monument, surrounded by a 
little plat of ground very tastefully laid out. The edifice 
is of the composite order, blending the finest models of 
Grecian and Roman architecture. It is about sixty feet high; 
on the ground floor there is a circular room lighted by a
cupola of stained glass, in the centre of which stands a
<pb id="brown249" n="249"/>
table with relics, and editions of Burns' writings.
Amongst these relics is the Bible given by the poet to
his Highland Mary. It is bound in two volumes, which
are enclosed in a neat oaken box with a glass lid. In both 
volumes is written “Robert Burns, Mossgiel,” in the bard's 
own hand-writing. In the same room are the original far-famed 
figures of “Tam O'Shanter and Souter Johnny,” chiselled out 
of solid blocks of freestone, by the self-taught sculptor, 
Thom. No one can look at these statues without feeling that 
the poet has not more graphically described than the 
sculptor has delineated the jolly couple. Immediately on the 
banks of the river stands the Shell Palace. This most 
beautiful of little edifices is scarcely less to be admired 
than the monument itself.</p>
        <p>Like its great prototype, the Shell Palace, to be judged of, 
must be seen. It is not easy to describe even this miniature. 
Lying in the heart of the Monument scenery, it forms a 
fitting spot for something dazzlingly beautiful; and it 
realizes the aspiration. It is a palace of which rare and 
beautiful shells, gathered in many climes, form the entire 
surface, internal and external. The erection is twenty feet 
long, by fourteen and a half feet broad, and fourteen feet 
high in the roof. It is in form an irregular or oblong 
octagon—the two sides long, and the three sections at 
each end, of course, narrow, thus giving, by the cross 
reflections of no fewer than nineteen mirrors, an infinite 
multiplicity of its internal treasures. Of these the shells 
are the leading feature,
<pb id="brown250" n="250"/>
and many thousands of the rarest sorts go to make up this 
conchological wonder. The floor is covered with a very rich 
carpet, and rugs to match front two unique dwarf grates. The 
seats, set on imitation granite props, are covered with rich 
crimson velvet. Opposite the stained-glass entrance-door, in 
a recess, is a beautiful fountain, surrounded by large 
ornamental shells, playing from a delightful spring, the jet 
rising from a rich green vase, in tasteful contrast with the 
“winking gold-fish,” now sporting and now lazily floating 
round its base. The side walls are inlaid in the most regular 
and artistic manner with shells, which vary in size, the 
roof being studded with large ornamental shells, the upward 
unseen points of which, being bored, act as ventilators, 
while in the centre of the roof some of the very choicest 
middle-sized shells are grouped together in the form of 
flowers, with a very rich and beautiful effect, seldom 
attained in the choicest bouquets. With so much of the 
beautiful so very attractively arranged, the mirrors work 
wonders. The large mirrors at either end show a line of 
table as far as the eye can carry, and multiply the visitors 
accordingly—green vases and golden fish presenting 
themselves anew at every turn. The Doon ran silently past as 
we entered; but here it meanders round us on every side, and 
our fairy palace seems the centre of some enchanted island. 
It is, indeed, a beautiful grotto, and all who have not seen 
it will, we dare say, on visiting it, not begrudge it the 
title of the “Shell Palace.”</p>
        <pb id="brown251" n="251"/>
        <p>We next visited Newark Castle, about a mile from the 
monument. It is remarkable for its antiquity, and for the 
splendid view obtained from the balcony on its summit. While 
standing on this celebrated spot, we saw at one glance the 
Frith of Clyde and Bay of Ayr; in the immediate foreground 
the cradle-land of Burns, and the winding Doon; and in the 
distance the eye wonders over a vast tract of richly-wooded 
country, embracing a panoramic view of portions of at least 
seven counties, and the much-admired and celebrated rock, 
Ailsacraig. While in the neighborhood, we could not forego the
temptation which presented itself of visiting the scene of 
Burns' tender parting with Mary Campbell. It is near the 
junction of the water of Fail with the river Ayr, where the 
poet met his Mary on a Sunday in the month of May, and, 
laying their hands in the stream, vowed, over Mary's Bible, 
love while the woods of Montgomery grew and its waters ran. 
The death of the girl before the appointed time of marriage 
caused the composition of the following poem, one of Burns' 
sweetest pieces.</p>
        <lg type="verse">

        </lg>
        <p>It was indeed pleasant to walk over the ground once pressed 
by the feet of the Scottish bard, and to look upon the 
scenes that inspired his youthful breast, and gave animation 
to that blaze of genius that burst upon the world. The 
classic Doon, the ruins of the old kirk Alloway, the cottage 
in which the poet first drew breath, and other places made 
celebrated by his pen, all filled us with a degree of 
enthusiasm we have seldom experienced.

In every region where the English language is known the 
songs of Burns give rapture; and from every land, and from 
climes the most remote, comes the praise of Burns as a poet. 
In song-writing he surpassed Sir Walter Scott and Lord Byron; 
for in that department he was above “all Greek, above all 
Roman fame;” a more than Simonides in pathos, as in his 
“Highland Mary;” a more than Tyrtæus in fire, as in his 
“Scots wha ha'e wi' Wallace bled;” and a softer than Sappho 
in love, as in his—

        <p>IT was in the middle of May, when London is usually inundated 
with strangers from the country, who come up to attend the 
anniversaries, that a party of friends called on me with a 
request that I would accompany them to some of the lions of 
the metropolis. We started for the Thames Tunnel, one of the 
wonders of London. The idea of making a thoroughfare under 
the largest river in England was a project that could 
scarcely have been carried out by any except a most 
enterprising people. We faintly heard the clock on St. Paul's 
striking eleven, as the Woolwich boat put us down at the 
Tunnel; which we entered, after paying the admission fee of 
one penny. After descending one hundred steps, we found 
ourselves under the river, and looking towards the faint 
glimmer of light that showed itself on the Surrey side. There 
are two arches, one of which is closed up, with here and
<pb id="brown255" n="255"/>
there a stall, loaded with old maps, books, and views of the 
Tunnel. Lamps, some six or eight yards apart, light up the 
otherwise dark and dismal place. Signs of frequent repairs 
show that they must ever be on the watch to keep the water 
out. An hour spent in the Tunnel satisfied us all, and we 
left in the direction of the Tower, a description of which 
will be found in another chapter. Some of our party seemed 
bent on going next to the Colosseum, and to the Colosseum we 
went. On arriving at the doors, and entering a long, 
capacious passage, our eyes became quite dazzled by the 
gleams of colored light which shone upon them, both directly 
and reflectedly. The effect was heightened by the beautiful
designs which figured on the walls, and by the graceful
forms of the many statues which lined the path. In fact,
the strength of the sense of sight became much greater,
because the ear, which, all the day before, had listened to
the busy hum of bustle and activity, now ceased to hear
aught but a silent whisper or a wondering “O,”—no
echo had even the foot-fall from the luxuriant softness of
the carpeting.</p>
        <p>Following up this fairy viaduct, we merged into a spacious 
circularly-formed apartment, on the downy conches of which 
reclined many an enraptured group; while nimble fingers and 
enticing lips caused sweet harmonious strains to chase each 
other from niche to niche, and among marbled figures within 
that charming temple.</p>
        <p>Ascending a narrow flight of stairs, we landed on a
balcony, from which we viewed the principal spectacle
<pb id="brown256" n="256"/>
exhibited—and, O, it was a grand one! We found ourselves, 
as it were, upon the summit of some high building in the 
centre of the French metropolis, and there, all brilliant 
with gas-lights, and favored by the shining moon, Paris lay 
spread far out beneath us, though the canvas on which the 
scene was painted was but half a dozen feet from where we 
gazed in wonder. The moon herself seemed actually in the 
heavens. Nay, bets were laid that she had risen since we 
entered. Nothing can surpass the uniformity of appearance 
which every spire, and house, and wood, and river—yea, 
which every shop-window, ornamented, presented. All seemed 
natural, from the twinkling of the stars above us, to the 
monkey of the organ-man in the market-place below. Reader, 
if ever thou hast occasion to go to London, leave it not 
till thou hast seen the Colosseum.</p>
        <p>Mustering our forces to return together, the cry was raised 
“A man a-wanting!” It seems there is an apparatus constructed 
in an apartment leading from the balcony, by which parties 
may, with a great degree of suddenness, be raised or lowered 
from or to the music-room. Our friend, at all times, anxious 
to make the most of a shilling, followed some parties into 
the “ascension-room,” as it is called, and took his seat 
beside them, expecting that on the withdrawal of a curtain 
he should witness something which his companions would miss. 
A bell sounded, and suddenly our expectant found himself 
some twenty feet lower, and obliged to follow the example of 
his co-descendants still further,
<pb id="brown257" n="257"/>
by furnishing the attendant with such a gratuity as became 
an imitator of the Queen Elizabeth.</p>
        <p>To another, but extremely. different, of nature's imitations, 
we now turned our steps. After traversing one or two 
passages, the lights of which became more dim as we advanced, 
we reached a cavern's mouth. Here our progress was arrested 
by an iron grating. Our inquisitive friend, however, soon 
discovered that this obstacle could be removed,—it being, 
in fact, similar to those revolving barriers (we forget the 
name given in the “trade”) placed at the entrance to the 
Great Exhibition. Like them, too, they checked all egress, 
and, to the further astonishment of the man of prying 
propensity, we were soon called upon for so many extra 
sixpences, indicated by this tell-tale gateway as being the 
number of persons who had entered since the keeper left.</p>
        <p>The damp and dripping stones, with their coat of foggy
green,—the exclusion of every sound from without,—
the stunted measure of our speech,—the sharp clank of
our footsteps,—and the frowning gloom of every corner
of this retreat, soon gave evidence of the excellence of
the design and entire structure, in the impression which
it raised that, in reality, we were in some secluded 
rendezvous of smugglers, or of outlaws. Yea, the question
was put by one who had seldom crossed the Cree, Was
Meg Merrilies' one like this? while a party who had explored 
Ben Lomond and its neighborhood was asked if from it there 
could not be formed some notion of that which bears the name 
of the chief, Rob Roy.</p>
        <pb id="brown258" n="258"/>
        <p>Relieved alike from depressing atmosphere and cloudy
thoughts, we retired to a projecting window, from which to 
view the “Swiss cottage,” as it is called. Upon the
verge of a tremendous precipice is seen a lonely cot. All 
communication with it is cut off, save by the rugged trunk 
of a withered tree which spans an opposite projection. Under 
this unstable bridge gush torrents of foaming water, lashed 
down from the heights beyond. Yet morn and eve does an 
industrious peasant leave and return to his romantic home 
across this dangerous way. See now, as he returns from his 
toil, he paces cautiously along; and yonder, at the further 
end, stand wife and little ones waiting to greet him when he 
crosses. O! happy man, to live where thus thou'rt called to 
venture much and oft for those thou lovest, and be as oft 
rewarded by renewed tokens of their affection and most 
tender attachment!</p>
        <p>Through openings in the walls we witnessed, also, the 
representation of mines and manufactures in full operation; 
and then, as we withdrew, we passed through artificial walks 
adorned with every kind of fantastical structure, and at some 
points of which, from the position of reflecting-glasses, we 
viewed in them hundreds of the very objects of which we 
could, with the unaided eye, see but one.</p>

        <p>DURING a sojourn of five years in Europe, I have
spent many pleasant hours in strolling through old
church-yards, and reading the epitaphs upon the 
tombstones of the dead. Part of the pleasure was derived
from a wish for solitude; and no place offers as quiet
walks as a village burial-ground. And the curious 
epitaphs that are to be seen in a church-yard six or eight
hundred years old are enough to cause a smile, even in
so solemn a place as a grave-yard. While walking
through Horsleydown church, in Cumberland, a short
time since, I read an inscription over a tomb which I
copied, and shall give in this chapter, although at the
risk of bringing down upon my devoted head the 
indignation of the fair sex. Domestic enjoyment is often
blasted by an intermixture of foibles with virtues of a
<pb id="brown260" n="260"/>
superior kind; and if the following shall prove a warning 
to wives, I shall be fully compensated for my trouble.</p>

        <p>I HAVE visited few places where I found warmer friends, or 
felt myself more at home, than in Aberdeen. The dwellings, 
being built mostly of granite, remind one of Boston, 
especially in a walk down Union-street, which is thought to 
be one of the finest promenades in Europe. The town is 
situated on a neck of land between the rivers Dee and Don, 
and is the most important commercial place in the north of 
Scotland.</p>
        <p>During our stay in the city we visited, among other places, 
the old bridge of Don, which is not only resorted to owing 
to its antique celebrity and peculiar appearance, but also 
for the notoriety that it has gained by Lord Byron's poem 
for the “Bridge of Don.” His lordship spent several years 
here during his minority, and this old bridge was a favorite 
resort of his. In one of his notes he alludes to how he used 
to hang over its one arch, and the deep black salmon stream 
below, with a
<pb id="brown263" n="263"/>
mixture of childish terror and delight. While we stood
upon the melancholy bridge, and although the scene around 
was severely grand and terrific,—the river swollen, the 
wind howling amongst the leafless trees, the sea in the 
distance,—and although the walk where Hall and Mackintosh 
were wont to melt down hours to moments in high converse was 
in sight, it was, somehow or other, the figure of the mild 
lame boy leaning over the parapet that filled our fancy; and 
the chief fascination of the spot seemed to breathe from the 
genius of the author of “Childe Harold.”</p>
        <p>To Anthony Cruikshank, Esq., whose hospitality we shared in 
Aberdeen, we are indebted for showing us the different 
places of interest in the town and vicinity. An engagement, 
however, to be in Edinburgh, cut short our stay in the north. 
The very mild state of the weather, and a wish to see 
something of the coast between Aberdeen and Edinburgh, 
induced us to make the journey by water. Consequently, after 
delivering a lecture before the Mechanics' Institute, with 
His Honor the Provost in the chair, on the evening of 
February 15th, we went on board the steamer bound for 
Edinburgh. On reaching the vessel we found the drawing-saloon 
almost entirely at our service, and, prejudice against 
color being unknown, we had no difficulty in obtaining the 
best accommodation that the steamer afforded. This was so 
unlike the pro-slavery, negro-hating spirit of America, that 
my colored friends who were with me were almost bewildered
by the transition. The night was a glorious one. The
<pb id="brown264" n="264"/>
sky was cloudless, and the clear, bracing air had a buoyancy 
I have seldom seen. The moon was in its zenith; the steamer 
and surrounding objects were beautiful in the extreme. The 
boat left her moorings at half-past twelve, and we were soon 
out at sea. The “Queen” is a splendid craft, and, without 
the aid of sails, was able to make fifteen miles within the 
hour. I was up the next morning extremely early,—indeed, 
before any of my fellow-passengers,—and found the sea, 
as on the previous night, as calm and as smooth as a mirror.</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“There was no sound upon the deep,</l>
          <l>The breeze lay cradled there;</l>
          <l>The motionless waters sank to sleep</l>
          <l>Beneath the sultry air;</l>
          <l>Out of the cooling brine to leap</l>
          <l>The dolphin scarce would dare.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>It was a delightful morning, more like April than February; 
and the sun, as it rose, seemed to fire every peak of the 
surrounding hills. On our left lay the Island of May, while 
to the right was to be seen the small fishing-town of 
Anstruther, twenty miles distant from Edinburgh. Beyond 
these, on either side, was a range of undulating blue 
mountains, swelling, as they retired, into a bolder outline 
and a loftier altitude, until they terminated some 
twenty-five or thirty miles in the dim distance. A friend at 
my side pointed out a place on the right, where the remains 
of an old castle or look-out house, used in the time of the 
border wars, once
<pb id="brown265" n="265"/>
stood, and which reminded us of the barbarism of the past.</p>
        <p>But these signs are fast disappearing. The plough and roller 
have passed over many of those foundations, and the time will 
soon come when the antiquarian will look in vain for those 
places that history has pointed out to him as connected with 
the political and religious struggles of the past. The 
steward of the vessel came round to see who of the passengers 
wished for breakfast; and as the keen air of the morning had 
given me an appetite, and there being no prejudice on the 
score of color, I took my seat at the table, and gave ample 
evidence that I was not an invalid. On our return to the 
deck again, I found that we had entered the Frith of Forth, 
and that “Modern Athens” was in sight; and far above every 
other object, with its turrets almost lost in the clouds, 
could be seen Edinburgh Castle.</p>
        <p>After landing, and a pleasant ride over one of the finest 
roads in Scotland, with a sprinkling of beautiful villas on 
either side, we were once more at Cannon's Hotel. While in 
the city, on this occasion, we went on the Calton Hill, from 
which we had a delightful view of the place and surrounding 
country.</p>
        <p>I had an opportunity, during my stay in Edinburgh, of 
visiting the Infirmary; and was pleased to see among
the two or three hundred students three colored young
men, seated upon the same benches with those of a fairer 
complexion, and yet there appeared no feeling on the part 
of the whites towards their colored associates, 
<pb id="brown266" n="266"/>
except of companionship and respect. One of the cardinal 
truths, both of religion and freedom, is the equality and 
brotherhood of man. In the sight of God and all just 
institutions, the whites can claim no precedence or privilege 
on account of their being white; and if colored men are not 
treated as they should be in the educational institutions in 
America, it is a pleasure to know that all distinction 
ceases by crossing the broad Atlantic. I had scarcely left 
the lecture-room of the Institute and reached the street, 
when I met a large number of the students on their way to 
the college, and here again were seen colored men arm in arm 
with whites. The proud American who finds himself in the 
splendid streets of Edinburgh, and witnesses such scenes as 
these, can but behold in them the degradation of his own 
country, whose laws would make slaves of these same young 
men, should they appear in the streets of Charleston or New 
Orleans.</p>
        <p>During my stay in Edinburgh I accepted an invitation to 
breakfast with George Combe, Esq., the distinguished 
philosophical phrenologist; and author of “The Constitution 
of Man.” Although not far from seventy years of age, I found 
him apparently as active and as energetic as many men of 
half that number of years. Mr. Combe feels a deep interest 
in the cause of the American slave. I have since become more 
intimately acquainted with him, and am proud to reckon him 
amongst the warmest of my friends. In all of Mr. Combe's 
philanthropic exertions he is ably seconded by his wife, a 
lady of rare endowments, of an attractive 
<pb id="brown267" n="267"/>
person and engaging manners, and whose greatest delight is
in doing good. She took much interest in Ellen Craft,
who formed one of the breakfast party; and was often moved 
to tears on the recital of the thrilling narrative of her 
escape from slavery.</p>

        <p>No one accustomed to pass through Cheapside could fail to 
have noticed a good-looking man, neither black nor white, 
engaged in distributing bills to the thousands who throng 
that part of the city of London. While strolling through 
Cheapside, one morning, I saw, for the fiftieth time, Joseph 
Jenkins, the subject of this chapter, handing out his bills 
to all who would take them as he thrust them into their 
hands. I confess that I was not a little amused, and stood 
for some moments watching and admiring his energy in 
distributing his papers. A few days after, I saw the same 
individual in Chelsea, sweeping a crossing; here, too, he 
was equally as energetic as when I met him in the city. Some 
days later, while going through Kensington, I heard rather a 
sweet, musical voice singing a familiar psalm, and on 
looking round was not a little surprised to find that it was 
the Cheapside bill-distributor and Chelsea crossing-sweeper. 
He was now singing hymns, and selling religious tracts. I
<pb id="brown269" n="269"/>
am fond of patronizing genius, and therefore took one of his 
tracts and paid him for a dozen.</p>
        <p>During the following week, I saw, while going up the
city road, that Shakspeare's tragedy of Othello was to be
performed at the Eagle Saloon that night, and that the
character of the Moor was to be taken by “<hi rend="italics">Selim, an
African prince.</hi>” Having no engagement that evening,
I resolved at once to attend, to witness the performance
of the “African Roscius,” as he was termed on the bills.
It was the same interest that had induced me to go to
the Italian opera to see Madames Sontag and Grisi in
Norma, and to visit Drury Lane to see Macready take
leave of the stage. My expectations were screwed up to
the highest point. The excitement caused by the 
publication of “Uncle Tom's Cabin” had prepared the public
for anything in the African line, and I felt that the
<hi rend="italics">prince</hi> would be sure of a good audience; and in this I
was not disappointed, for, as I took my seat in one of the
boxes near the stage, I saw that the house was crammed
with an orderly company. The curtain was already up
when I entered, and Iago and Roderigo were on the
stage. After a while Othello came in, and was greeted
with thunders of applause, which he very gracefully
acknowledged. Just black enough to take his part with
out coloring his face, and being tall, with a good figure
and an easy carriage, a fine, full and musical voice, he
was well adapted to the character of Othello. I 
immediately recognized in the countenance of the Moor a face
that I had seen before, but could not at the moment tell
<pb id="brown270" n="270"/>
where. Who could this “prince” be, thought I. He
was too black for Douglass, not black enough for Ward,
not tall enough for Garnet, too calm for Delany, figure,
though fine, not genteel enough for Remond. However,
I was soon satisfied as to who the <hi rend="italics">star</hi> was. Reader,
would you think it? it was no less a person than Mr.
Jenkins, the bill-distributor from Cheapside, and 
crossing-sweeper from Chelsea! For my own part, I was 
overwhelmed with amazement, and it was some time before I
could realize the fact. He soon showed that he possessed
great dramatic power and skill; and his description to
the senate of how he won the affections of the gentle
Desdemona stamped him at once as an actor of merit.
“What a pity,” said a lady near me to a gentleman that
was by her side, “that a prince of the royal blood of
Africa should have to go upon the stage for a living! It
it is indeed a shame!” When he came to the scene,
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“O, cursed, cursed slave!—whip me, ye devils, </l><l>From the possession of this heavenly sight! </l><l>Blow me about in winds, roast me in sulphur! </l><l>Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire! </l><l>O, Desdemona Desdemona! dead?</l><l>Dead? O! O! O!”</l></lg></q>
the effect was indeed grand. When the curtain fell, the 
prince was called upon the stage, where he was received 
with deafening shouts of approbation, and a number of 
<hi rend="italics">bouquets</hi> thrown at his feet, which he picked up, bowed, and 
retired. I went into Cheapside the next morning, at an early 
hour, to see if the prince had given up his
<pb id="brown271" n="271"/>
old trade for what I supposed to be a more lucrative one; 
but I found the hero of the previous night at his post,
and giving out his bills as energetically as when I had 
last soon him. Having to go to the provinces for some
months, I lost sight of Mr. Jenkins, and on my return to 
town did not trouble myself to look him up. More than 
a year after I had witnessed the representation of 
Othello at the Eagle, I was walking, one pleasant 
Sabbath evening, through one of the small streets in the 
borough, when I found myself in front of a little chapel, 
where a number of persons were going in. As I was 
passing on slowly, an elderly man said to me, “I suppose 
you have come to hear your colored brother preach.” 
“No,” I answered; “I was not aware that one was to 
be here.” “Yes,” said he; “and a clever man he is, 
too.” As the old man offered to find me a seat, I 
concluded to go in and hear this son of Africa. The room, 
which was not large, was already full. I had to wait 
but a short time before the reverend gentleman made his 
appearance. He was nearly black, and dressed in a black 
suit, with high shirt-collar, and an intellectual-looking 
cravat, that nearly hid his chin. A pair of spectacles 
covered his eyes. The preacher commenced by reading a 
portion of Scripture; and then announced that they would 
sing the twenty-eighth hymn in “the arrangement.” O, that 
voice! I felt sure that I had heard that musical voice 
before; but where, I could not tell. I was not aware that 
any of my countrymen were in London; but felt that, whoever 
he was, he was no
<pb id="brown272" n="272"/>
discredit to the race; for he was a most eloquent and 
accomplished orator. His sermon was against the sale and 
use of intoxicating drinks, and the bad habits of the 
working classes, of whom his audience was composed.</p>
        <p>Although the subject was intensely interesting, I was 
impatient for it to come to a close, for I wanted to speak 
to the preacher. But, the evening being warm, and the room 
heated, the reverend gentleman, on wiping the perspiration 
from his face (which, by the way, ran very freely), took 
off his spectacles on one occasion, so that I immediately 
recognized him, and saved me from going up to the pulpit at 
the end of the service. Yes; it was the bill-distributor of 
Cheapside, the crossing-sweeper of Chelsea, the tract-seller 
and psalm-singer of Kensington, and the Othello of the Eagle
Saloon. I could scarcely keep from laughing right out when 
I discovered this to be the man that I had seen in so many 
characters. As I was about leaving my seat at the close of 
the services, the old man who showed me into the chapel 
asked me if I would not like to be introduced to the 
minister, and I immediately replied that I would. We 
proceeded up the aisle, and met the clergyman as he was 
descending. On seeing me, he did not wait for a formal 
introduction, but put out his hand and said, “I have seen 
you so often, sir, that I seem to know you.” “Yes,” I 
replied; “we have met several times, and under different 
circumstances.” Without saying more, he invited me to walk 
with him towards his home, which was in the direction of my 
own residence. We proceeded; and, during the
<pb id="brown273" n="273"/>
walk, Mr. Jenkins gave me some little account of his early 
history. “You think me rather an odd fish, I presume,” said 
he. “Yes,” I replied. “You are not the only one who thinks 
so,” continued he. “Although I am not as black as some of my 
countrymen, I am a native of Africa. Surrounded by some 
beautiful mountain scenery, and situated between Darfour 
and Abyssinia, two thousand miles in the interior of Africa, 
is a small valley going by the name of Tegla. To that valley I
stretch forth my affections, giving it the endearing 
appellation of my native home and fatherland. It was there 
that I was born, it was there that I received the fond looks 
of a loving mother, and it was there that I set my feet, for 
the first time, upon a world full of cares, trials, 
difficulties and dangers. My father being a farmer, I
used to be sent out to take care of his goats. This service 
I did when I was between seven and eight years of age. As I 
was the eldest of the boys, my pride was raised in no small 
degree when I beheld my father preparing a farm for me. This 
event filled my mind with the grand anticipation of leaving 
the care of the goats to my brother, who was then beginning 
to work a little. While my father was making those 
preparations, I had the constant charge of the goats; and, 
being accompanied by two other boys, who resided near my 
father's house, we wandered many miles from home, by which 
means we acquired a knowledge of the different districts of 
our country. </p>
        <p>“It was while in those rambles with my companions
<pb id="brown274" n="274"/>
that I became the victim of the slave-trader. We were tied 
with cords, and taken to Tegla, and thence to Kordofan, 
which is under the jurisdiction of the Pacha of Egypt. From 
Kordofan I was brought down to Dongola and Korti, in Nubia, 
and from thence down the Nile to Cairo; and, after being 
sold nine times, I became the property of an English 
gentleman, who brought me to this country and put me into 
school. But he died before I finished my education, and his 
family feeling no interest in me, I had to seek a living as 
best I could. I have been employed for some years in 
distributing hand-bills for a barber in Cheapside in the 
morning, go to Chelsea and sweep a crossing in the afternoon, 
and sing psalms and sell religious tracts in the evening. 
Sometimes I have an engagement to perform at some of the 
small theatres, as I had when you saw me at the Eagle. I 
preach for this little congregation over here, and charge 
them nothing; for I want that the poor should have the 
Gospel without money and without price. I have now given up 
distributing bills; I have settled my son in that office. 
My eldest daughter was married about three months ago; and I 
have presented her husband with the Chelsea crossing, as my 
daughter's wedding portion.” “Can he make a living at it?” I 
eagerly inquired. “O, yes! that crossing at Chelsea is worth 
thirty shillings a week, if it is well swept,” said he. 
“But what do you do for a living for yourself?” I asked. “I 
am the leader of a band;” he continued; “and we play for
<pb id="brown275" n="275"/>
balls and parties, and three times a week at the Holborn 
Casino.”</p>
        <p>By this time we had reached a point where we had to part; 
and I left Joseph Jenkins, impressed with the idea that he 
was the greatest genius that I had met in Europe.</p>

        <p>IT was on Tuesday, July 18, 1854, that I set out for Kensall 
Green Cemetery, to attend the inauguration of the monument 
erected to the memory of Thomas Hood, the poet. It was the 
first pleasant day we had had for some time, and the weather 
was exceedingly fine. The company was large, and many 
literary characters wore present. Near the monument sat 
Eliza Cook, author of the “Old Arm Chair,” with her hair cut 
short and parted on one side like a man's. She is short in 
stature, and thick-set, with fair complexion, and bright 
eyes. Not far from Miss Cook was Mrs. Balfour, author of the 
“Working Women of the Last Half-century,” “Morning Dew 
Drops,” etc. etc. Mrs. Balfour is both taller and stouter 
than Miss Cook; and both are about the same age,—not far 
from forty. Murdo Young, Esq., of <hi rend="italics">The Sun</hi>, and George 
Cruikshank, stood near the monument. Horace Mayhew, author 
of “London Labor
<pb id="brown277" n="277"/>
and London Poor,” was by the side of Cruikshank. The Hon. 
Mrs. Milnes sat near Eliza Cook. As the ceremony was about 
to commence, a short, stout man, with dark complexion, and 
black hair, took his stand on a tomb near by; this was R. 
Monckton Milnes, Esq., author of “Poetry for the People,” 
and M.P. for Pontefract. He was the orator of the occasion.</p>
        <p>The monument, which has been ably executed by Mr. Matthew 
Noble, consists of a bronze bust of the poet elevated on a 
pedestal of highly-polished red granite, the whole being 
twelve feet high. In front of the bust are placed wreaths in 
bronze, formed of the laurel, the myrtle, and the <hi rend="italics">immortelle; </hi>
and on a slab beneath the bast appears that well-known line 
of the poet, which he desired should be used as his epitaph:</p>
        <l>“He sang the Song of the Shirt.”</l>
        <p>Upon the front of the pedestal is carved this inscription:
<q type="inscription" direct="unspecified"><l>“In memory of Thomas Hood, born 23d May, 1798; died 3d May, 
1845. Erected by public subscription, A. D. 1854.”</l></q></p>
        <p>At the base of the pedestal a lyre and comic mask in bronze 
are thrown together suggesting the mingled character of 
Hood's writings; whilst on the sides of the pedestal are 
bronze medallions illustrating the poem of “The Bridge of 
Sighs” and “The Dream of Eugene Aram.” The whole design is worthy of the poet and the sculptor, and it is much to the 
honor of the latter 
<pb id="brown278" n="278"/>
that his sympathy with the object has entirely destroyed 
all hope of profit from the work.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milnes was an intimate friend of the poet, and his 
selection as orator was in good taste. He spoke with great 
delicacy and kindness of Hood's personal characteristics, 
and with much taste upon the artistic value of the dead 
humorist's works. He touched with great felicity and subtlety 
upon the value of humor. He defined its province, and showed 
how closely it was connected with the highest forms in which 
genius manifests itself. Mr. Milnes spoke, however, more as 
a friend than as a critic, and his genial utterances excited 
emotions in the hearts of his hearers which told how deep 
was their sympathy both with the orator and the subject of 
his eulogium. There were not many dry eyes amongst his 
hearers when he quoted one or two exquisite portions of 
Hood's poems. It was evident that the greater part of the 
audience were well acquainted with the works of the poet, 
and were delighted to hear the quotations from poems which 
had afforded them exquisite gratification in the perusal.</p>
        <p>Hood was not a merely ephemeral writer. He did not address 
himself to the feelings which more passing events generated 
in the minds of his readers. He smote deep down into the 
hearts of his admirers. Had he been nothing more than a 
literary man, the ceremony on this occasion would have been 
an impertinence. The nation cannot afford to have its time 
taken up by eulogiums on every citizen who does his work 
well in his own particular 
<pb id="brown279" n="279"/>
line. Nevertheless, when a man not only does his own work 
well, but acts powerfully on the national mind, then his 
fame is a national possession, and may be with all propriety 
made the subject of public commemoration. A great author is 
distinguished from the merely professional scribe by the 
fact of adding something to the stock of national ideas. Who 
can tell how much of the national character is due to the 
operation of the works of Shakspeare? The flood of ideas 
with which the great dramatist inundated the national mind 
has enriched it and fertilized it. We are most of us wiser 
and better by the fact of Shakspeare having lived and 
written. It would not be difficult to find in most modern 
works traces of the influence which Shakspeare has exercised 
over the writers. A great author, such as Shakspeare, is, 
then, a great public educator. The national mind is enlarged 
and enriched by the treasures which he pours into it. There 
is, therefore, a great propriety in making such a writer the 
subject of public eulogium.</p>
        <p>Hood was one of those who not only enriched the national 
literature, but instructed the national mind. His 
conceptions, it is true, were not vast. His labors were not, 
like those of Shakspeare, colossal. But he has produced as 
permanent an effect on the nation as many of its legislators.</p>
        <p>Englishmen are wiser and better because Hood has lived. In 
one of his own poems, “The Death-Bed,” how sweetly he sang:</p>
        <pb id="brown280" n="280"/>
        <lg type="verse">
          <lg type="stanza">
            <l>“We watched her breathing through the night, </l>
            <l>Her breathing soft and low,</l>
            <l>As in her breast the wave of life </l>
            <l>Kept heaving to and fro.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg type="stanza">
            <l>“So silently we seemed to speak, </l>
            <l>So slowly moved about,</l>

            <l>To eke her living out.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg type="stanza">
            <l>“Our very hopes belied our fears, </l>
            <l>Our fears our hopes belied;</l>
            <l>We thought her dying when she slept, </l>
            <l>And sleeping when she died.</l>

          <lg type="stanza">
            <l>“For when the morn came dim and sad, </l>
            <l>And chill with early showers,</l>
            <l>Her quiet eyelids closed—she had </l>
            <l>Another morn than ours.”</l>
          </lg>
        </lg>
        <p>Thomas Hood has another morn; may that morn have brightened 
into perfect day! It is well known that the poet died almost 
on the verge of starvation. Being seized, long before his 
death, with a malady that kept him confined to his bed the 
greater part of the time, he became much embarrassed. Still, 
in defiance of anguish and weakness, he toiled on, until 
nature could endure no more. Many of Hood's humorous pieces 
were written upon a sick bed, and taken out and sold to the 
publishers, that his family might have bread. Little did 
those who laughed over these comical sayings think of the 
pain that it cost the poet to write them. And, now that he is
gone, we often hear some one say, “<hi rend="italics">Poor Hood!</hi>” But
<pb id="brown281" n="281"/>
peace to his ashes! He now lies in the finest cemetery in 
the world, and in one of its greenest spots. At the close 
of the inauguration, a rush was made to get a view of 
Eliza Cook, as being the next great novelty after the 
monument, if not its equal.</p>

He takes a deep interest in the Eastern question, and 
censures the government for their want of energy in the 
present war.</p>
        <p>Not far from Layard you see the large frame and dusky visage 
of Joseph Hume. He was the son of a poor woman who sold 
apples in the streets of London. Mr. Hume spent his younger 
days in India, where he made a fortune; and then returned to 
England, and was elected a member of the House of Commons, 
where he has been ever since, with the exception of five or 
six years. He began political life as a tory, but soon went 
over to radicalism. He is a great financial reformer, and 
has originated many of the best measures of a practical 
character that have been passed in Parliament during the last 
thirty years. He is seventy-five years old, but still full 
of life and activity—capable of great endurance and 
incessant labor. No man enjoys to an equal extent the 
respect and confidence of the legislature. Though his 
opinions are called extreme, he contents himself with 
realizing, for the present, the good that is attainable. He 
is emphatically a progressive reformer; and the father of 
the House of Commons.</p>
        <p>To the left of Mr. Hume you see a slim, thin-faced man, with 
spectacles, an anxious countenance, his hat on
<pb id="brown284" n="284"/>
another seat before him, and in it a large paper rolled up. 
That is Edward Miall. He was educated for the Baptist 
ministry, and was called when very young to be a pastor. He 
relinquished his charge to become the conductor of a paper 
devoted to the abolition of the state church, and the 
complete political enfranchisement of the people. He made 
several unsuccessful attempts to go into Parliament, and at 
last succeeded Thomas Crawford in the representation of 
Rochdale, where in 1852 he was elected free of expense. He 
is one of the most democratic members of the legislature. 
Miall is an able writer and speaker—a very close and 
correct reasoner. He stands at the very head of the 
Nonconformist party in Great Britain; and <hi rend="italics">The Nonconformist</hi>, 
of which he is editor, is the most radical journal in the 
United Kingdom.</p>
        <p>Look at that short, thick-set man, with his hair parted on 
the crown of his head, a high and expansive forehead, and an 
uncommon bright eye. That is William Johnson Fox. He was a 
working weaver at Norwich; then went to Holton College, 
London, to be educated for the Orthodox Congregational 
ministry; afterwards embraced Unitarian views. He was invited 
to Finsbury Chapel, where for many years he lectured weekly 
upon a wide range of subjects, embracing literature, 
political science, theology, government and social economy. 
He is the writer of the articles signed “Publicola,” in the 
<hi rend="italics">Weekly Dispatch</hi>, a democratic newspaper. He has retired from 
his pulpit occupations, and supports himself exclusively by 
his pen, in connection with the liberal journals of the
<pb id="brown285" n="285"/>
metropolis. Mr. Fox is a witty and vigorous writer, an 
animated and brilliant orator.</p>
        <p>Yonder, on the right of us, sits Richard Cobden. Look
at his thin, pale face, and spare-made frame. He started
as a commercial traveller; was afterwards a calico-printer
and merchant in Manchester. He was the expounder, in
the Manchester Chamber of Commerce and in the town
council, of the principles of free trade. In the council
of the Anti-Corn-Law League, he was the leader, and
principal agitator of the question in public meetings
throughout the kingdom. He was first elected for Stockport. 
When Sir Robert Peel's administration abolished the 
corn-laws, the prime minister avowed in the House of Commons 
that the great measure was in most part achieved by the 
unadorned eloquence of Richard Cobden. He is the 
representative of the non-intervention or political peace 
party; holding the right and duty of national defence, but 
opposing all alliances which are calculated to embroil the 
country in the affairs of other nations. His age is about 
fifty. He represents the largest constituency in the 
kingdom—the western division of Yorkshire, which contains 
thirty-seven thousand voters. Mr. Cobden has a reflective 
cast of mind; and is severely logical in his style, and very 
lucid in the treatment of his subjects. He may be termed the 
leader of the radical party in the House.</p>
        <p>Three seats from Cobden you see that short, stout person, 
with his high head, large, round face, good-sized eyes. It 
is Macaulay, the poet, critic, historian and statesman.
<pb id="brown286" n="286"/>
If you have not read his Essay on Milton, you should do so 
immediately; it is the finest thing of the kind in the 
language. Then there is his criticism on the Rev. R. 
Montgomery. Macaulay will never be forgiven by the divine 
for that onslaught upon his poetical reputation. That review 
did more to keep the reverend poet's works on the publisher's 
shelves than all other criticisms combined. Macaulay 
represents the city of Edinburgh.</p>
        <p>Look at that tall man, apparently near seventy, with front 
teeth gone. That is Joseph Brotherton, the member for 
Salford. He has represented that constituency ever since 
1832. He has always been a consistent liberal, and is a man 
of business. He is no orator, and seldom speaks, unless in 
favor of the adjournment of the House when the hour of 
midnight has arrived. At the commencement of every new 
session of Parliament he prepares a resolution that no 
business shall be entered upon after the hour of twelve at 
night, but has never been able to carry it. He is a 
teetotaller and a vegetarian, a member of the Peace Society, 
and a preacher in the small religious society to which he 
belongs.</p>
        <p>In a seat behind Brotherton you see a young-looking man, 
with neat figure, white vest, frilled shirt, with gold 
studs, gold breast-pin, a gold chain round the neck, white 
kid glove on the right hand, the left bare with the 
exception of two gold rings. It is Samuel Morton Peto. He is 
of humble origin—has made a vast fortune as a builder 
and contractor for docks and railways. He is a Baptist, and 
contributes very largely to his own and
<pb id="brown287" n="287"/>
other dissenting denominations. He has built several Baptist 
chapels in London and elsewhere. His appearance is that of a 
gentleman; and his style of speaking, though not elegant, yet 
pleasing.</p>
        <p>Over on the same side with the liberals sits John Bright, 
the Quaker statesman, and leader of the Manchester school. 
He is the son of a Rochdale manufacturer, and first 
distinguished himself as an agitator in favor of the repeal 
of the corn-laws. He represents the city of Manchester, and 
has risen very rapidly. Mr. Cobden and he invariably act 
together, and will, doubtless, sooner or later, come into 
power together. Look at his robust and powerful frame, round 
and pleasing face. He is but little more than forty; an 
earnest and eloquent speaker, and commands the fixed 
attention of his audience.</p>
        <p>See that exceedingly good-looking man just taking his seat. 
It is William Ewart Gladstone. He is the son of a Liverpool 
merchant, and represents the University of Oxford. He came 
into Parliament in 1832, under the auspices of the tory Duke 
of Newcastle. He was a disciple of the first Sir R. Peel, 
and was by that statesman introduced into official life. He 
has been Vice-president and President of the Board of Trade, 
and is now Chancellor of the Exchequer. Mr. Gladstone is 
only forty-four. When not engaged in speaking he is of rather 
unprepossessing appearance. His forehead appears low, but 
his eye is bright and penetrating. He is one of the ablest 
debaters in the House, and is master
<pb id="brown288" n="288"/>
of a style of eloquence in which he is quite unapproached. 
As a reasoner he is subtle, and occasionally jesuitical; 
but, with a good cause and a conviction of the right, he 
rises to a lofty pitch of oratory, and may be termed the 
Wendell Phillips of the House of Commons.</p>
        <p>There sits Disraeli, amongst the tories. Look at that Jewish 
face, those dark ringlets hanging round that marble brow. 
When on his feet he has a cat-like, stealthy step; always 
looks on the ground when walking. He is the son of the 
well-known author of the “Curiosities of Literature.” His 
ancestors were Venetian Jews. He was himself born a Jew, and 
was initiated into the Hebrew faith. Subsequently he embraced 
Christianity. His literary works are numerous, consisting 
entirely of novels, with the exception of a biography of the 
late Lord George Bentinck, the leader of the protectionist 
party, to whose post Mr. Disraeli succeeded on the death of 
his friend and political chief. Mr. Disraeli has been all 
round the compass in politics. He is now professedly a 
conservative, but is believed to be willing to support any 
measures, however sweeping and democratical, if by so doing 
he could gratify his ambition—which is for office and 
power. He was the great thorn in the side of the late Sir R. 
Peel, and was never so much at home as when he could find a 
flaw in that distinguished statesman's political acts. He is 
an able debater and a finished orator, and in his speeches 
wrings applause even from his political opponents.</p>
        <p>Cast your eyes to the opposite side of the House, and
<pb id="brown289" n="289"/>
take a good view of that venerable man, full of years, just 
rising from his seat. See how erect he stands; he is above 
seventy years of age, and yet he does not seem to be forty. 
That is Lord Palmerston. Next to Joseph Hume, he is the 
oldest member in the House. He has been longer in office 
than any other living man. All parties have, by turns, 
claimed him, and he has belonged to all kinds of 
administrations; tory, conservative, whig, and coalition. He 
is a ready debater, and is a general favorite, as a speaker, 
for his wit and adroitness, but little trusted by any party 
as a statesman. His talents have secured him office, as he 
is useful as a minister, and dangerous as an opponent.</p>
        <p>That is Lord Dudley Cutts Stuart speaking to Mr. Ewart. His 
lordship represents the populous and wealthy division of the 
district of Marylebone. He is a radical, the warm friend of 
the cause of Poland, Hungary and Turkey. He speaks often, 
but always with a degree of hesitation which makes it 
painful to listen to him. His solid frame, strongly-marked 
features, and unmercifully long eye-brows are in strange 
contrast to the delicate face of Mr. Ewart.</p>
        <p>The latter is the representative for Dumfries, a Scotch 
borough. He belongs to a wealthy family, that has made its 
fortune by commerce. Mr. Ewart is a radical, a <sic corr="staunch">stanch</sic> 
advocate of the abolition of capital punishment, and a 
strenuous supporter of all measures for the intellectual 
improvement of the people.</p>
        <p>Ah! we shall now have a speech. See that little man 
<pb id="brown290" n="290"/>
rising from his seat; look at his thin black hair, how it 
seems to stand up; hear that weak, but distinct voice. O, 
how he repeats the ends of his sentences! It is Lord John 
Russell, the leader of the present administration. He is 
now asking for three million pounds sterling to carry on the 
war. He is a terse and perspicuous speaker, but avoids 
prolixity. He is much respected on both sides of the House. 
Though favorable to reform measures generally, he is 
nevertheless an upholder of aristocracy, and stands at the 
head and firmly by his order. He is brother to the present 
Duke of Bedford, and has twice been Premier; and, though on 
the sunny side of sixty, he has been in office, at different 
times, more than thirty years. He is a constitutional whig 
and conservative reformer. See how earnestly he speaks, and 
keeps his eyes on Disraeli! He is afraid of the Jew. Now he 
scratches the bald place on his head, and then opens that 
huge roll of paper, and looks over towards Lord Palmerston.</p>
        <p>That full-faced, well-built man, with handsome countenance, 
just behind him, is Sir Joshua Walmesley. He is about the 
same age of Lord John; and is the representative for 
Leicester. He is a native of Liverpool, where for some years 
he was a poor teacher, but afterwards became wealthy in the 
corn trade. When mayor of his native town, he was knighted. 
He is a radical reformer, and always votes on the right side.</p>
        <p>Lord John Russell has finished and taken his seat. Joseph 
Hume is up. He goes into figures; he is the arithmetician of 
the House of Commons. Mr. Hume is
<pb id="brown291" n="291"/>
in the Commons what James N. Buffum is in our Anti-Slavery 
meetings, the <hi rend="italics">man of facts</hi>. Watch the old man's eye as he 
looks over his papers. He is of no religious faith, and said, 
a short time since, that the world would be better off if 
all creeds were swept into the Thames. His motto is that of 
Pope:</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“For modes of faith let graceless zealots fight:</l>
          <l>His can't be wrong whose life is in the right.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Mr. Hume has not been tedious; he is done. Now for Disraeli. 
He is going to pick Lord John's speech to pieces, and he can 
do it better than any other man in the House. See how his 
ringlets shake as he gesticulates! and that sarcastic smile! 
He thinks the government has not been vigorous enough in its 
prosecution of the war. He finds fault with the inactivity 
of the Baltic fleet; the allied army has made no movement to 
suit him. The Jew looks over towards Lord John, and then 
makes a good hit. Lord John shakes his head; Disraeli has 
touched a tender point, and he smiles as the minister turns 
on his seat. The Jew is delighted beyond measure. “The Noble 
Lord shakes his head; am I to understand that he did not 
say what I have just repeated?” Lord John: “The Right Hon. 
Gentleman is mistaken; I did not say what he has attributed 
to me.” Disraeli: “I am glad that the Noble Lord has denied 
what I thought he had said.” An attack is made on another 
part of the minister's speech. Lord John shakes his head 
again. “Does the Noble Lord deny that, too?” Lord John: “No, 
I don't, but your criticism is unjust.”
<pb id="brown292" n="292"/>
Disraeli smiles again: he has the minister in his hands, and 
he shakes him well before he lots him go. What cares he for 
justice? Criticism is his forte; it was that that made him 
what he is in the House. The Jew concludes his speech amid 
considerable applause.</p>
        <p>All eyes are turned towards the seat of the Chancellor of the 
Exchequer: a pause of a moment's duration, and the orator of 
the House rises to his feet. Those who have been reading <hi rend="italics">The 
Times</hi> lay it down; all whispering stops, and the attention 
of the members is directed to Gladstone, as he begins. 
Disraeli rests his chin upon his hat, which lies upon his 
knee: he too is chained to his seat by the fascinating 
eloquence of the man of letters. Thunders of applause follow, 
in which all join but the Jew. Disraeli changes his position 
on his seat, first one leg crossed, and then the other, but 
he never smiles while his opponent is speaking. He sits like 
one of those marble figures in the British Museum. Disraeli 
has furnished more fun for <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi> than any other man in the 
empire. When it was resolved to have a portrait of the late 
Sir R. Peel painted for the government, Mr. Gladstone 
ordered it to be taken from one that appeared in <hi rend="italics">Punch</hi> 
during the lifetime of that great statesman. This was indeed 
a compliment to the sheet of fun. But now look at the 
Chancellor of the Exchequer. He is in the midst of his 
masterly speech, and silence reigns throughout the House.</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“His words of learned length and thundering sound </l>
          <l>Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around;</l>
          <pb id="brown293" n="293"/>
          <l>And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew</l>
          <l>That one small head could carry all he knew.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Let us turn for a moment to the gallery in which we are 
seated. It is now near the hour of twelve at night. The 
question before the House is an interesting one, and has 
called together many distinguished persons as visitors.
There sits the Hon. and Rev. Baptist W. Noel. He is one of 
the first of the Nonconformist ministers in the kingdom. He 
is about fifty years of age; very tall, and stands erect; has 
a fine figure, complexion fair, face long and rather pale, 
eyes blue and deeply set. He looks every inch the gentleman. 
Near by Mr. Noel you see the Rev. John Cumming, D.D. We stood 
more than an hour last Sunday in his chapel in Crown-court to 
hear him preach; and such a sermon we have seldom ever 
heard. Dr. Cumming does not look old. He has rather a bronzed 
complexion, with dark hair, eyes covered with spectacles. He 
is an eloquent man, and seems to be on good terms with 
himself. He is the most ultra Protestant we have ever heard, 
and hates Rome with a perfect vengeance. Few men are more 
popular in an Exeter Hall meeting than Dr. Cumming. He is a 
most prolific writer; scarce a month passes by without 
something from his pen. But they are mostly works of a 
sectarian character, and cannot be of long or of lasting 
reputation.</p>
        <p>Further along sits a man still more eloquent than Dr. 
Cumming. He is of dark complexion, black hair, light blue 
eyes, an intellectual countenance, and when standing
<pb id="brown294" n="294"/>
looks tall. It is the Rev. Henry Melville. He is considered 
the finest preacher in the Church of England. There, too, is 
Washington Wilks, Esq., author of “The Half-century.” His 
face is so covered with beard that I will not attempt a 
description; it may, however, be said that he has literally 
entered into the <hi rend="italics">Beard Movement.</hi></p>
        <p>Come, it is time for us to leave the House of Commons. Stop 
a moment! Ah! there is one that I have not pointed out to 
you. Yonder he sits amongst the tories. It is Sir Edward 
Bulwer Lytton, the renowned novelist. Look at his trim, neat 
figure; his hair done up in the most approved manner; his 
clothes cut in the latest fashion. He has been in Parliament 
twenty-five years. Until the abolition of the corn-laws, he 
was a liberal; but as a land-owner he was opposed to free 
trade, and joined the protectionists. He has two 
country-seats, and lives in a style of oriental magnificence 
that is not equalled by any other man in the kingdom; and 
often gathers around him the brightest spirits of the age, 
and presses them into the service of his private theatre, of 
which he is very fond. In the House of Commons he is seldom 
heard, but is always listened to with profound attention 
when he rises to speak. He labors under the disadvantage of 
partial deafness. He is undoubtedly a man of refined taste, 
and pays a greater attention to the art of dress than any 
other public character I have ever seen. He has a splendid 
fortune, and his income from the labors of his pen is very 
great. His
<pb id="brown295" n="295"/>
title was given to him by the queen, and his rank as a 
baronet he owes to his high literary attainments. Now take a 
farewell view of this assembly of senators. You may go to 
other climes, and look upon the representatives of other 
nations, but you will never see the like again.</p>

        <p>THE anniversary of West India emancipation was celebrated 
here on Monday last. But little notice of the intended 
meeting had been given, yet the capacious lecture-room of 
St. Martin's Hall was filled at an early hour with a most 
respectable audience, who appeared to have assembled for the 
sake of the cause.</p>
        <p>Our old and well-tried friend, Geo. Thompson, Esq., was 
unanimously called to preside, and be opened the proceedings 
with one of his characteristic speeches. The meeting was then 
addressed by the Rev. Wm. Douglass, a colored clergyman of 
Philadelphia, in a most eloquent and feeling manner. Mr. 
Douglass is a man of fine native talent.</p>
        <p>Francis W. Kellogg, of the United States, was the next 
speaker. Mr. Kellogg is an advocate of temperance, of some 
note, I believe, in his own country, and has been lecturing 
with considerable success in Great
<pb id="brown297" n="297"/>
Britain. He is one of the most peculiar speakers I have ever 
heard. Born in Massachusetts, and brought up in the West, he 
has the intelligence of the one and the roughness of the 
other. He has the retentive memory of Wendell Phillips, the 
overpowering voice of Frederick Douglass, and the too rapid 
gestures of Dr. Delany. He speaks faster than any man I ever 
heard, except C. C. Burleigh. His speech, which lasted more 
than an hour, was one stream of fervid eloquence. He gave 
the audience a better idea of a real American stump orator 
than they ever had before. Altogether, he is the best 
specimen of the rough material out of which great public 
speakers are manufactured that I have yet seen. Mr. Kellogg's 
denunciations of Clay and Webster (the dead lion and the 
living dog) reminded us of Wendell Phillips; his pictures of 
slavery called to memory Frederick Douglass in his palmiest 
days; and his rebuke of his own countrymen for their 
unchristian prejudice against color brought before us the 
favorite topic and best speeches of C. L. Remond. It was his 
maiden speech on the subject of slavery, yet it was the 
speech of the evening.</p>
        <p>Hatred to oppression is so instilled into the minds of 
the people in Great Britain, that it needs but little to 
arouse their enthusiasm to its highest point; yet they can 
scarcely comprehend the real condition of the slaves of the 
United States. They have heard of the buying and selling of 
men, women and children, without any regard to the tenderest 
ties of nature; of the passage and execution of the infamous 
Fugitive Slave Law; and, as we
<pb id="brown298" n="298"/>
walk through the streets of London, they occasionally
meet an American slave, who reminds them of the fact that 
while their countrymen are boasting of their liberty,
and offering an asylum to the exiled of other countries,
they refuse it to their own citizens.</p>
        <p>Much regret has been expressed on this side of the Atlantic 
that Kossuth should have kept so silent on the slavery 
question while in America; and this act alone has, to a 
great extent, neutralized his further operations in this 
country. He certainly is not the man now that he was before 
his visit to the New World.</p>
        <p>I seldom pass through the Strand, or other great 
thoroughfares of the metropolis, without meeting countrymen 
of mine. I encountered one, a short time since, under 
peculiar circumstances. It was one of those days commonly 
experienced in London, of half cloud and half sunshine, with 
just fog enough to give everything a gray appearance, that I 
was loitering through Drury Lane, and came upon a crowd of 
poor people and street beggars, who were being edified by an 
exhibition of Punch and Judy, on the one hand, and an 
organ-grinder, with a well-dressed and intelligent-looking 
monkey, on the other. Punch looked happy, and was performing 
with great alacrity, while the organ-grinder, with his 
loud-toned instrument, was furnishing music for the million. 
Pushing my way through the crowd, and taking the middle of 
the street for convenience' sake, I was leaving the infected 
district in greater haste than I entered it. I had scarcely 
taken my eyes off the motley
<pb id="brown299" n="299"/>
group, when I observed a figure approaching me from the 
opposite direction, and walking with a somewhat hasty step. 
I have seen so much oddity in dress, and the general 
appearance of members of the human family, that my attention 
is seldom ever attracted by the uncivilized look of any one. 
But this being whom I was meeting, and whose appearance was 
such as I had not seen before, threw the monkey and his 
companions entirely in the shade. In fact, all that I had 
beheld in the Great Exhibition, of a ludicrous nature, 
dwindled away into utter insignificance when compared to 
this Robinson Crusoe looking man; for, after all, it turned 
out to be a man. He was of small stature, and, although not 
a cold day, his person was enveloped in a heavy over-coat, 
which looked as if it had seen some service, and had passed 
through the hands of some of the second-hand gentlemen of 
Brattle-street, Boston. The trousers I did not see, as they 
were benevolently covered by the long skirts of the above 
garment. A pair of patent-leather boots covered a small 
foot. The face was entirely hidden by a huge beard, 
apparently from ten to fifteen inches in length, and of a 
reddish color. Long, dark hair joined the beard, and upon 
the head was thrown, in a careless manner, one of those hats 
known in America as the wide-awake, but here as the 
billy-cock. A pair of bright eyes were entirely hid by the 
hair around the face. I was not more attracted by his 
appearance than astonished at the man's stopping before me, 
as if he knew me. I now observed something like smoke 
emanating from the long
<pb id="brown300" n="300"/>
beard round the mouth. I was immediately seized by the 
individual by his right hand, while the left hand took from 
his mouth a pipe about three inches in length, stem included, 
and, in a sharp, shrill voice, sounding as if it came from 
the interior of a hogshead or from a sepulchre, he called me 
by my name. I stood for a moment and eyed the figure from 
head to foot, “from top to toe,” to see if I could discover 
the resemblance of any one I had ever seen before. After 
satisfying myself that the object was now, I said, “Sir, you 
have the advantage of me.” “Don't you know me?” he exclaimed, 
in a still louder voice. I looked again, and shook my head. 
“Why,” said he, it is C——.” I stepped back a few feet, and
viewed him once more from top to bottom, and replied, “You 
don't mean to say that this is H. C——?” “Yes, it is he, 
and nobody else.” After taking another look, I said, “An't 
you mistaken, sir, about this being H. C——?” “No,” said 
he, “I am sure I know myself.” So I very reluctantly had to 
admit that I was standing in presence of the ex-editor of 
the “L. P. and H. of F.” Indeed, one meets with strange faces 
in a walk through the streets of London. But I must turn 
again to the question of slavery.</p>
        <p>Some months since a lady, apparently not more than fifty 
years of age, entered a small dwelling on the estate of the 
Earl of Lovelace, situated in the county of Surrey. After 
ascending a flight of stairs, and passing through a narrow 
passage, she found herself in a small but neat room, with 
plain furniture. On the table lay copies of
<pb id="brown301" n="301"/>
the<hi rend="italics"> Liberator</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Frederick Douglass' Paper.</hi> Near the window 
sat a young woman, busily engaged in sewing, with a 
spelling-book laying open on her lap. The light step of the 
stranger had not broken the silence enough to announce the 
approach of any one, and the young woman still sat at her 
task, unconscious that any one was near. A moment or two, 
and the lady was observed, when the diligent student hastily 
rose, and apologized for her apparent inattention. The 
stranger was soon seated, and in conversation with the young 
woman. The lady had often heard the word “slave,” and knew
something of its application, but had never before seen
one of her own sex who had actually been born and brought up 
in a state of chattel slavery; and the one in whose company 
she now <sic corr="was">was was</sic> so white, and had so much the appearance of 
an educated and well-bred lady, that she could scarcely 
realize that she was in the presence of an American slave. 
For more than an hour the illustrious lady and the poor 
exile sat and carried on a most familiar conversation. The 
thrilling story of the fugitive often brought tears to the 
eyes of the stranger. O, how I would that every half-bred, 
aristocratic, slave-holding, woman-whipping, negro-hating 
woman of America could have been present and heard what passed
between these two distinguished persons! They would,
for once, have seen one who, though moving in the most
elevated and aristocratic society in Europe, felt it an
honor to enter the small cottage and take a seat by the
side of a poor, hunted and exiled American fugitive slave.

Let it be rung in the ears of the thin-skinned aristocracy of 
the United States, who would rather receive a flogging from 
the cat-o'-nine-tails than to sit at the table of a negro, 
that Lady Noel Byron, widow of the great poet, felt it a 
peculiar pleasure to sit at the table and take tea with 
Ellen Craft. It must, indeed, be an interesting fact to the 
reader, and especially to those who are acquainted with the 
facts connected with the life and escape of William and Ellen 
Craft, to know that they are industrious students in a 
school, and attracting the attention of persons occupying 
the most influential positions in society. The wonderful 
escape of William and Ellen Craft is still fresh in the 
minds of all who take an interest in the cause of humanity; 
and their eluding the pursuit of the slave-hunters at 
Boston, and final escape from the Athens of the New World, 
will not be soon forgotten.</p>
        <p>Every American should feel a degree of humiliation when the 
thought occurs to him that there is not a foot of soil over 
which the <hi rend="italics">Stars and Stripes</hi> wave upon which Ellen Craft can 
stand and be protected by the constitution or laws of the 
country. Yet Ellen Craft is as white as most white women. 
Had she escaped from Austrian tyranny, and landed on the 
shores of America, her reception would have been scarcely 
less enthusiastic than that which greeted the arrival of 
Jenny Lind. But Ellen Craft had the misfortune to be born in 
one of the Slave States of the American Union, and that was 
enough to cause her to be driven into <hi rend="italics">exile</hi> for daring to 
escape from American despotism.</p>

        <p>WHAT a change five years make in one's history! The summer of 
1849 found me a stranger in a foreign land, unknown to its 
inhabitants; its laws, customs and history, were a blank to 
me. But how different the summer of 1854! During my sojourn 
I had travelled over nearly every railroad in England and 
Scotland, and had visited Ireland and Wales, besides spending 
some weeks on the continent. I had become so well acquainted 
with the British people and their history, that I had begun 
to fancy myself an Englishman by habit, if not by birth. The 
treatment which I had experienced at their hands had endeared 
them to me, and caused me to feel myself at home wherever I 
went. Under such circumstances, it was not strange that I 
commenced with palpitating heart the preparation to return to 
my <hi rend="italics">native land</hi>. Native land! How harshly that word sounds to 
my ears! True, America was the land of my birth; my 
<pb id="brown304" n="304"/>
grandfather had taken part in her Revolution, had enriched 
the soil with his blood, yet upon this, soil I had been 
worked as a slave. I seem still to hear the sound of the 
auctioneer's rough voice, as I stood on the block in the
slave-market at St. Louis. I shall never forget the 
savage grin with which he welcomed a higher bid, when he
thought that he had received the last offer. I had seen a 
mother sold and taken to the cotton-fields of the far South; 
three brothers had been bartered to the soul-driver in my 
presence; a dear sister had been sold to the negro-dealer, 
and driven away by him; I had seen the rusty chains fastened 
upon her delicate wrists; the whip had been applied to my 
own person, and the marks of the brutal driver's lash were 
still on my body. Yet this was my native land, and to this 
land was I about to embark.</p>
        <p>In Edinburgh, I had become acquainted with the Wighams; in 
Glasgow, the Patens and Smeals; in Manchester, the Langdons; 
in Newcastle, the Mawsons and Richardsons. To Miss Ellen 
Richardson, of this place, I was mainly indebted for the 
redemption of my body from slaver and the privilege of again 
returning to my native country. I had also met, and become 
acquainted with, John Bishop Estlin, Esq., of Bristol, and 
his kindhearted and accomplished daughter. Of the hundreds 
of British Abolitionists with whom I had the pleasure of 
shaking hands while abroad, I know of none whose hearts beat 
more fervently for the emancipation of the American slave 
than Mr. Estlin's. He is indeed a model 
<pb id="brown305" n="305"/>
Christian. His house, his heart and his purse, were always 
open to the needy, without any regard to sect, color or 
country. When those distinguished fugitive slaves, William 
and Ellen Craft, arrived in England, unknown and without 
friends, Mr. Estlin wrote to me and said, “If the Crafts are 
in want, send to me. If you cannot find a home for them, let 
them come to Bristol, and I will keep them, at my expense, 
until something better turns up.” And nobly did he keep his 
word. He put the two fugitives in school, and saw that they 
did not want for the means of support. I have known him to 
keep concealed what he had given to benevolent objects. To 
Mr. Estlin I am indebted for many acts of kindness; and now 
that the broad Atlantic lies between us, and in all 
probability we shall never again meet on earth, it is with 
heartfelt gratitude and pleasure that I make this mention of 
him.</p>
        <p>And last, though not the least, I had become intimate with 
that most generous-hearted philanthropist, George Thompson, 
who never feels so well as when giving a welcome to an 
American fugitive slave. I had spent hours at the hospitable 
firesides of Harriet Martineau, R. D. Webb, and other 
distinguished authors. You will not, reader, think it strange 
that my heart became sad at the thought of leaving all these 
dear friends, to return to a country in which I had spent 
some of the best days of my life as a slave, and where I 
knew that prejudice would greet me on my arrival.</p>
        <p>Most of the time I had resided in London. Its streets, 
<pb id="brown306" n="306"/>
parks, public buildings and its fog, had become “as
familiar as household words.” I had heard the deep,
bass voice of the Bishop of London, in St. Paul's 
Cathedral. I had sat in Westminster Abbey, until I had lost
all interest in the services, and then wandered about
amongst the monuments, reading the epitaphs placed
over the dead. Like others, I had been locked in the
Temple Church, and compelled to wait till service was
over, whether I liked it or not. I had spent days in the
British Museum and National Gallery, and in all these
I had been treated as a man. The “negro pew,” which
I had seen in the churches of America, was not to be
found in the churches of London. There, too, were my
daughters. They who had been denied education upon
equal terms with children of a fairer complexion, in the
United States, had been received in the London schools
upon terms of perfect equality. They had accompanied
me to most of the noted places in the metropolis. We
had strolled through Regent-street, the Strand, 
Piccadilly and Oxford-street, so often, that sorrow came over
me as the thought occurred to me that I should never
behold them again.</p>
        <p>Then the English manner of calling on friends before one's 
departure. I can meet an enemy with pleasure, but it is with 
regret that I part with a friend. As the time for me to 
leave drew near, I felt more clearly my identity with the 
English people. By and by the last hour arrived that I was 
to spend in London. The cab stood at the door, with my trunks 
on its top; and, 
<pb id="brown307" n="307"/>
bidding the household “good-by,” I entered the vehicle,
the driver raised his whip, and I looked for the last time 
on my old home in Cecil-street. As we turned into the Strand, 
Nelson's monument, in Trafalgar-square, greeted me on the 
left, and Somerset House on the right. I took a farewell 
look at Covent Garden Market, through whose walks I had often 
passed, and where I had spent many pleasant hours. My 
youngest daughter was in France, but the eldest met me at 
the dépôt, and after a few moments the bell rang, and away we 
went.</p>
        <p>As the train was leaving the great metropolis of the world 
behind, I caught a last view of the dome of St. Paul's, and 
the old pile of Westminster Abbey.</p>
        <p>In every town through which we passed on our way to 
Liverpool I could call to mind the name of some one whose 
acquaintance I had made, and whose hospitality I had shared. 
The steamer City of Manchester had her fires kindled when we 
arrived, and we went immediately on board. We found one 
hundred and seventy-five passengers in the cabin, and above 
five hundred in the steerage. After some delay, the ship 
weighed anchor, the machinery was put in motion, and, bidding 
Liverpool a long farewell, the vessel moved down the Mersey, 
and was in a short time out at sea. The steam tender 
accompanied the ship about thirty miles, during which time 
search was made throughout the Manchester to see that no 
“stow-aways” were on board. No vessel ever leaves an English 
port without some one trying to get his passage out without 
pay. When the crew are at work, or
<pb id="brown308" n="308"/>
not on the watch, these persons come on board, hide
themselves under the berths in the steerage cabin, or
amongst the freight, until the vessel is out to sea, and
then they come out. As they are always poor persons,
without either baggage or money, they succeed in 
getting their passage without giving anything in return. As
the tender was about quitting us to return to Liverpool,
it came along-side to take on board those who had come
with the vessel to see their friends off. Any number of
white napkins were called into requisition, as friends
were shaking hands with each other, and renewing their
promises to write by the first post. One young man
had come out to spend a few more hours with a 
handsome Scotch lass, with whom he, no doubt, had a 
matrimonial engagement. Another, an English lady, seemed
much affected when the last bell of the tender rung, and
the captain cried “All on board.” Having no one to
look after, I found time to survey others. The tender let
go her cables amid three hearty cheers, and a deafening
salute from the two-pounder on board the City of 
Manchester. A moment more, and the two steamers were
leaving each other with rapid speed. The two young
ladies of whom I have already made mention, together
with many others, had their faces buried in their 
handkerchiefs, and appeared to be dying with grief. 
However, all of them seemed to get over it very soon. On
the second day out at sea I saw the young English lady
walking the quarter-deck with a fine-looking gentleman,
and holding as tightly to his arm as if she had left no
<pb id="brown309" n="309"/>
one behind; and as for the Scotch lass, she was seated on a 
settee with a countryman of hers, who had made her 
acquaintance on board, and, from all appearance, had 
entirely forgotten her first love. Such is the waywardness 
of man and woman, and the unfaithfulness of the human heart.</p>
        <p>In the latter part of the second day a storm overtook us, and 
for the ten succeeding days we scarcely knew whether we were 
on our heads or our heels. The severest part of the gale was 
on the eighth and ninth nights out. On one of those evenings 
a fellow-roommate came in and said, “If you wish to see a 
little fun, go into the forward steerage.” It was about 
eight o'clock, and most of the passengers were either in bed, 
or preparing for the night's rest, such as is to be had on 
board a ship in a gale of wind. This cabin contained about 
two hundred and fifty persons; some Germans, some Irish, and 
twenty-five or thirty Gypsies. Forty or fifty of these were 
on their knees in their berths, engaged in prayer. No 
camp-meeting ever presented a more noisy spectacle than did 
this cabin. The ship was rolling, and the sea running 
mountains high, and many of these passengers had given up 
all hope of ever seeing land again. The Gypsies were foremost 
amongst those who were praying; indeed, they seemed to fancy 
themselves in a camp-meeting, for many of them shouted at 
the top of their voices. One of them, known as the “Queen of 
the Gypsies,” came to me and said, “O, Master! do get down 
and help us to ask God to stop the wind! You are a black man; 
may be he 'll pay more
<pb id="brown310" n="310"/>
attention to what you say. Now do, master, do! and when the 
storm is over I will tell your fortune for nothing.” At this 
juncture one of the chests which had been fastened to the 
floor broke away from its moorings, and came sliding across 
the cabin at the rate of about twenty miles per hour; soon 
another got loose, and these two locomotives broke up the 
prayer-meeting. Trunk after trunk became unfastened, until 
some eight or ten were crossing the cabin every time the 
vessel went over. At last the loose boxes upset the tables, 
on which were some of the passengers' eatables, and in a 
short time the whole cabin was in splendid confusion. The 
lamps, one after another, were knocked down and extinguished, 
so that the cabin was in total darkness. As I turned to 
retrace my steps, I heard the company joining in the prayer, 
and I was informed the next day that it was kept up during 
most of the night.</p>
        <p>With all the watchfulness on the day of sailing, several 
persons succeeded in stowing themselves away. First one came 
out, and then another, until not less than five made their 
appearance on deck. As fast as these men were discovered 
they were put to work; so that labor, if not money, might be 
obtained for their passage. On the sixth day out I missed a 
small leather trunk, and search was immediately made in 
every direction, but no tidings of it could be found. 
However, after its being lost two days, I offered a reward 
for its recovery, and it was soon found, hid away in the 
forecastle. It had been broken open, and a few things, 
together with a little money, had
<pb id="brown311" n="311"/>
been taken. The ships Chieftain and Harmony were the only 
vessels we met during the first ten days. An iceberg made 
its appearance while we were on the banks, but it was some 
distance to the larboard.</p>
        <p>After a long passage of twenty days we arrived at the mouth 
of the Delaware, and took a pilot on board. The passengers 
were now all life; the Irish were basking in the sun, the 
Germans were singing, and the Gypsies were dancing. Some 
fifteen miles below Philadelphia, the officers came on 
board, to see that no sickness was on the vessel; and, after 
being passed by the doctors, each person began to get his 
luggage on deck, and prepare to go on shore. About four 
o'clock, on the twenty-sixth day of September, 1854, the 
City of Manchester hauled alongside the Philadelphia wharf, 
and the passengers all on the move; the Scotch lass clinging 
to the arm of her new Highland laddie, and the young English 
lady in company with her “fresh” lover. It is a dangerous 
thing to allow the Atlantic Ocean to separate one from his 
or her “affectionate friend.” The City of Manchester, though 
not a fast steamer, is, nevertheless, a safe one. Her 
officers are men of experience and activity. Captain Wyly 
was always at his post; the first officer was an able 
seaman, and Mr. John Mirehouse, the second officer, was a 
most gentlemanly and obliging, as well as experienced 
officer. To this gentleman I am much indebted for kind 
attention shown me on the voyage. I had met him on a former 
occasion at Whitehaven. He is a stanch friend of humanity.</p>
        <pb id="brown312" n="312"/>
        <p>At Philadelphia I met with a most cordial reception at the 
hands of the Motts, J. M. M'Kim, the Stills, the Fortens, 
and that distinguished gentleman and friend of the slave, 
Robert Purvis, Esq. There is no colored man in this country 
to whom the Anti-slavery cause is more indebted than to Mr. 
Purvis. Endowed with a capacious and reflective mind, he is 
ever in search after truth; and, consequently, all reforms 
find in him an able and devoted advocate. Inheriting a large 
fortune, he has had the means, as well as the will, to do 
good. Few men in this country, either colored or white, 
possess the rare accomplishments of Robert Purvis. In no 
city in the Free States does the Anti-slavery movement have 
more bitter opponents than in Philadelphia. Close to two of 
our Southern States, and connected as it is in a commercial 
point of view, it could scarcely be otherwise. Colorphobia 
is more rampant there than in the pro-slavery, negro-hating 
city of New York. I was not destined to escape this 
unnatural and anti-christian prejudice. While walking 
through Chestnut-street, in company with two of my 
fellow-passengers, we hailed an omnibus going in the 
direction which we wished to go. It immediately stopped, 
and the white men were furnished with seats, but I was told 
that “We don't allow niggers to ride in here.” It so 
happened that these two persons had rode in the same car 
with me from London to Liverpool. We had put up at the same 
hotel at the latter place, and had crossed the Atlantic in 
the same steamer. But as soon as we touch the soil of 
America we can no
<pb id="brown313" n="313"/>
longer ride in the same conveyance, no longer eat at the 
same table, or be regarded with equal justice, by our 
thin-skinned democracy. During five years' residence in 
monarchical Europe I had enjoyed the rights allowed to all 
foreigners in the countries through which I passed; but on 
returning to my NATIVE LAND the influence of slavery meets 
me the first day that I am in the country. Had I been an 
escaped felon, like John Mitchell, no one would have 
questioned my right to a seat in a Philadelphia omnibus. 
Neither of the foreigners who were allowed to ride in this 
carriage had ever visited our country before. The 
constitution of these United States was as a blank to them: 
the Declaration of Independence, in all probability, they 
had never seen,—much less, read. But what mattered it? 
They were white, and that was enough. The fact of my being 
an American by birth could not be denied; that I had read 
and understood the constitution and laws, the most 
pro-slavery, negro-hating professor of Christianity would 
admit; but I was colored, and that was enough. I had partaken
of the hospitality of noblemen in England, had sat at
the table of the French Minister of Foreign Affairs;
I had looked from the strangers' gallery down upon the
great legislators of England, as they sat in the House of
Commons; I had stood in the House of Lords, when
Her Britannic Majesty prorogued her Parliament; I had
eaten at the same table with Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, 
Charles Dickens, Eliza Cook, Alfred Tennyson, and
the son-in-law of Sir Walter Scott; the omnibuses of
<pb id="brown314" n="314"/>
Paris, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool, had stopped to take 
me up; I had often entered the “Caledonia,” “Bayswater,” 
“Hammersmith,” “Chelsea,” “Bluebell,” and other omnibuses 
that rattle over the pavements, of Regent-street, Cheapside, 
and the west end of London,—but what mattered that? My 
face was not white, my hair was not straight; and, therefore, 
I must be excluded from a seat in a third-rate American 
omnibus. Slavery demanded that it should be so. I charge 
this prejudice to the pro-slavery pulpits of our land, which 
first set the example of proscription by erecting in their 
churches the “negro pew.” I charge it to that hypocritical 
profession of democracy which will welcome fugitives from 
other countries, and drive its own into exile. I charge it 
to the recreant sons of the men who carried on the American 
revolutionary war, and who come together every fourth of July 
to boast of what their fathers did, while they, their sons, 
have become associated with bloodhounds, to be put at any 
moment on the track of the fugitive slave.</p>
        <p>But I had returned to the country for the express purpose of 
joining in the glorious battle against slavery, of which 
this Negrophobia is a legitimate offspring. And why not meet 
it in its stronghold? I might have remained in a country 
where my manhood was never denied; I might have remained in 
ease in other climes; but what was ease and comfort abroad, 
while more than three millions of my countrymen were 
groaning in the prison-house of slavery in the Southern 
States? Yes, I
<pb id="brown315" n="315"/>
came to the land of my nativity, not to be a spectator, but 
a soldier—a soldier in this moral warfare against the 
most cruel system of oppression that ever blackened the 
character or hardened the heart of man. And the smiles of 
my old associates, and the approval of my course while 
abroad by my colored fellow-citizens, has amply compensated 
me for the twenty days rough passage on my return.</p>

        <head>OPINIONS OF THE BRITISH PRESS.</head>
        <p>“While all the world is reading ‘Uncle Tom's Cabin,’ it is 
quite possible that what a real fugitive slave has to say 
for himself may meet with less attention than it deserves. 
Mr. Brown's book is pleasingly written.”—<hi rend="italics">The Critic</hi>, 
Dec. 10, 1852.</p>
        <p>“When he writes on the wrongs of his race, or the events of 
his own career, he is always interesting or amusing.”—
<hi rend="italics">The Athenæum</hi>, Nov. 15, 1852.</p>
        <p>“The appearance of this book is too remarkable a literary 
event to pass without a notice. At the moment when attention 
in this country is directed to the state of the colored 
people in America, the book appears with additional 
advantage; if nothing else were attained by its publication, 
it is well to have another proof of the capability of the 
negro intellect. Altogether, Mr. Brown has written a 
pleasing and amusing volume. Contrasted with the caricature 
and bombast of his white countryman Mr. Willis' description 
of ‘People he has Met,’ a comparison suggested by the 
similarity of the title, it is both in intellect and in 
style a superior performance, and we are glad to bear this 
testimony to the literary merit of a work by a negro author.”
—<hi rend="italics">The Literary Gazette</hi>, Oct. 2, 1852.</p>
        <p>“That a man who was a slave for the first twenty years of 
his life, and who has never had a day's schooling, should 
produce such a book as this, cannot but astonish those who 
speak disparagingly of the African race.”—<hi rend="italics">The Weekly 
News and Chronicle</hi>, Sept. 6, 1852.</p>
        <p>“It is something new for a self-educated slave to publish 
such a work.
<pb id="brown318" n="318"/>
It is really wonderful how one who has had to surmount so 
many difficulties in his literary career should have been 
able to produce a volume of so sparkling a character. The 
author is personally known to many of our readers, and, 
therefore, we need not enlarge respecting his abilities or 
his merits. We recommend them to procure his book, and are 
induced to do so by the consideration that his main object 
in bringing out the work is to enable him to educate his 
family; an object at all times honorable and praiseworthy, 
but in one occupying the position of William Wells Brown 
eminently commendable, and in which every friend of 
humanity must wish him success.”—<hi rend="italics">British Friend</hi>, Aug. 1852.</p>
        <p>“This remarkable book of a remarkable man cannot fail to add 
to the practical protests already entered in Britain 
against the absolute bondage of three millions of our 
fellow-creatures. The impressions of a self-educated son of 
slavery, here set forth, must hasten the period when the 
senseless and impious denial of common claims to a common 
humanity, on the score of color, shall be scouted with scorn 
in every civilized and Christian country. And when this 
shall be attained, among the means of destruction of the 
hideous abomination his compatriots will remember with 
respect and gratitude the doings and sayings of William 
Wells Brown. The volume consists of a sufficient variety of 
scenes, persons, arguments, inferences, speculations and 
opinions, to satisfy and amuse the most <hi rend="italics">exigeant</hi> of those 
who read <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">pour se desennuyer;</hi></foreign> while those who look deeper 
into things, and view with anxious hope the progress of 
nations and of mankind, will feel that the good cause of 
humanity and freedom, of Christianity, enlightenment and 
brotherhood, cannot fail to be served by such a book as 
this.”—<hi rend="italics">Morning Advertiser</hi>, Sept. 10, 1852.</p>
        <p>“He writes with ease and ability, and his intelligent 
observations upon the great question to which he has devoted 
and is devoting his life will be read with interest, and 
will command influence and respect.”—<hi rend="italics">Daily News</hi>, Sept. 24, 1852.</p>
        <p>“The extraordinary excitement produced by ‘Uncle Tom's 
Cabin’ will, we hope, prepare the public of Great Britain 
and America for this lively book of travels by a real 
fugitive slave. Though he never had a day's schooling in his 
life, he has produced a literary work not unworthy of a 
highly-educated gentleman. Our readers will find in these 
letters much instruction, not a little entertainment, and 
the beatings of a
<pb id="brown319" n="319"/>
manly heart, on behalf of a down-trodden race, with which 
they will not fail to sympathize.”—<hi rend="italics">The Eclectic 
Review</hi>, Nov. 1852.</p>
        <p>“We have read this book with an unusual measure of interest. 
Seldom, indeed, have we met with anything more captivating. 
It somehow happens that all these fugitive slaves are 
persons of superior talents. The pith of the volume consists 
in narratives of voyages and journeys made by the author in 
England, Scotland, Ireland and France; and we can assure 
our readers that Mr. Brown has travelled to some purpose.
The number of white men is not great who could have made 
more of the many things that came before them. There is in 
the work a vast amount of quotable matter, which, but for 
want of space, we should be glad to extract. As the volume, 
however, is published with a view to promote the benefit of 
the interesting fugitive, we deem it better to give a 
general opinion, by which curiosity may be whetted, than to 
gratify it by large citation. A book more worth the money 
has not, for a considerable time, come into our hands.”—
<hi rend="italics">British Banner</hi>, Dec. 15, 1852.</p>
        <p>“THREE YEARS IN EUROPE—The remarkable man who is the 
author of this work is not unknown to many of our readers. 
He was received with kindness in this city, and honored with 
various marks of respect by many eminent characters in the 
sister country. Since his arrival Mr. Brown has contributed 
much to the press; and the work before us, though small and 
unpretending, is of a high character, and evinces a superior 
and cultivated mind.”—<hi rend="italics">Dublin General Advertiser</hi>, October
30, 1852.</p>
        <p>“This is a thrilling book, independent of adventitious 
circumstances, which will enhance its popularity. The author 
of it is not a man in America, but a chattel, a thing to be 
bought, and sold, and whipped: but in Europe he is an 
author, and a successful one, too. He gives in this book an 
interesting and graphic description of a three years' 
residence in Europe. The book will no doubt obtain, as it 
well deserves, a rapid and wide popularity.”—<hi rend="italics">Glasgow 
Examiner.</hi></p>
        <p>“The above is the title of an intelligent and otherwise 
well-written book, in which the author details, in a 
pleasing and highly-interesting manner, an account of places 
he has seen and people he has met; and we take much pleasure 
in recommending it to our readers.”—<hi rend="italics">Weekly Dispatch.</hi></p>
        <pb id="brown320" n="320"/>
        <p>“This is an interesting volume, ably written, hearing on 
every page the impress of honest purpose and noble 
aspiration. One is amused by the well-told anecdotes, and 
charmed with the painter-like descriptions of towns, cities 
and natural scenery. Indeed, our author gives many very 
recognizable sketches of the places he has seen and people 
he has met. His three years in Europe have been well spent. 
The work will be appreciated by all the friends of the 
negro.”—<hi rend="italics">The Leader.</hi></p>
        <p>“W. Wells Brown is no ordinary man, or he could not have so 
remarkably surmounted the many difficulties and impediments 
of his training as a slave. By dint of resolution, 
self-culture and force of character, he has rendered himself 
a popular lecturer to a British audience, and vigorous 
expositor of the evils and atrocities of that system whose 
chains he has shaken off so triumphantly and forever. We may 
safely pronounce William Wells Brown a remarkable man, and a 
full refutation of the doctrine of the inferiority of the 
negro.”—<hi rend="italics">Glasgow Citizen.</hi></p>
        <p>“We can assure those who are inclined to take up this volume 
that they will find it written with commendable care, as 
well as fluency, and will derive much pleasure from a 
perusal of it.”—<hi rend="italics">Bristol Mercury.</hi></p>
        <p>“The profound Anti-slavery feeling produced by ‘Uncle Tom's 
Cabin’ needed only such a book as this, which shows so 
forcibly the powers and capacity of the negro intellect, to 
deepen the impression. The work certainly exhibits a most 
favorable contrast to the more ambitious productions of many 
of his white countrymen, N. P. Willis among others.”—
<hi rend="italics">Caledonian Mercury.</hi></p>
