        <head>PREFACE</head>
        <p>THE life which is described in the following pages has both a
permanent interest and a permanent value. But the efforts
which are now made to effect the abolition of slavery in the
United Sates of America, seem to render the present moment
specially fit for the appearance of a memoir of TOUSSAINT
L'OUVERTURE. A hope of affording some aid to the sacred cause
of freedom, specially as involved in the extinction of slavery,
and in the removal of prejudices on which servitude mainly
depends, has induced the author to prepare the present work for 
the press. If apology for such a publication were required, it
might be found in the fact that no detailed life of TOUISSAINT
L'OVERTURE is accessible to the English reader, for the only
memoir of him which exists in our language has long been out
of print.</p>
        <p>The sources of information on this subject are found chiefly in
the French language. To several of these the author acknowledges
deep obligation.</p>
        <p>The tone taken on the subject of negro freedom in Hayti, by
<pb id="beardvi" n="vi"/>
recent writers in two French reviews, is partial and unjust.
Possibly this may be attributable to a mulatto pen. The blacks
have no authors; their cause, consequently, has not yet been
pleaded. In the authorities we possess on the subject, either
French or mulatto interests, for the most part, predominate.
Specially predominant are mulatto interests and prejudices, in
the recently published <hi rend="italics">Life of Toussaint L'Ouverture,</hi> by SAINT
REMY, a mulatto: this writer obviously values his caste more
than his country or his kind.</p>

              <p>Description of Hayti—its name, mountains, rivers climate, productions, and 
chief cities and towns.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I AM about to sketch the history and character of one of those
extraordinary men, whom Providence, from time to time, raises
up for the accomplishment of great, benign, and far-reaching
results. I am about to supply the clearest evidence that there is no
insuperable barrier between the light and the dark-coloured tribes
of our common human species. I am about to exhibit, in a series of
indisputable facts, a proof that the much misunderstood and
downtrodden negro race are capable of the loftiest virtues, and the 
most heroic efforts. I am about to present a tacit parallel between 
white men and dark men, in which the latter will appear to no
disadvantage. Neither eulogy, however, nor disparagement is
my aim, but the simple love of justice. It is a history—not an
argument—that I purpose to set forth. In prosecuting the narrative,
I shall have to conduct the reader through scenes of aggression, 
resistance, outrage, revenge, bloodshed, and cruelty, that
grieve and wound the hear, and exciting the deepest pity for
<pb id="beard2" n="2"/>
the sufferers, raise irrepressible indignation against ambition,
injustice and tyranny—the scourges of the world, and specially
the sources of complicated and horrible calamities to the natives 
of Africa.</p>
            <p>The western portion of the North Atlantic Ocean is separated
from the Caribbean Sea on the south, and the Gulf of Mexico
on the north, by a succession of islands which, under the name
of the West India Isles, seem to unite in a broken and waving
line, the two great peninsulas of South and North America. Of
these islands, which, under the general title of the Antilles, are
divided into several groups, the largest and the most important
are, Porto Rico on the east, Cuba on the west, and St. Domingo
between the two, with Jamaica laying on the western extremity
of the latter. Situated between the seventeenth and twentieth
degree of north latitude, Saint Domingo stretches from east to west
about 390 miles, with and average breadth, form north to south, of
100 miles, and comprises about 29,000 square miles, or 18,816,000
square acres;—being four times as large as Jamaica, and nearly
equal in extent to Ireland. Its original name, and that by which it
is now generally known, Hayti—which, in the Caribbean tongue,
signifies <hi rend="italics">a land of mountains</hi>—is truly descriptive of its surface 
and general appearance. From a ventral point, which near the
middle of the island rises to the height of some 6,000 feet above
the level of the sea, branches, having parallel ranges on the north
and on the south, run through the whole length of the island,—
giving it somewhat the shape and aspect of a huge tortoise. The
mountain ridges for the most part extend to the sea, above
which they stand in lofty precipices, forming numerous headlands
and promontories; or, retiring before the ocean, give place
to ample and commodious bays. Of these bays and harbours, three
deserve mention; not only for their extraordinary natural capabilities,
but for the frequency with which two of them, at least,
will appear in these pages. On the north-west of Hayti, is the
Bay of Samana, with its deep recesses and curving shores, 
terminating in Cape Samana on the north, and Cape Raphail on
the south. At the opposite end of the country, is the magnificent
<pb id="beard3" n="3"/>
harbour called the Bay Port au Prince, enclosing the long
and rocky isle Gonave—on the north of which is the channel St.
Marc, and on the south the channel Gonave. Important as is
the part which this harbour sustains in the history of the land,
scarcely, if at all less important, is the bay which has Cape
François for its western point, and Grange for its eastern,
comprising on the latter side the minor, but well-sheltered Bay of
Mancenille; and in the former, the large roadstead of Cape
François.</p>
            <p>The mountains running east and west break asunder, and sink
down, so as to form three spacious valleys, which are watered by the
three principal rivers. The River Youna, having its sources in 
Mount La Vega, in the north-east of the island, and receiving
many tributaries from the north and the south, issues in the Bay
of Samana. The Grand Yaque, rising on the western side of the
Watershed—of which La Vega may be considered as the dividing
line,—flows through the lengthened plain of St. Jago, until it
reaches the sea in the Bay of Mancenille. The chief river is the 
Artibonite, on the west, which, having its ultimate springs in the
central group of mountains, waters the valleys of St. Thomas, of
Banica, of Goave; and turning suddenly to the north, along the
western side of the mountains of Cahos, falls into the ocean a
little south of the Bay of Gonaives, after a long and winding 
course. While these rivers run from east to west and west to
east, innumerable streams flow in a northern and southern direction,
proceeding at right angles from the branches of the great
trunk. Hayti is a well-watered land; especially is it so in
the west, where several lakes and tarns adorn and enrich the
country. The more eastern districts are rugged as well as lofty,
but the other parts are beautifully diversified with romantic
glens, prolific vales, and rank savannahs. Though so mountainous,
the surface is overspread with vegetation, the highest 
summits being crowned with forests. Placed with the tropics,
Hayti has a hot yet humid climate, with a temperature of very
great variations—so that while in the deep valleys the sun
is almost intolerable, on the loftiest mountains of the interior, a
<pb id="beard4" n="4"/>
fire is often necessary to comfort. The ardour of the sun is on the coast
moderated by the sea and land breezes, which blow in succession.
Heavy rains fall in the months of May and June. Hurricanes are less
frequent in Hayti than the rest of the Antilles. The climate, however, is 
liable to great and sudden changes, which bringing storm, tempest, and sunshine, with the intensity of tropical lands, now alarm and now enervate 
the natives, and often prove very injurious to Europeans. On so rich a soil human life is easily supported, and the inducements to the labours of industry are neither numerous nor strong. Yet, in auspicious periods of its history, Hayti has been made abundantly productive.</p>
            <p>At the time when the hero and patriot whose career we have
to describe first appeared on the scene, the island was divided between
two European powers; the east was possessed by the Spaniards, the west 
and south by the French. It is with the latter portion that this history is mostly concerned. Of the Spanish possessions, therefore, it may suffice to direct attention to two principal cities. The oldest European city is Santo Domingo, which had the honour of giving a name to the whole island. It was founded by
Bartholomew, the brother of Columbus, who is said to have so called it
in honour of his father, who bore that name. Santo Domingo stands in
the south-eastern part of the island, at the north of the River Ozama.
Santiago holds a fine position in the plain of that name, near the northern end of a line passing somewhere about the middle of the island. The French
colony was divided into three provinces—that of the north, that of the
west, and that of the south. At the beginning of the French Revolution of 1789, these provinces were transformed into three corresponding departments. The three provinces, or departments, were subdivided into twelve districts, each bearing the name of its chief city. The twelve districts were—in the north, the Cape, or Cap François, Fort Dauphin, Port-de-Paix, 
Môle Saint Nicholas; in the west, Port-au-Prince, Leogane, Saint Marc,
Petit Goave; and in the south, Jérémie, Cape Tiburon, Cayes and St.,
Louis. The district of the Cape
<pb id="beard5" n="5"/>
comprised the Cape, La Plaine-du-Nord, just above the Cape,
Limonade, between the two; Acul, west of the Cape, and on the
coast, Sainte Suzanne; with Morin, La Grande Rivière, Dondon,
Marmelade, Limbé, Port Margot, Plaisance, and Borgne—thirteen
parishes. The district Fort Dauphin, in the east of the northern
department, comprised Fort Dauphin itself, Ouanaminthe, on the
South of it, Vallière, Terrier Rouge, and Trou—five parishes.
The district of the Port-de-Paix comprised, Port-de-Paix, 
Petit-Saint-Louis, Jean Rabel, and Gros Morne—four parishes. 
The district of the Mole Saint Nicholas comprised Saint Nicholas
and Bombarde, two parishes. There were thus four-and-twenty
parishes in the northern department. The district Port-au-Prince 
comprised, Port-au-Prince, Croix-des-Bosquets, on the north, 
Arcahaye on the north-west, and Mirebalais on the north-east
—four parishes. The district of Léogane was identical with
the parish of the same name. The district of Saint Marc comprised,
Saint Marc, Petite Rivière, Gonaives—three parishes.
The district of Petit-Goave comprised Petit Goave, Grand Goave,
Baynet, Jacmel, and Cayes-Jacmel—five parishes. Fourteen
parishes made up the western province. The district Jérémie
comprised Jérémie and Cap Dame-Marie—two parishes. The
district of Tiburon comprised Cape Tiburon and Coteaux—two
parishes. The district of Cayes comprised Cayes and Torbeck
—two parishes. The district of Saint Louis comprised, Saint Louis,
Anse-Veau, Fond-Cavaillon and Acquin—five parishes. There
were eleven parishes in the south.</p>

            <p>The study of the map will show that these, the districts under the
dominion of France, covered only the west of the island. As, however,
they contained the chief centres of civilization, and the
<pb id="beard6" n="6"/>
chief places which occur in this history, our end is answered by the
geographical details now given.</p>
            <p>The appearance of the island from the ocean is thus described by an
eye-witness:—“The bold outlines of the mountains, which in many places
approached to within twenty miles of the shore, and the numerous
stupendous cliffs which beetled over it, casting
their shadows to a great distance in the deep,—the dark retreating
bays, particularly that of Samana, and extensive plains
opening inland between the lofty cloud-covered hills, or running
for uncounted leagues by the sea side, covered with trees and
bushes, but affording no glimpse of a human habitation,—presented
a picture of gloom and grandeur, calculated deeply to
impress the mind; such a picture as dense solitude, unenlivened
by a single trace of civilization, is ever apt to produce. Where,
we inquire of ourselves, are the people of this country? Where
its cultivation? Are the ancient Indian possessors of the soil all
extinct, and their cruel conquerors and successors entombed with
them in a common grave? For hundreds of miles, as we swept
along its shores, we saw no living thing, but now and then a
mariner in a solitary skiff, or birds of the land and ocean sailing
in the air, as if to show us that nature had not wholly lost its
animation, and sunk into the sleep of death.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref1" n="1" rend="sc" target="note1">*</ref></p>
            <note id="note1" n="1" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref1">*“Brief Notes on Hayti,” by John Candler. London, 1842.</note>
            <p>The interior of Hayti, however, lacks neither inhabitants nor
natural beauty. The mountains rise in bold and varying outline
against the brilliant skies, and in almost every part form a 
background of great and impressive effect. Broken by deep ravines,
and appearing in bare and rugged precipices, they present a 
continued variety of imposing objects which sometimes rise into the
sublime. The valleys and plains are rich at once in verdure and
beauty, while from elevated spots you may enjoy the sight of
the great centres of civilization, Cap-Français, Port-de-Paix,
Saint-Marc, Port-au-Prince, &amp;c., busy in the various pursuits of
city and commercial life. Alas! that scenes so attractive should,
at the time our narrative commences, have been disturbed and
<pb id="beard7" n="7"/>
made repulsive by the forced labour of myriads of human beings
occupied on the numerous plantations, which , but for greed, and
oppression, and cruelty, would themselves have multiplied the
natural charms of the island.</p>
            <p>The wealth of Hayti comes from its soil. It is an essentially
agricultural country. Cereal products are not cultivated; but
maize or Indian corn grows there; and rice flourishes in the
savannahs. The negro lives on manioc chiefly, and obtains other
breadstuffs from the United States and from Canada. There
are, however, other substances which supply him with food when
corn fails—such as bananas, yams, and potatoes. Plantation
tillage is the chief occupation. This culture embraces sugar,
coffee, cotton, indigo, and cotton. In 1789, the French portion
of the island contained 793 sugar plantations, 3,117 coffee 
plantations, 789 cotton plantations, and 182 establishments for
making rum, besides other minor factories and workshops. In
1791, very large capitals were employed in carrying on these
cultivations; the capitals were sunk partly in slaves and partly
in implements of husbandry; in the cultivation of sugar there
was employed a capital of above fifty millions of livres;<ref targOrder="U" id="ref2" n="2" rend="sc" target="note2">*</ref>
<note id="note2" n="2" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref2">*A livre, or franc, is worth about ten pence of our money.</note> forty-six
millions in coffee, and twenty-one millions in cotton; and
in 1776, there was employed a capital of sixty-three millions in
the cultivation of indigo. The total value of the plantations
was immense, as may be learnt from the fact, that the value of
the products of the French portion was estimated,
<list type="simple"><item>In 1767 at 75,000,000 francs.</item><item>" 1774 " 82,000,000 "</item><item>" 1776 " 95,148,500"</item><item>" 1789 " 175,990,00 "</item></list></p>
            <p>The last value is the highest. The sum represents the supreme
pressure of servitude, and is consequently a measure of the injury
done to the black dwellers in Saint Domingo. Already, in 1801,
the value fell to 65,352,039—in other words, the slave-masters
<pb id="beard8" n="8"/>
were, at the end of two years, punished for their injustice and
tyranny by the immediate loss of nearly two-thirds of their
property; so uncertain is the tenure of ill-gotten gain. Among the
territorial riches of Hayti, its beasts of burden and oxen must
take a high position. In 1789, the soil supported 57,782
horses; 48,823 mules, and 247,612 horned cattle.</p>
            <p>Hayti possesses an abundant source of opulence in its numerous
forests, which produce various kinds of precious wood
employed in making and decorating furniture and articles of taste.</p>
            <p>In 1791, goods exported from Hayti to France
to the value of 133, 534, 423 francs—that is, above five millions
sterling. The entire value of the territorial riches of the chief 
plantations, including slaves, amounted to no less a sum than
991,893,334 francs. Curious is it in the statistical table issued
by authority, whence we learn these particulars, to see “negroes
and animals employed in husbandry” put into the same class.
Observe, too, the items. The value of the “negroes old and new,
large and small” is set down at 758,333,334 francs, while the 
other<hi rend="italics"> animals</hi> are worth 5, 226,667 francs. We thus learn,
that three-fourths of the wealth of the planters consisted in their
slaves. Such was the stake which was at issue in the struggle
for freedom of which we are about to speak.</p>
            <p>The population of Hayti was, in the year 1824, accounted to
amount to 935,335 individuals. This is not a large number for
so fertile a land. But it has been questioned whether more than
700,000 dwelt on the soil. Doubtless, the wars which have
successively agitated the country for more than half a century, have
greatly thinned the population. There has, however, been a constant
immigration to Hayti from neighbouring islands, and
even from the continent of America. Of the total number of
inhabitants just given, there were, in 1824,
<list type="simple"><item>In the Kingdom of Henry I. (Christophe) . . . . . 367,721</item><item>In the Republic, under Pétion . . . . . 506,146</item><item>In the old Spanish District . . . . . 61, 468</item><item>935,335</item></list></p>
            <pb id="beard9" n="9"/>
            <p>This mass, viewed in regard to origin, was divided thus:—
<list type="simple"><item>Negroes . . . . . 819,000</item><item>Men of mixed blood . . . . . 105,000</item><item>Red Indians . . . . . 1,500</item><item>Whites . . . . . 500</item><item>Foreigners . . . . .10,000</item><item>936,000</item></list></p>
            <p>The small number of whites was occasioned by the strict
enforcement of the law which declared “No white of any nation
whatever shall set his foot on this territory, in the quality of a 
master or proprietor.”</p>
            <p>The language prevalent in the west and north is the French;
that generally used in the East is the Spanish. Neither is spoken
in purity. Not only has the French the ordinary grammatical
faults which belong to the uneducated, but out of the peculiar
relations in which they have stood in social and political life, as well as
the nature of the climate and the products of the soil, a
Haytian <hi rend="italics">patois</hi> has been formed which can scarcely be understood
by Frenchmen exclusively accustomed to their pure
mother tongue. And while the educated classes speak and write 
what in courtesy may be called classic French, the few
authors whom the island has produced do not appear capable of
imitating, if they are capable of appreciating, the purity, ease,
point, and flow which characterize the best French prose
writers.</p>
            <p>The religion of Hayti is the Roman Catholic. This form of
religion is established by law. Under former governments
other systems were tolerated. At present the spirit of 
exclusiveness predominates. The religion of Rome exists
among the people in a corrupt state, nor are the highest
functionaries free from a gross superstition, which takes 
much of its force from old African traditions and observances, 
as well as from the peculiar susceptibilities of the negro temperament.
As soon as the native chiefs began to obtain political
power in their struggle for freedom 
<pb id="beard10" n="10"/>
they practically recognised the importance of general education,
well knowing that only by raising the slaves into men could they
accomplish their task and perpetuate their power. Accordingly
educational institutions have, from time to time, been set up in different
parts of the island. These establishments have received favour and
encouragement according to the spirit of the government of the day. At
present they receive a support less liberal than that which is bestowed
on the army.</p>
            <p>The ensuing narrative will show the various forms of government
which have established themselves in Hayti since the yoke of the
planters and of France was broken. With a tendency to exaggeration,
which is a marked feature in the negro character, the present ruler, not
content with the title of president or with even that of king, enjoys the
high-sounding dignity of emperor.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
            <argument>
              <p>Columbus discovers Hayti—under his successors, the Spanish colony extirpate the natives—The Buccaneers lay in the west the basis of the French colony—its growth and prosperity.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WE owe the discovery of Hayti to Columbus. When on his first voyage
he had left the Leucayan islands, he, on the fifth of December, 1492,
came in sight of Hayti, which at first he regarded as the Continent.
Having, under the shelter of a bay, cast anchor at the western extremity
of the island, and named the spot Saint Nicholas, in honour of the saint
of the day, he sent men to explore the country. These, on their return,
made to Columbus a report, which was the more attractive, because
they had found in the new country resemblances to their native land. A
similar impression having been made on Columbus,
<pb id="beard11" n="11"/>
especially by the songs which he heard in the air, and by fishes which
had been caught on the coast, he named the island Espagnola,
(Hispaniola,) or <hi rend="italics">Little Spain.</hi> Forthwith on his arrival, Columbus began
to inquire for gold; the answers which he received, induced him to
direct his course towards the south. On his way, he entered a port
which he called Valparaiso, now Port-de-Paix; and in this and a second
visit occupied and named other spots, taking possession of the country
on behalf of his patrons Ferdinand and Isabella, sovereigns of Spain.
The return of Columbus to Europe, after his first voyage, was
accompanied by triumphs and marvels which directed the attention of
the civilised world to the newly-discovered countries; and, exciting
ambition and cupidity, originated the movement which precipitated
Europeans on the American shores, and not only occasioned there
oppression and cruelty, but introduced with African blood worse than
African slavery, big with evils the most multiform and the most terrible.</p>
            <p>At the time of its discovery, Hayti was occupied by—if we may trust
the reports—a million of inhabitants, of the Caribbean race: they were
dark in colour, short and small in person, and simple in their modes of
life. Amid the abundance of nature, they easily gained a subsistence,
and passed their many leisure hours either in unthinking repose, or in
dances, enlivened by drums and varied with songs. Polygamy was not
only practised but sanctioned. A petty sovereign is said to have had a
harem of two-and-thirty wives. Standing but a few degrees above
barbarism, the natives were under the dominion of five petty kings or
chiefs, called Caciques, who possessed absolute power; and were
subject to the yet more rigorous sway of priests or Butios, to whom
superstition lent an influence which was the greater because it included
the resources of the physician as well as those of the enchanter. Under
a repulsive exterior, the Haytians, however, acknowledged a supreme
power—the Author of all things, and entertained a dim idea of a future
life, involving rewards and punishments correspondent to their low
moral condition and gross conceptions.</p>
            <pb id="beard12" n="12"/>
            <p>On the arrival of Columbus, the natives, alarmed, withdrew into their
dense forests. Gradually won back, they became familiarized with the
new-comers, of whose ulterior designs they were utterly ignorant. With
their assistance, Columbus erected, near Cap François, a small fortress
which he designated Navidad, (nativity,) from the day of the nativity,
(December 25th,) on which it was completed. In this, the first edifice
built by Europeans on the Western Hemisphere, he placed a garrison of
eight-and-thirty men. When (on the 27th of October, 1493) he returned,
he found the settlement in ruins, and learned that his men, impelled by
the thirst for gold, had made their way to the mountains of Cibao,
reported to contain mineral treasures. He erected another stronghold on
the east of Cape Monte Christo. There, under the name of Isabella,
arose the first city founded by the Spaniards, who thence went forth in
quest of the much coveted precious ore. Meanwhile the new colony
had serious difficulties to struggle with. Barely were they saved from the 
devastations of a famine. Their acts of injustice drove the natives
into open assault, which it required the skill and bravery of Columbus to
overcome. His recall to Europe set all things in confusion. Restrained in
some degree by his moderation and humanity, the natives on his
departure rose against his brother and representative, Bartholomew;
and receiving support from another of his officers, namely, Rolando
Ximenes, they aspired to recover the dominion of the island. They
failed in their undertaking, the rather that Bartholomew knew how to
gain for himself the advantage of a judicious and benevolent course.
The love of a young Spaniard, named Diaz, for the daughter of a native
chief, led Bartholomew to the mouth of the river Ozama. Finding the
locality very superior, he built a citadel and founded a city there, which,
under the name of Santo Domingo, he made his head quarters,
intending it to be the capital of the country. Meanwhile Ximenes, at Fort
Isabella, carried on his opposition to the Government. Columbus's
return to the island in 1498 did not bring back the traitor to his duty.
Meanwhile, in Spain a storm had broken forth against Columbus, which
occasioned
<pb id="beard13" n="13"/>
his recall in 1499. The discoverer of the new world was put in chains
and thrown into prison by his successor, Bovadillo. With the departure
of Columbus, the spirit of the Spanish rule underwent a total change.
The natives, whom he and his brother had treated as subjects, were by
Bovadillo treated as slaves. Thousands of their best men were sent to
extract gold from the mines, and when they rapidly perished in labours
too severe for them, the loss was constantly made up by new supplies.
In 1501, Bovadillo was recalled. His successor, Ovando, was equally
unmerciful. On the death of Queen Isabella, and Columbus, the
Haytians lost the only persons who cared to mitigate their lot. Then all
consideration towards them disappeared. They were employed in the
most exhausting toil, they were misused in every manner; torn from the
bosom of their families, they were driven into the remotest parts of the
island, unprovided with even the bare necessaries of life. In 1506, a
royal decree consigned the remainder as slaves to the adventurers, and
Ovando failed not to carry the unchristian and inhuman ordinance into
full effect, especially in regard to those who were at work in the mines,
four of which were very productive. A rising which took place in 1502,
had no other result than to rivet the chains under which the natives
groaned and perished. Another in 1503, brought Anacoana, a native
queen, to the scaffold. In 1507, the number of the Haytians had by toil,
hunger, and the sword, been reduced from a million down to sixty
thousand persons. Of little service was it that about this time, Pedro
d'Atenza introduced the sugar-cane from the Canaries, or that Gonzalez,
having set up the first sugar-mill, gave an impulse to agriculture; there
were no hands to carry  on the work, for the master laboured not, and
the slave, was beneath the sod. Ovando made an effort to procure
labourers from the Leucayan isles. Forty thousand of these victims
were transported to Hayti; they also sank under the labour. In 1511,
there were only fourteen thousand red men left on the island; and they
disappeared more and more in spite of the exertions for their
preservation made by the noble Las Casas. In 1519, a young
<pb id="beard14" n="14"/>
Cacique put himself at the head of the few remaining Haytians, and
after a bloody war of thirteen years' duration, extorted for himself and
followers a small territory on the north-east of Saint Domingo, where
their descendants are said to remain to the present day.</p>
            <p>Greatly did the island suffer by the loss of its native population; the
working of the gold mines ceased, or was carried on to a small extent,
and with inconsiderable results; agriculture proceeded only here and
there, and with tardy steps; the colony declined constantly more and
more on every side. The metropolis alone withstood the prevalent
causes of decay, for it had become a commercial entrepôt between
the old world and the new. Its prosperity, however, was, in 1586,
seriously shaken by the English commander, Francis Blake, who,
having seized the city, did not quit it until he had laid one half in ruins.
A still greater calamity impended. The reputed riches of the new world, 
and the wide spaces of open sea which its discovery made
known, invited thither maritime adventurers from the coasts of Europe.
Men of degraded character and boundless daring, finding it difficult to
procure a subsistence by piracy and contraband trade in their old
eastern haunts, now, from the newly-awakened spirit of maritime
enterprise, frequented, if not scoured by the vessels of England,
Holland and France, hurried away with fresh hopes into the western
ocean, and swarmed wherever plunder seemed likely to reward their
reckless hardihood.</p>
            <p>Of these, known in history as the buccaneers, a party took
possession (1630) of the isle of Tortuga, which lies off the northwest of
Hayti. With this, as a centre of operation, they carried on ceaseless
depredations against Hayti, the coasts of which they disturbed and
plundered, putting an end to its trade and occupying its capital. The
court of Madrid, being roused in self-defence, sent a fleet to Tortuga,
who, taking possession of the island, destroyed whatever of the
buccaneers they could find; but the success only made the pirates
more wary and more enterprising. When the fleet had quitted Tortuga,
<pb id="beard15" n="15"/>
they again, in 1638, made themselves masters there, and after
fortifying the island and establishing a sort of constitution,
made it a centre of piratical resources and aggressions, whence
they at their pleasure sallied forth to plunder and destroy ships
of all nations, wreaking their vengeance chiefly on such as came
from Spain. In time, however, these corsairs met with due
punishment at the hands of civilised nations. </p>
            <p>A remnant of the buccaneers, of French extraction, effected a
settlement on the south-western shores of Hayti, the possession of
which they successfully maintained against Spain, the then recognised
mistress of the island. In their new possessions they applied to the
tillage of the land; but becoming aware of the difficulty of maintaining
their hold without assistance, they applied to France. Their claim was
heard. In 1661, Dageron was sent to Hayti, with authority to take its
government into his hands, and accordingly effected there, in 1665, a
regularly constituted settlement. At this time the Spanish colony, which
was scattered over the east of the island, consisted only of fourteen
thousand free men, white and black, with the same number of slaves:
two thousand maroons, moreover, prowled about the interior, and were
in constant hostility with the colonists.</p>
            <p>As yet, the French colony in the west was very weak. Its chief centre
was in Tortuga, It had other settlements at Port de Paix, Port Margot,
and Léogane. When Dageron came to Hayti with the title of governor,
the Spaniards became more attentive to what went on in the west of
the island. They proceeded to attack the French settlements, but with
results so unsatisfactory, that the new French governor, Pouancey,
drove them from all their positions in the west. His successor, Cussy,
who took the helm in 1685, was less successful. The Spaniards made
head against him, and the French power was nearly annihilated. In
1691, France made another effort. The new governor, Ducasse,
restored her dominion, and in the peace of Ryswick, Spain found itself
obliged to cede to France the western half of Hayti. With
characteristic enterprise and
<pb id="beard16" n="16"/>
application, the French soon caused their colony to surpass the
Spanish portion in the elements of social well-being; and in the
long peace which followed the wars of the Spanish succession,
Saint-Domingue, (so the French called their part of the island,)
became the most important colony which France possessed in
the West Indies. It suffered, indeed, from Law's swindling
operations, and from other causes, but on the whole it made
great and rapid progress until the outbreak of the first 
revolutionary troubles in the mother country.</p>
            <p>Side by side with the advance of agriculture, opulence spread on
all sides, and poured untold treasures into France, In a similar proportion
the population expanded, so that in 1790, there were in the western half
of the island 555,825 inhabitants, of whom only 27,717 were white men,
and 21,800 free men of colour, while the slaves amounted to 495,528.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>The large black population of Hayti was of African origin.
Having been stolen from their native land, they were transplanted 
in the island to become beasts of burden to their masters. The infamous 
slave-trade was then at its height. Nations and individuals who stood at the
head of the civilised world, and prided themselves in the name of
Christian, were not ashamed to traffic in the bodies and the souls of
their fellow-men. Three hundred vessels, employed every year in that
detestable traffic, spread robbery, conflagration, and carnage over the
coasts and the lands of Africa. Eighty thousand men, women and
children, torn from their homes, were loaded with chains, and thrown
into the holds of the ships, a prey to desolation  
<figure id="ill2" entity="beard17"><p>SLAVE TRADE ON THE COAST OF AFRICA.</p></figure><pb id="beard17" n="17"/>
and despair. In vain had the laws and usages of Africa, less unjust
and cruel than those of Christian countries, forbidden the sale of men
born in slavery, permitting the outrage only in the case of persons taken
in war, or such as had lost their liberty by debt or crime. Cupidity created
an ever-growing demand; the price of human flesh rose in the market;
the required supply followed. The African princes, smitten with the love
of lucre, disregarded the established limitations, and for their own bad
purposes multiplied the causes which entailed the loss of liberty.
Proceeding from a less to a greater wrong, they undertook wars
expressly for the purpose of gaining captives for the slave mart, and 
when still the demand went on increasing, they became wholesale robbers
of men, and seized a village, or scoured a district. From the coasts the
devastation spread into the interior. A regularly organised system came
into operation, which constantly sent to the sea-shore thousands of
innocent and unfortunate creatures to whom death would have been a
happy lot. In the year 1778, not fewer than one hundred thousand of its
black inhabitants were forcibly and cruelly carried away from Africa.</p>
            <p>Driven on board the ships which waited their arrival, these poor
wretches, who had been accustomed to live in freedom and roam at
large, were thrust into a space scarcely large enough to receive their
coffin. If a storm arose the ports were closed as a measure of safety.
The precaution shut out light and air. Then who can say what torments
the negroes underwent? Thousands perished by suffocation—happily,
even at the cost of life, delivered from their frightful agonies. Death,
however, brought loss to their masters, and therefore it was warded
off when possible by inflections which, in stimulating the frame, kept
the vital energy in action. And when it was found that grief and
degradation proved almost as deadly as bad air and no air at all, the
victims were forced to dance and were insulted with music. If on the
ceasing of the tempest and the temporary disappearance of the plague,
things resumed their ordinary course, lust and brutality outraged
mothers and daughters unscrupulously, preferring as victims the young
and the innocent. When
<pb id="beard18" n="18"/>
any were overcome by incurable disease, they were thrown into the
ocean while yet alive, as worthless and unassailable articles. In
shipwreck, the living cargo of human beings were ruthlessly
abandoned. Fifteen thousand, it has been calculated,— fifteen thousand
corpses every year scattered in the ocean, the greater part of which
were thrown on the shores of the two hemispheres, marked the bloody
and deadly track of the hateful slave-trade.</p>
            <p>Hayti every year opened its markets to twenty thousand slaves. A
degradation awaited them on the threshold of servitude. With a
burning iron they stamped on the breast of each slave, women as well
as men, the name of their master, and that of the plantation where they
were to toil. There the newcomer found everything strange,—the skies,
the country, the language, the labour, the mode of life, the visage of his
master,—all was strange. Taking their place among their companions in
misfortune, they heard speak only of what they endured, and saw the
marks of the punishments they had received. Among ‘the old hands,’
few had reached advanced years; and of the new ones, many died of
grief. The high spirit of the men was bowed down. For the two first
years the women were not seldom struck with sterility. In earlier times
the proprietors had not wanted humanity, but riches had corrupted their
hearts now; and giving themselves up to ease and voluptuousness, they
thought of their slaves only as sources of income whence the utmost
was to be drawn. It is not meant that the slaves of the French Haytian
planters were worse treated than other slaves. Their condition, on the
whole, was slightly better. But the inherent evils of slavery are very
baneful and very numerous. Those evils prevailed in Hayti. The slave is
helpless, ignorant, morally low, and almost morally dead—reduced as
nearly as may be to a tool, a mere labouring machine, yet endued with
strong emotions and burning passions. The master is all-powerful, 
self-willed, capricious, greedy of gain, and given to pleasure. In such a
social condition vice and misery must abound; wherever such a social
condition has existed, vice and misery have abounded.</p>
            <pb id="beard19" n="19"/>
            <p>The evils consequent on slavery are not lessened by the 
incoming of one or two stray rays of light. If the slave becomes
conscious of his condition, and aware of the injustice under which he
suffers, if he obtains but a faint idea of these things; and if the master
learns that a desire for liberty has arisen in the slave's mind, or that
free men are asserting anti-slavery doctrines, then a new element of
evil is added to those which before were only too powerful. Hope on
one side, and distrust and fear on the other, create uneasiness and
disturbance, which may end in commotion, convulsion, cruelty, and
blood. In the agitation of the public mind of the world, which preceded
the first French Revolution, such feelings could not be excluded from
any community on earth; they entered the plantations of Hayti, and
they aided in preparing the terrific struggle, which, through alarm,
agitation, and slaughter, issued in the independence of the island.</p>
            <p>The white population was made up of diverse, and in a
measure conflicting elements. There were first the colonists or
planters. Of these, some lived in the colony, others lived in
France; the former, either by themselves or by means of
stewards, superintended the plantations, and consumed the produce 
in sensual gratifications; the latter, deriving immense
revenues directly or indirectly from their colonial estates, 
squandered their princely fortunes in the pleasures and vices of the
less moral society of Paris. Possessed of opulence, these men
generally were agitated with ambition, and sought office and
titles as the only good things on earth left them to pursue. If
debarred from entering the ranks of the French nobility, they
could aspire to official distinction in Hayti, and in reality held the
government of the colony very much in their own hands, partly in
virtue of their property, partly in virtue of their influence with the
French court.</p>
            <p>There were other men of European origin in the island. Some were
servants of the government, others members of the army, both lived
estranged from the population which they combined to oppress.
Below these were <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">les petits blancs,</hi></foreign> (the small whites,) men of inferior
station, who conducted various kinds of business in the towns and who,
despised by white men more elevated in
<pb id="beard20" n="20"/>
station, repaid themselves by contemning the black population, on the
sweat of whose brows they depended for a livelihood. Contempt is
always most intense and baneful between classes that are nearest
each other.</p>
            <p>From the mixture of black blood and white blood arose a new
class, designated <hi rend="italics">men of colour.</hi> On the part of the planters,
passion and lust were subject to no outward restraint, and rarely
owned any strong inward control. African women sometimes
possess seductive attractions. If in any case these were employed to
mitigate the penalties of servitude, the blame must chiefly be imputed
to the degraded condition in which the system held them; and if when
they had obtained power over their paramours, they, in pride and
jealousy, inflicted on them humiliating punishments, they did but serve
as effectual ministers of well-merited retribution. Content to live in a
state of concubinage, the proprietors could not expect the peaceful and
refining satisfactions of a home; and alas! only too readily took the
consequences of their licentious course in imperious mistresses, and
illegitimate offspring. But vice is its own avenger. From the blood
sprung from this mixed and impure source, came the chief cause of the
troubles and ruin of the planters.</p>
            <p>Some of the men of colour were proprietors of rich possessions; but
neither their wealth, nor the virtues by which they had acquired it,
could procure for them social estimation, Their prosperity excited the
envy of the whites in the lower classes. Though emancipated
by law from the domination of individuals, the free men of colour were
considered as a sort of public property, and as such, were exposed to
the caprices of all the whites. Even before the law they stood on
unequal ground. At the age of thirty they were compelled to serve
three years in a militia, instituted against the Maroon negroes; they
were subject to a special impost for the reparation of the roads; they
were expressly shut out from all public offices, and from the more
honourable professions and pursuits of private life. When they arrived
at the gate of a city, they were required to alight from their horse; they
were disqualified for sitting at a white man's table, for frequenting the
same school, for occupying the same
<pb id="beard21" n="21"/>
place at church, for having the same name, for being interred in the
same cemetery, for receiving the succession of his property. Thus the
son was unable to take his food at his father's board, kneel beside his
father in his devotions, bear his father's name, lie in his father's tomb,
succeed to his father's property,—to such an extent were the rights and
affections of nature reversed and confounded. The disqualification
pursued its victims, until during six consecutive generations the white
blood had become purified from its original stain.</p>
            <p>Among the men of colour existed every various shade. Some had as
fair a complexion as ordinary Europeans; with others, the hue was
nearly as sable as that of the pure negro blood. The <hi rend="italics">mulatto,</hi> offspring
of a white man and a negress, formed the first degree of colour. The
child of a white man by a mulatto woman, was called a <hi rend="italics">quarteroon,</hi>—the
second degree: from a white father and a quarteroon mother, was born
the male<hi rend="italics"> tierceroon</hi>—the third degree: the union of a white man with a
female tierceroon, produced the <hi rend="italics">metif,</hi>—the fourth degree of colour. The
remaining varieties, if named, are barely distinguishable.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref3" n="3" rend="sc" target="note3">*</ref></p>
            <note id="note3" n="3" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref3">* See note A at the end.</note>
            <p>Lamentable is it to think that the troubles we are about to describe,
and which might be designated <hi rend="italics">the war of the skin,</hi> should have flowed
from diversities so slight, variable, evanescent, and every way so
inconsiderable. It would almost seem as if human passions only needed
an excuse, and as if the slightest excuse would serve as a pretext and
a cover for their riotous excesses.</p>
            <p>On their side, the men of colour, labouring under the sense of their
personal and social injuries, tolerated, if they did not encourage in
themselves, low and vindictive passions. Their pride of blood was the
more intense, the less they possessed of the coveted and privileged
colour. Haughty and disdainful towards the blacks, whom they
despised, they were scornful toward the <hi rend="italics">petits blancs,</hi> whom they
hated, and jealous and turbulent toward the planters, whom they
feared. With blood white enough to make them hopeful and aspiring,
they possessed riches
<pb id="beard22" n="22"/>
and social influence enough to make them formidable. By their alliance
with their fathers they were tempted to seek for every thing which was
denied them in consequence of the hue and condition of their mothers.
The mulattoes, therefore, were a hot-bed of dissatisfaction, and a
furnace of turbulence. Aware by their education of the new ideas
which were fermenting in Europe and in the United States, they were
also ever on the watch to seize opportunities to avenge their wrongs,
and to turn every incident to account for improving their social
condition. Unable to endure the dominion of their white parents, they
were indignant at the bare thought of the ascendancy of the negroes;
and while they plotted against the former, were the open, bitter, and
irreconcileable foes of the latter. If the planters repelled the claims of
the negroes' friends, least of all could emancipation be obtained by or
with the aid of the mulattoes.</p>
            <p>Such in general was the condition of society in Hayti, when the first
movements of the great conflict began. On that land of servitude there
were on all sides masters living in pleasure and luxury, women skilled in
the arts of seduction, children abandoned by their fathers or becoming
their cruelest enemies, slaves worn down by toil, sorrow and regrets,
or lacerated and mangled by punishments. Suicide, abortion, poisoning,
revolts and conflagration,—all the vices and crimes which slavery
engenders, became more and more frequent. Thirty slaves freed
themselves together from their wretchedness the same day, and the
same hour; meanwhile thirty thousand whites, freemen, lived in the
midst of twenty thousand emancipated men of colour, and five hundred
thousand slaves. Thus the advantage of numbers and of physical
strength was on the side of the oppressed.</p>

servitude, his marriage; reads Raynal, and begins to think himself the 
providentially-appointed liberator of his oppressed brethren.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN the midst of these conflicting passions and threatening disorders,
there was a character quietly forming, which was to do more than all
others, first to gain the mastery of them, and then to conduct them to
issues of a favourable nature. This superior mind gathered its strength
and matured its purposes in a class of Haytian society where least of
all ordinary men would have looked for it. Who could suppose that the
liberator of the slaves of Hayti, and the great type and pattern of negro
excellence, existed and toiled in one of the despised gangs that pined
away on the plantations of the island?</p>
            <p>The appearance of a hero of negro blood was ardently to be wished,
as affording the best proof of negro capability. By what other than a
negro hand could it be expected that the blow would be struck which
should show to the world that Africans could not only enjoy but gain
personal and social freedom? To the more deep-sighted, the progress
of events and the inevitable tendencies of society had darkly indicated
the coming of a negro liberator. The presentiment found expression in
the words of the philosophic Abbé Raynal, who, in some sort,
predicted that a vindicator of negro wrongs would ere long arise out
of the bosom of the negro race. That prediction had its fulfillment in
Toussaint L'Ouverture.</p>
            <p>Toussaint was a negro. We wish emphatically to mark the fact that
he was wholly without white blood. Whatever he was, and whatever
he did, he achieved all in virtue of qualities which in kind are common
to the African race. Though of negro extraction, Toussaint, if we may
believe family traditions, was not of common origin. His great
grandfather is reported to have been an African king. Whatever
position his ancestors
<pb id="beard24" n="24"/>
held, certain it is that Toussaint had in his soul higher qualities than
noble or royal descent can guarantee.</p>
            <p>The Arradas were a powerful tribe of negroes, eminent for mental
resources, and of an indomitable will, who occupied a part of Western
Africa. In a plundering expedition undertaken by a neighbouring tribe,
a son of the chief of the Arradas was made captive. His name was
Gaou-Guinou. Sold to slave-dealers, he was conveyed to Hayti, and
became the property of the Count de Breda, who owned a sugar
manufactory some two miles from Cap François. More fortunate than
most of his race in their servitude, he found among his fellow-slaves
fellow countrymen by whom he was recognised, and from whom he
received tokens of the respect which they judged due to his rank. The
Count de Breda was a humane man ; as such he took care to entrust
his slaves to none but humane superintendants. At the time the
plantation of the Count de Breda was directed by M. Bayou de
Libertas, a Frenchman of mild character, who, contrary to the general
practice, studied his employer's interests without overloading his hands
with immoderate labour.</p>
            <p>Under him Gaou-Guinou was less unhappy than his companions in
misfortune. It is not known that his master was aware of his superior
position in his native country, but facts stated by Isaac, one of Toussaint
L'Ouverture's sons, make the supposition not improbable. His
grandfather, he reports, enjoyed full liberty on the states of his
proprietor, He was also allowed to employ five slaves to cultivate a
portion of land which had been assigned to him. He became a member
of the Catholic Church, the religion of the rulers of Western Hayti, and
married a woman who was not only virtuous but beautiful. The
husband and the wife died nearly at the same time, leaving five male
children and three female. The eldest of his sons was Toussaint-L'Ouverture.</p>
            <p>These particulars illustrative of the superiority of Toussaint's
family, are neither without interest nor without importance. If, strictly
speaking, virtues are not transmissible, virtuous tendencies, and
certainly intellectual aptitudes, may pass from
<pb id="beard25" n="25"/>
parents to children. And the facts narrated may serve to show how it
was that Toussaint was not sunk in that mental stagnation and moral
depravity of which slavery is commonly the parent.</p>
            <p>As might be expected, the exact day and year of Toussaint's birth
are not known. It is said to have been the 20th of May, 1743. What is
of more importance is that he lived fifty years of his life in slavery
before he became prominent as the vindicator of his brethren's rights.
In that long space he had full time to become acquainted with their
sufferings as well as their capabilities, and to form such deliberate
resolutions as, when the time for action came, should not be likely to
fail of effect. Yet does it seem a late period in a man's life for so great
an undertaking; nor could any one endowed with inferior powers have
approached to the accomplishment of the task.</p>
            <p>Throughout his arduous and perilous career, Toussaint
L'Ouverture found great support himself, and exerted great
influence over others, in virtue of his deep and pervading sense
of religion. We might almost declare that from that source he
derived more power than from all others. The foundation of
his religious sentiments was laid in his childhood.</p>
            <p>There lived in the neighbourhood of the Gaou-Guinou family a
black esteemed for the purity and probity of his character, and who
was not devoid of knowledge. His name was Pierre Baptiste. He was
acquainted with French, and had a smattering of Latin, as well as some
notions of Geometry. For his education he was indebted to the
goodness of one of those missionaries who, in preaching the morality of
a Divine religion, enlighten and enlarge the minds of their disciples.
Pierre Baptiste became the godfather of Toussaint. Holding that
relation to the child, he thought it his duty to communicate to him the
instructions and impressions he had received from his own religious
teacher. Continuing to speak his native African tongue, which was
used in his family, Toussaint acquired from his godfather some
acquaintance with the French, and aided by the services of the
Catholic Church, made a few steps in the knowledge of the Latin.
With a love of country which ancestral recollections
<pb id="beard26" n="26"/>
and domestic intimacies cherished, he took pleasure in reverting 
to the traditional histories of the land of his sires. From these
Pierre-Baptiste laboured to direct his young mind and heart to
loftier and purer examples consecrated in the records of the
Christian Church.</p>
            <p>This course of instruction was of greater value than any skill
in the outward processes which are too commonly identified
with education. The young negro, however, seems to have
made some progress in the arts of reading, writing and drawing.
A scholar, in the higher sense of the term, he never became;
and at an advanced period of life, when his knowledge was
great and various, he regarded the instruction which he received
in boyhood as very inconsiderable. Undoubtedly, in the pure
and noble inspirations of his moral nature, Toussaint had
instructors far more rich in knowledge and impulse than any
pedagogue could have been. Yet in his youth were the foundations
laid in external learning of value to the man, the general,
and the legislator. It is true, that in the composition of his
letters and addresses, he enjoyed the assistance of a cultivated
secretary. Nevertheless, if the form was another's, the thought
was his own; nor would he allow a document to pass from his
hands, until, by repeated perusals and numerous corrections, he
had brought the general tenour, and each particular expression,
into conformity with his own thoughts and his own purpose.
Nor is there required anything more than an attentive reading
of his extant compositions, to be assured of the superior mental
powers with which he was endowed.</p>
            <p>In his mature years, and in the days of his great conflict,
Toussaint possessed an iron frame and a stout arm. Capable of
almost any amount of labour and endurance, he was terrible in
battle, and rarely struck without deadly effect. Yet in his
childhood he was weak and infirm to such a degree, that for a 
long time his parents doubted of being able to preserve his existence.
So delicate was his constitution that he received the descriptive
appellation of Fatrâs-Baton, which might be rendered in
English by <hi rend="italics">Little Lath.</hi> But with increase of years the stripling
hardened and strengthened his frame by the severest labours
<pb id="beard27" n="27"/>
and the most violent exercises. At the age of twelve he surpassed
all his equals in the plantation in bodily feats. Who so
swift in hunting? who so clever to swim across a foaming
torrent? who so skilful to back a horse in full speed, and direct
him at his will? The spirit of the man was already working
in the boy.</p>
            <p>The duty of the young slaves was definite and uniform. They
were entrusted with the care of the flocks and herds. As a
solitary and moral occupation, a shepherd's life gives time and
opportunity for tranquil meditation. By nature Fatras-Bâton 
was given to thought. His reflective and taciturn disposition
found appropriate nutriment on the rich uplands and under the
brilliant skies of the land of his birth. Accustomed to think
much more than he spoke, he acquired not only self-control,
but also the power of concentrated reflection and concise speech,
which, late in life, was one of his most marked and most
serviceable characteristics.</p>
            <p>Pastoral occupations are favourable to an acquaintance with
vegetable products. Toussaint's father, like other Africans, was
familiar with the healing virtues of many plants. These the
old man explained to his son, whose knowledge expanded in the
monotonous routine of his daily task. Thus did he obtain a
rude familiarity with simples, of which he afterwards made a 
practical application. In this period, when the youth was
passing into the man, and when, as with all thoughtful persons,
the mind becomes sensitively alive to things to come as well as
to things present, Toussaint may have formed the first dim
conception of the misery of servitude, and the need of a liberator.
At present he lived with his fellow-sufferers in those narrow,
low, and foul huts where regard to decency was impossible; he
heard the twang of the driver's whip, and saw the blood streaming
from the negro's body; he witnessed the separation of 
parents and children, and was made aware, by too many proofs,
that in slavery neither home nor religion could accomplish its
purposes. Not impossibly, then, it was at this time that he
first discerned the image of a distant duty rising before his
mind's eye; and as the future liberator unquestionably lay in
<pb id="beard28" n="28"/>
his soul, the latent thought may at times have started forth, and for a
moment occupied his consciousness. The means, indeed, do not exist
by which we may certainly ascertain when he conceived the idea of
becoming the avenger of his people's wrongs; but several intimations
point to an early period in his life. His good conduct in his pastoral 
engagements procured for him an advancement. Bayou de Libertas, convinced 
of his diligence and fidelity, made him his coachman. This was an office of
importance in the eyes of the slaves; certainly it was one which
brought some comfort and some means of self-improvement.</p>
            <p>Though Toussaint became every day more and more aware that he
was a slave, and experienced many of the evils of his condition, yet,
with the aid of religion, he avoided a murmuring spirit, and wisely
employed his opportunities to make the best of the position in which he
had been born, without, however, yielding to the degrading notion that
his hardships were irremediable. Sustained by a sense of duty which
was even stronger than his hope of improving his condition, he
performed his daily task in a composed if not a contented spirit, and so,
constantly, won the confidence of the overseer. The result was his
promotion to a place of trust. He was made steward of the implements
employed in sugar-making.</p>
            <p>Arrived at adult age, Toussaint began to think of marriage. His race
at large he saw living in concubinage. As a religious man he was
forbidden by his conscience to enter into such a relation. As a humane
man he shrunk from the numerous evils which he knew concubinage
entailed. Whom should he choose? Already had he risen above the silly
preferences of form and feature. Reality he wanted, and the only real
good in a wife, he was assured, lay in good sense, good feeling, and
good manners. These qualities he found in a widow well skilled in
husbandry, a house-slave in the plantation. The kind-hearted and
industrious Suzan became his lawful wife according to “God's holy
ordinance and the law of the land.” By a man of colour Suzan had had
a son, named Placide. Obeying the generous impulses of his heart,
Toussaint adopted the youth,
<pb id="beard29" n="29"/>
who ever retained the most lively sense of gratitude towards his
benefactor.</p>
            <p>Toussaint was now a happy man, considering his condition as a
slave—the husband of a slave—a very happy man. His position 
gave him privileges, and he had a heart to enjoy them. His leisure hours 
he employed in cultivating a garden, which he was allowed to call his
own. In those pleasing engagements he was not without a companion.
“We went,” he said to a traveler, “we went to labour in the fields, my
wife and I, hand in hand. Scarcely were we conscious of the fatigues
of the day. Heaven always blessed our toil. Not only we swam in
abundance, but we had the pleasure of giving food to blacks who
needed it. On the Sabbath and on festival days we went to church—my
wife, my parents, and myself. Returning to our cottage, after a
pleasant meal, we passed the remainder of the day as a family, and
we closed it by prayer, in which all took part.” Thus can religion
convert a desert into a garden, and make a slave's cabin the abode of
the purest happiness on earth.</p>
            <p>Bent as Toussaint was on the improvement of his condition, he yet
did not employ the personal property which ensued from his own and
his wife's thrift, in purchasing his liberty, and elevating himself and
family into the higher class of men of colour. His reasons for remaining
a slave are not recorded. He may have felt no attractions towards a
class whose superiority was more nominal than real. He may have
resolved to remain in a class whose emancipation he hoped some day
to achieve.</p>
            <p>The virtues of his character procured for Toussaint universal
respect. He was esteemed and loved even by the free blacks. The
great planters held him in consideration. His intellectual faculties
ripened under the effects of his intercourse with free and white men.
As he grew in mind and became large of heart, he more and more
was puzzled and distressed with the institution of slavery; he could in
no way understand how the hue of the skin should put so great a
social and personal distance between men whom God, he saw, had
made essentially the same, and whom he knew to be useful if not
indispensable to each
<pb id="beard30" n="30"/>
other. Naturally he asked himself what others had thought and
said of slavery. He had heard passages recited from Raynal.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref4" n="4" rend="sc" target="note4">*</ref>

Européens dans les Deux Indes, par G. T. Raynal. Geneva; 1780.</note>He procured the work. And now he found how much is 
involved in the simple art of reading. Toussaint could read,—
Toussaint did read. He read passages similar to what follows,
and he became the vindicator of negro freedom:—</p>
            <p>“Scarcely had domestic liberty revived in Europe, when it was
entombed in America. The Spaniard, whom the waves first threw on
the shores of the New World, believed himself under no obligation to
its inhabitants, for they had not his colour, or his customs, or his
religion. He saw in them only his instruments, and he loaded them with
chains. Those feeble men, unused to toil, soon perished from the
vapours of the mines, and other occupations almost as baneful. Then
arose a demand for slaves from Africa. Their numbers increased in
proportion as cultivation extended. The Portuguese, the Dutch, the
English, the French, the Danes—all nations, whether free or in serfdom,
remorselessly sought an augmentation of fortune in the sweat, in the
blood, in the despair of these poor wretches;—what a frightful system!</p>
            <p>“Liberty is everyone's own property. There are three kinds of
liberty—natural liberty, civil liberty, political liberty; that is to say, the
liberty of the man, the liberty of the citizen, and the liberty of the
community. Natural liberty is the right, which nature has given to
every one to dispose of himself according. to his own will. Civil liberty
is the right which society ought to guarantee to every citizen to do all
that is not contrary to the laws. Political liberty is the condition of a
people which has not alienated its own sovereignty, and which makes
its own laws, or which is in part associated in its legislation.</p>
            <p>“The first of these liberties is, next to reason, the distinctive
characteristic of man. We subdue and enchain the brute, because it
has no notion of justice or injustice—no idea of greatness and
degradation. But in me liberty is the principle of my
<figure id="ill3" entity="beard30"><p>TOUSSAINT READING THE ABBÉ RAYNAL'S WORK</p></figure><pb id="beard31" n="31"/>
vices and my virtues. It is only the free man who can say,<hi rend="italics"> I will,</hi> or,
<hi rend="italics">I will not;</hi> and who can, consequently, be worthy of praise and blame.
Without liberty, or the possession of one's own body and the
enjoyment of one's own mind, there is neither husband, father, relation
nor friend; we have no country, no fellow-citizen, no God. The slave,
an instrument in the hands of wickedness, is below the dog which the
Spaniard let loose against the American; for conscience, which the dog
lacks, remains with the man. He who basely resigns his liberty, devotes
himself to remorse and to the greatest misery that a sensible and
thinking creature can experience. If there is no power under heaven
that can change my organisation, and convert me into a brute, there is
none that can dispose of my liberty. God is my Father and not my
master. I am his child, not his slave. How, then, could I accord to political 
power that I which I refuse to Divine omnipotence?</p>
            <p>“These are immovable and eternal truths—the foundation of all
morality, the basis of all government will they be contested? Yes! and
it will be a barbarous and sordid avarice which will commit the
audacious homicide. Cast your eye on that ship-owner, who, bent over
his desk, regulates, with pen in hand, the number of crimes which he
may commit on the coast of Guinea; who, at his leisure, examines what
number of muskets will be needed to obtain a negro, what number of
chains to hold him bound on board his vessel, what number of whips to
make him work: who coolly calculates how much will cost him each
drop of the blood with which his slave will water his plantation who
discusses whether the negress will give more or less to his estate by
the labours of her feeble hands than by the dangers of child-birth. You
shudder?—ah! if there existed a religion which tolerated, which
authorized, if only by its silence, horrors like these; if, occupied with idle
or contentious questions, it did not ceaselessly thunder against the
authors or the instruments of this tyranny; if it made it a crime for the
slave to break his chains; if it suffered in its bosom the unjust judge
who condemned the fugitive to death;—if this religion existed, would it
not be necessary that its altars should be broken down and left
<pb id="beard32" n="32"/>
in ruins? Who are you who will dare to justify crimes against my
independence, on the ground that you are the stronger? What! he who
makes me a slave not guilty? He makes use of his rights? What, then,
are those rights? Who has given them a character sacred enough to put
my rights to silence? I hold from nature the right of self-defence; she
has not given you the right to attack me. If you think yourself
authorized to oppress me because you are stronger and more alert than
I, do not complain when, after my hand becomes vigorous, it shall
plant a dagger in your heart; do not complain when you shall feel in
your veins that death which I shall have mingled with your food. Now I
am the stronger and the more alert, it is your turn to be the victim;
expiate the crime of having been an oppressor.</p>
            <p>“ ‘But,’ it is said, ‘slavery has been generally established in all
countries and in all ages.’ True;—but what consequence is it what other
nations have done in other ages? Ought the appeal to be to customs or
to conscience? Is it interest, blindness, barbarity, or reason and justice,
that we ought to listen to? If the universality of a practice proved its
innocence, the apology of usurpations, conquests, and oppression of all
kinds would irrefutably be completed.</p>
            <p>“ ‘But the ancients,’ you say, ‘thought themselves masters of the
lives of their slaves; we, having become more humane, dispose only of
their liberty and their labour.’ It is true, the progress of knowledge has
on this important point given light to modern legislators. All codes,
without an exception, have taken precautions to guard the life of even
the man who pines away in servitude. They have put his existence
under the protection of the magistrate. But has this, the most sacred of
social institutions, ever had its due force? Is not America peopled with
colonists who, usurping sovereign rights, inflict death on the
unfortunate victims of their avarice? But suppose the law observed,
would the slave materially gain thereby? Does not the master who
employs my strength, dispose of my life, which depends on the
voluntary and moderate use of my faculties? What is existence for
him who has no property in it? I cannot kill my slave, but I may cause
his blood to flow drop by drop under the drivers whip; I may
overwhelm him with
<pb id="beard33" n="33"/>
labours, privations, and pains; I may on all sides attack and slowly
undermine the resources of his life; I may stifle by slow punishments
the wretched embryo that a negress bears in her womb. It might be
said that the laws protect the slave against a speedy death, only to
leave to my cruelty the right of killing him in the course of time. In
truth, the right of slavery is the right to commit crimes of all kinds.</p>
            <p>“ ‘But the negroes are a sort of men born for slavery: they are of
narrow minds, mischievous, deceitful; they themselves own the
superiority of our intelligence, and almost recognise the justice of our
dominion!’</p>
            <p>“The negroes are of narrow minds because slavery destroys all the
springs of the soul. They are mischievous,—not mischievous enough
with you. They are deceitful, because they owe no fidelity to their
tyrants. They acknowledge the superiority of our intelligence, because
we have perpetuated their ignorance; the justice of our dominion,
because we have abused their weakness. In the impossibility of
maintaining our superiority by force, a criminal policy has had recourse
to guile. You have almost got so far as to persuade them that they are
an exceptional race, born for subjection and dependence, for labour
and punishment. You have neglected nothing to degrade those
unhappy creatures, and you reproach them with being vile.</p>
            <p>“‘But these negroes were born slaves.’—Whom will you cause to
believe that a man can be the property of a sovereign? a son the
property of a father? a woman the property of a husband? a domestic
the property of a master? a negro the property of a planter? The
contempt with which you treat them falls back upon yourself. You
have no ground of self-respect but what is common to you with them.
A common Father, an immortal soul, a future life—here is your true
glory, and here is their glory.</p>
            <p>“ ‘But the government itself authorizes the sale of slaves.’—
Whence this right? However absolute the magistrate, is he the
proprietor of the subjects of his empire? Has he any other 
authority than such as he derives from the citizens? And can
any nation give the privilege of disposing of its liberty?</p>
            <p>“‘But the slave sold himself of his own accord.’—If he belongs
<pb id="beard34" n="34"/>
to himself, he has the right to dispose of himself. If he is master of his
life, why should he not be master of his liberty? Man has not the right
to sell himself, because he has not the right to accede to whatever an
unjust, violent, and depraved master may exact from him. He belongs
to his first master—God, by whom he has never been emancipated. He
who sells himself enters into an illusory agreement with his purchaser;
for thereby he loses all his value. At the moment when he receives the price and the money become the property of the buyer. The very act of selling
yourself, vitiates the bargain. He who sells himself is a fool, not a slave.</p>
            <p>“‘But those slaves were taken in war, and but for us would have
been slaughtered.’</p>
            <p>“‘But for you would there have been fighting? Are not the
dissensions of those tribes your work? Did you not carry to them
murderous arms? Did you not give them the blind desire to employ
them? And why did you not allow the conqueror to use his victory as
he pleased? Why become his accomplice?</p>
            <p>“ ‘But they were criminals condemned to death or slavery in their
own country.’ Are you, then, Africa's executioners. Besides, who were
their judges? Do you not know that under a despotism there is only one
criminal—the despot himself? The subject of a despot, like the slave, is in
a condition contrary to nature. Whatever contributes to retain man in
that condition, is a crime against his person. Every hand which binds
man to the tyranny of a single person, is the hand of an enemy. Do
you wish to know who are the authors and accomplices of this
violence? Those who are around it. The tyrant can do nothing by
himself.</p>
            <p>“ ‘But they are happier in America than they were in Africa.’ Why,
then, do they continually sigh for their native land? Why do they resume
their liberty as soon as they can? Why do they prefer deserts and the society of wild beasts, to a state which appears to you so agreeable? Why does their despair induce them to put an end to themselves, or to poison you? Why do their wives so often procure abortion? When you tell us of the happiness of
your slaves, you lie to yourselves, and you deceive us. It is the height of extravagance to attempt to transform so barbarous an act into an act of humanity.
<pb id="beard35" n="35"/>
“ ‘But in Europe as in America the people are slaves. The sole
advantage which we have over the negroes is the power of breaking
one chain to fall under another.’ Too true. Most nations are oppressed.
Scarcely is there a country in which a man can flatter himself with
being master of his person, of  disposing of his inheritance at his will, of
enjoying peaceably the fruits of his industry. But as morality and wise
polity shall make progress, men will recover their rights. Why, in
waiting for the happy day, should there be miserable races to whom
you refuse even the consoling and honourable name of <hi rend="italics">free men;</hi> from
whom you snatch even the hope of obtaining it, notwithstanding the
changeableness of events? No, whatever may be said, the condition of
those unfortunate beings is not the same as ours.</p>
            <p>“The last argument employed to justify slavery says, that
‘slavery is the only way of conducting the negroes to eternal
blessedness by means of Christian baptism.’</p>
            <p>“Mild and loving Jesus! could you have foreseen that your
benign maxims would be employed to justify so much horror?
If the Christian religion thus authorized avarice in governments,
it would be necessary for ever to proscribe its dogmas. In order
to overturn the edifice of slavery, to what tribunal shall we carry
the cause of humanity? Kings, refuse the seal of your authority
to the infamous traffic which converts men into beasts. But what
do I say? Let us look somewhere else. If self-interest alone
prevails with nations and their masters, there is another power.
Nature speaks in louder tones than philosophy or self-interest.
Already are there established two colonies of fugitive negroes,
whom treaties and power protect from assault. Those lightnings 
announce the thunder. A courageous chief only is wanted. Where 
is he? that great man whom Nature owes to her vexed, oppressed, and tormented children. Where is he? He will appear, doubt it not; he 
will come forth, and raise the sacred standard of liberty. This venerable 
signal will gather around him the companions of his misfortune. More impetuous than the torrents, they will everywhere leave the indelible traces
of their just resentment. Everywhere people will bless the name
<pb id="beard36" n="36"/>

race; everywhere will they raise trophies in his honour.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref5" n="5" rend="sc" target="note5">*</ref></p>

            <p>These eloquent words must have produced a deep and pervading
impression on a mind so susceptible as that of Toussaint.
Here reason and feeling were harmonized into one awful appeal.
Here philosophy joined with common sense and common justice,
to proclaim negro wrongs, and to call for a negro vindicator.
That call Toussaint heard; he heard its voice in his inmost
soul; he heard it there first in low reverberations; he heard it
there at last in sounds of thunder. Dwelling on those principles,
pondering those words, consulting his own heart, and reflecting on
his own condition, he came in time to feel that <hi rend="italics">he</hi> was the man
here designated, and that in the designation there was a call from
Providence which he dared not disregard. But the time was not yet.
Conviction must wait on opportunity. Besides, Toussaint
was a religious man. Religion was his highest law. In one
sense religion was his only law, for it comprehended every other
form of law. What said religion? Read again, noble black;
read with your own eyes; read the Bible for yourself and by
yourself. Yes, if you will, consult the priest; but in retiring
from the confessional, let Raynal's words echo in your ears, and
fear lest you betray Christianity, even while striving to learn
and obey its law.</p>

            <argument>
              <p>Toussaint's presumed scriptural studies—The Mosaic code—Christian
principles adverse to slavery—Christ, Paul, the Epistle to Philemon.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IT is not to be supposed that Toussaint read the sacred Scriptures
with a critical eye. Unversed in the science of Biblical interpretation,
he could do no more than receive such impressions as certain great
outstanding facts were fitted to produce. Nor,
<pb id="beard37" n="37"/>
however valuable for its own purposes a scientific acquaintance
with the Divine Word may be, did he need more than he and
every other sensible person could gather from the general tenour
and prominent aims of the Bible. There might even be particular
passages which he was unable to comprehend in the harmony
of scriptural truth, and a religious disputant might have
found no great difficulty in presenting to his mind considerations
wearing on the surface an appearance adverse to his general
convictions. But those convictions would rest on such broad and
deep foundations, and occupy in his mind so large a space; they
would in themselves be so full, and so vivid, and so far-reaching,
that as he reflected on them more and more, and they thus
became an integral element in his mind, he could in no way
doubt that slavery was disallowed by the Bible, and was adverse
to the genius, the aims, and the operation of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Slavery, it is true, he found in the Scriptures. But how?
Not as an institution of Divine origin. Moses found slavery in
common practice; and unable to abolish it, did his best to mitigate
its evils. And the system of servitude which he left
rather than sanctioned, involved none of those atrocities which
make American slavery so offensive and so baneful. The aim
and tendency of slavery among the Hebrews, was the improvement
 of such as were under the yoke. Being of foreign extraction 
for the most part, slaves were permitted to enter ‘the
commonwealth of Israel,’ by undergoing the distinctive rite of
circumcision. (Gen. xvii. 23, 27.) Thus raised from a slave into
a Hebrew, the slave had before him a brightening future, and
could share in the privilege, and partake of the advantages,
of worshipping the Creator of heaven and earth. Like England,
Canaan was a land of refuge for slaves. The moment they
touched that sacred soil they were free. Fugitive slaves could
in no wise by delivered up to their masters, nor might they be
reduced into bondage by Israelites. They chose their own
residence, and followed their own pursuits. (Deut. xxiii. 16, <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">et seq.</hi></foreign>)
Expressly was it forbidden that a Hebrew should sell himself to a 
fellow-Hebrew as a bond-servant, and if one Hebrew hired
himself to another Hebrew, he with his children obtained
<pb id="beard38" n="38"/>
his liberty unconditionally at the end of six years at the furthest,
or at the jubilee next ensuing after his service began. (Lev. xxv.
39,40.) And he might be redeemed at an earlier day by either 
himself or a relative. (Lev. xxv. 48,49.) Even thieves, who,
when detected, were, in consequence of not being able to make
compensation, put into servitude to Israelites, benefited by the
laws regarding emancipation. As it was not permitted to send
back or enslave a fugitive slave of foreign blood, so was it unlawful
to sell a Hebrew to a foreign master. (Exod. xxi. 7—11)</p>
            <p>These facts are the more striking, when we take into account
the general practice of the slave trade in the ancient Eastern 
world. Egypt, which lay on the borders of Palestine, was a
great slave mart. The long sea-board of Palestine afforded
peculiar facilities for the detestable traffic. Streams of wealth
would have poured into the land, had Israel encouraged the
trade. The temptation was great. But religion was too strong
for cupidity, and the people of God disallowed the commerce in
human flesh generally, and modified their prescriptive usages so
as to abate the evils and diminish the observance of slavery in
their own territories.</p>
            <p>Among the mitigations of their lot guaranteed to slaves by
Moses were the following:—1. Entire rest from labour every
seventh day. (Exod. xx. 10.) Noble recognition of man's religious
nature and religious wants! 2. Immunity from deadly or cruel
punishments. If a servant lost an eye or a tooth from a blow
given by his master, he was thereon rendered free; if a slave
died under a master's hand, the master underwent due retribution.
(Exod. xxi. 20, <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">et seq.</hi></foreign>) When advocates of slavery as it is
in the United States cite in argument the Mosaic institutions,
they would do well to give special attention to these merciful
regulations. 3. Slaves were to join the Hebrew family in their 
rejoicings on occasions of religious festivity. (Deut. xii. 12,
18; xvi. 11, 14.) 4. Slaves recovered their freedom in the year
of jubilee, and the bondman was not to go away with empty
hands: “Thou shalt furnish him liberally our of thy flock, and
out of thy flour, and out of thy winepress.” The reason assigned
is forcible; “Thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in
<pb id="beard39" n="39"/>
the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee. (Deut.
xv.  13 <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">et seq</hi></foreign>.; compare Exod. xxi. 2—4.) 5. A servant might not
wish to leave his master's house; having been treated well, he
had formed attachments and become one of the family: “If,
therefore, he shall plainly say, I love my master, I will not go out
free, then shall his master bring him unto the judges;” and his
will being ascertained by a judicial investigation, he was permitted
to remain in his own freely-chosen condition of domestic servitude.
(Exod. xxi. 5,6.) 6. A Hebrew bondsman was allowed to acquire and 
hold property, with which he might purchase his
freedom. (Lev. xxxv. 49.) 7. If a master had no sons, a Hebrew
slave might aspire to his daughter's hand. (I Chron. ii., 35.)<ref targOrder="U" id="ref6" n="6" rend="sc" target="note6">*</ref></p>
            <note id="note6" n="6" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref6">* Consult under the word bondage,“The People's Dictionary of the Bible,“
2 vols. 8vo., third Edition, by the author.</note>
            <p>On reviewing the features of the Mosaic slave code, could
Toussaint for a moment identify its provisions with the <hi rend="italics">Code Noir</hi>
of Louis XIV., or with the system practised in Hayti? The contrast
was too evident. Then did Toussaint see a slave, in some
happy year of jubilee, going forth from bondage with a liberal
supply from his master's flock, his master's barn, and his master's
wine-cellar? Did he himself ever even think of asking for the hand,
not of his master's daughter, but of his master's steward's
daughter? Did he ever witness even a slave-driver punished
for cruelly treating a slave? Could he point to a neighbouring
land whose very air gave a slave his freedom the moment he
breathed it? Did Spanish Hayti refuse to deliver up fugitive
slaves to French Hayti, and did French Hayti refuse to deliver
up fugitive slaves to Spanish Hayti?</p>
            <p>But, it is objected, Christianity finding slavery in existence, did
not proscribe it. Christianity did more than proscribe slavery—it
undermined slavery; and wherever it prevailed in deed rather
than profession, it brought slavery to the ground. The objection,
if rightly stated, is this, and nothing more—namely, that the
original promulgators of the Gospel did not commence an active 
and open crusade against slavery. The reason is, that they had
an object before them higher than any immediate good. They 
waged no war against Roman despotism. They left, even on
<pb id="beard40" n="40"/>
their native hills, the degenerate family of Herod in undisturbed
possession of power. Their mission was not to remodel
institutions, but to reform society. Their work was not to reap 
a premature and perishing harvest, but to sow the seed of
quickening principles and imperishable sympathies. Disregarding
thrones, principalities, and dominions, they went forth to
preach the word of a new individual life, well aware that the
acorn, in due time, would become an oak. Nor were their 
efforts nugatory. Within three centuries slavery was abolished
in the Roman empire. And at this moment—such is the
extensive and ever-living power of the Gospel—slavery, throughout
the world, is tottering to its fall.</p>
            <p>But chiefly, when he meditated on the words and the objects
of the Saviour of the world, did Toussaint feel how incompatible
slavery was with Christianity. Had he not, in those impressive
words, “where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty.”
(2 Cor. iii. 17,) found the enunciation of a great Christian
principle, and the announcement of a great Christian power, which 
must of necessity, as it was designed, break asunder every outward
bond and emancipate every slave on earth? And in what terms did 
the Lord himself announce his mission? Toussaint, in
thought, made one of his auditors in that small synagogue at
Nazareth, where the Redeemer of men astounded his townsfolk
and relatives by declaring, in words of the widest import,
as he ushered in the grand spiritual jubilee, and so gave to all
the subjects of His new kingdom liberty of body in giving
them liberty of soul: “The Spirit of Jehovah is upon me,
because He hath anointed me to preach glad tidings to the poor,
He hath sent me to declare <hi rend="italics">deliverance to the captives,</hi> and recovery
of sight to the blind; to set at liberty those that are oppressed;
to proclaim the acceptable year of Jehovah.” “To-day is this
Scripture fulfilled in your ears.” (Luke iv. 18, <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">et seq.</hi></foreign>) Unmistakable
must Toussaint have found the import of these words. The great year 
of jubilee had come—the slave was free—slavery was abolished;
not only that corporeal slavery which Moses tolerated, but
the heavier slavery; which man, in consequence of sin, endured;—
slavery of soul and, consequently, slavery of body was
abrogated and destroyed. The blow 
<pb id="beard41" n="41"/>
was struck, and the dark edifice would inevitably fall. How 
could Toussaint hear from the lips of Christ himself that 
he came expressly to deliver the captive, and set the oppressed 
at liberty, without feeling that if he yielded to the grand thought 
which already swelled his breast, and became the liberator of 
the negro race, he would thereby be not a follower only, but a 
fellow-worker with “the Lord from heaven?” How could he 
learn, on infallible authority, that God, who had “made of one 
blood all nations,” (Acts xvii. 26,) had, in his Son, opened and 
proclaimed the year of universal jubilee, and therefore, 
inaugurated the period of universal emancipation; and yet, with his 
convictions and sympathies, fail to conclude that on him too had, 
by the hand of Providence, been devolved a share in the truly 
religious task of liberating and upraising a cruelly oppressed and 
deeply injured tribe?</p>
            <p>If from the Master, Toussaint turned to the greatest of 
his disciples, and asked Paul what, on this point, were the 
principles of the religion of Jesus, he learned that while the 
apostle urged no one in actual circumstances to hurry from 
the condition in which he was born, and judged that it was
better to endure wrong than prematurely, and to the peril of the
cause of Christ, disturb existing relations, and thereby convulse 
society already fearfully agitated, yet he recognised as equally 
members of the Christian church, and accessible to the same 
rights, immunities, and privileges, the bond and the free; 
(2 Cor. xii. 13;) and viewing the whole of human kind as divided 
into these two classes—in their high relations to God arid Christ 
and each other, declared that all outward distinctions had 
ceased, and must practically, in time, come to an end, for that 
there was no longer bond or free, any more than Barbarian or 
Scythian, but all were “one in Christ Jesus.” (Gal. iii. 28; 
Col. iii. 11.) What! could the glowing terms in which the 
apostle—returning again and again to the subject, as if his soul
was on fire with the thought—sets forth not only the equality 
of all the tribes of earth, but their essential unity;—could those
terms be heard by the Roman slave in the primitive church, and 
not make his bosom swell and glow with the idea that he too 
was a man, that he too was free, that he too was comprehended
<pb id="beard42" n="42"/>
in “the redemption which was in Christ Jesus?” And that 
idea once deep in his bosom, the rupture of his material bonds 
was merely an affair of time. Men, who know that they are 
<hi rend="italics">men,</hi> cannot long be hold in bondage. Conscious children of 
God will not be slaves to selfish and brutal men. Those who 
feel that they have been purchased by Christ, the Son of God, 
may indeed “bide their time,” but cannot be permanently held 
in the degrading and polluting condition of slavery. Yes, wisely 
for your own bad purposes, do ye, slave masters, keep the light 
of divine truth from your unhappy victims, or permit them to 
see it only through the discolouring medium of a ministration 
which stoops to make a gain of godliness; wisely for your own 
purposes do ye keep the Bible a scaled book on your plantations, 
or set hirelings to pervert its glorious and emancipating tidings; 
for otherwise your dominion would be shorter than in God's 
providence it is intended to be. But the day cometh; “the Lord 
is at hand.”</p>
            <p>You point me to the conduct of Paul? You tell me 
that Paul sent back Onesimus into slavery? You ask me if 
Toussaint in his scriptural studies comprised the Epistle to 
Philemon? and you triumphantly intimate that, by that 
example, his emancipating ardour ought to have been checked. I 
reply that the Epistle to Philemon is a plea against slavery; 
that if Toussaint comprehended what he read, he would thereby 
be greatly confirmed and built up in his righteous and most
Christian purposes; and that if your own eyes were only free 
from the scales of prejudice and mistaken self-interest, they too 
would discern, in that letter, principles which are utterly inconsistent 
with the continuance of the abominable system of which 
you are the supporters.</p>
            <p>The Epistle of Paul to Philemon is the most pregnant of 
compositions. Never was so much meaning compressed into so few
words. And then, how weighty the topics. How much of
doctrine is there in those few verses; how much of history. And
the doctrine and the history are so presented, that while you
cannot deny the history, you are encouraged to receive the
doctrine. The letter is a series of implications;—implied facts,
<pb id="beard43" n="43"/>
implied principles, implied duties, implied changes and triumphs, 
set forth in all the unconscious simplicity of a private and 
confidential communication, so as to conciliate attention and win 
belief. I hold this short Epistle to be of itself an antidote to 
scepticism and a confutation of slavery.</p>
            <p>The letter, I have intimated, is a series of implications. It is 
also a group of pictures. First mark that fugitive slave hurrying 
from Colossæ, in Asia Minor, down to the shores of the Mediterranean 
sea. What a fell expression of countenance he has, as of 
one who, if well-endowed by nature, had been made bad by 
servitude, and who had had long and varied practice in misdoing. 
How stealthy are his steps, how clownish, yet how timid his 
manner! Ever and anon he casts back his anxious eyes as if he 
feared pursuit, and from the face of every one whom he
encounters, he turns away, as if he dreaded to be recognised. At 
last, reaching the sea, he hastens on ship-board, and concealing
himself in the most secret part of the vessel, effects his escape, 
and is carried to Rome,—that city which the greatest of 
ancient historians has described as the common sink of the 
world.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref7" n="7" rend="sc" target="note7">*</ref></p>
            <note id="note7" n="7" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref7">* Tac. Ann, xv. 44. <foreign lang="lat">Quo cuncta undique atrocia aut pudenda confluunt, 
celebranturque.</foreign></note>
            <p>Let a few years pass, and you may see the same person on his 
way back from Rome to Asia Minor and Colossæ. No longer 
do his movements betray fear. No longer does his countenance 
betoken ferocity. His steps are equable and firm. His manner 
discloses self-respect. He is returning with as much composure 
as determination, and on his way be receives and returns greetings 
with gentleness and confidence, as if he feared none, and 
wished to be friendly with all. And now that he is again on 
ship-board, mark how pure and refined is the expression of his 
face, how manly his whole bearing, as, no longer shunning the 
light, he walks up and down the deck, and has a good word for 
every one. Is this indeed the same person? It is Onesimus, the 
runaway slave. And he is going back to his master of his 
own accord. Yes, hundreds of miles does he travel on foot and
<pb id="beard44" n="44"/>
by sea in order to return into bondage. Observe, he is
unaccompanied. He is unmanacled; not by force, but by his own free 
will, is he led back to his proprietor Philemon in Colossæ.</p>
            <p>Whence these changes? In order to understand them, you must
form to yourselves another picture. There, in a small house in
that narrow and secluded street of Rome, you behold an aged
man, bound with a chain to that pretorian soldier, under whose
custody he is night and day. That aged man is Paul the apostle
of Jesus Christ; there, in that corrupt and guilty city, to answer, 
at the peril of his life, for daring to offer the Gospel to his
countrymen in Jerusalem. Mean in person, and rude in speech,
he has nevertheless preached Christ crucified with great success
to the citizens. But he is oppressed with infirmities. His
numerous sufferings, his long journeys, his ceaseless labours, have
reduced him to that state of bodily endurance. And glad and
thankful is he for humane attentions and ministries of Christian
love. In that sacred work Onesimus has been engaged. Found by
Paul,—and found, it may be, when the fugitive was in sickness,—
he was taken to the apostle's own abode, and there cared for in
mind as well as in body, until he came to possess both the ability
and the will to make a return in kind to his apostolic benefactor.
The reciprocation of kind offices begat mutual attachment. 
Learning to love the preacher, Onesimus learned also to love and to
espouse his doctrine. Now, therefore, is he a Christian,—a member
of Christ's spiritual body, and a sharer with Paul himself in
“the liberty wherewith Christ hath made him free.“ (Gal. v. 1.)
So intimate do the two friends become, that the elder regards the
younger as his “son,” while the younger, loving and respecting
the elder as his father, is as ready to obey as he is glad to serve
him. But mark, as they sit there in that humble apartment,
earnestly conversing with each other, mark the cloud that has
fallen on the countenance of Onesimus. It is heavy and deep.
In a moment it has disappeared. “You must return to Philemon.”
These are the words which darkened that face. “Return into
chains? horrible.” Shortly afterwards Onesimus is on the road.</p>
            <p>They are great changes with which we have to do in this
group of events. At the time of the publication of the Gospel,
<pb id="beard45" n="45"/>
slavery was universal. Philemon, a prominent and zealous 
member of the church at Colossæ, held a slave by name Onesimus. 
Having served his master badly, Onesimus ran away. But now 
of his own free will he is going back into bondage. This is the first 
great change. Ah, how many a footstep must he set between 
Rome and Colossæ, and for every footstep there was an act of 
the will. Every act of the will said, “return to servitude.” 
Yet the will never faltered, and the slave's own feet brought him 
into the house of Philemon. But what reception might he meet 
with there? There would be the jeers and jibes of fellow slaves
to endure. There were past neglects and misdeeds to atone for. 
There was an injured and an offended master to encounter. 
Nevertheless, of his own accord, Onesimus returns. At the first 
appearance, this would appear the height of folly. Masters held 
the power of life and death over their slaves. Onesimus had 
everything to fear. On what does he rely? Has be no 
safeguard? He has a few lines written by a poor <sic corr="decrepit">decrepid</sic> man 
hundreds of miles distant. Is that all? That is all. But it is 
enough; Onesimus knows that it is enough. What a 
wonder-working power is writing! We have read of charms, magical 
forms, and incantations; we have read of them, and of the powers 
they were said to possess. But even their fancied efficacy has in 
it nothing surpassing the efficacy of these few Greek characters 
written by Paul and borne by Onesimus. Guards, prisons, and 
chains—they are of less potency than words. Onesimus eluded 
the former, and goes back under the influence of the latter. 
These words, a token of the apostle's will, conduct Onesimus
back and protect him from the natural consequences of Philemon's 
wrath. Such is the sovereignty of thought. A morsel—
so to say—of Paul's mind, acts with supreme control beyond 
lands and seas.</p>
            <p>But the return indicates another great change. If, now, 
Onesimus sets his face towards the east, it is because his heart is 
changed. In a change of the affections, is found the cause of 
that change of his will. This is, indeed, a great change—a 
fugitive slave willingly goes back to bondage. There is no 
compulsion: there can be no compulsion. No spies, no catchpoles are
<pb id="beard46" n="46"/>
at work. No law in Rome compels the emperor to apprehend
and restore to the Colossians any of their slaves that might seek
shelter in the metropolis of the world. Though slavery then
prevailed throughout society, legislation had not reached the
height of wickedness which compels the freeman to be a 
police-officer to the slaveholder. In safety, and perhaps in prosperity,
might Onesimus have remained in Rome. But no! a power
stronger than the imperial power itself, sends him back. Go he
must, go he will, and go he does. Why? he must put that right
which he left wrong; he had injured his master, he must make
him compensation. And though in the matter of right, Onesimus
belonged to himself and not to Philemon, yet, as the law
recognised the institution of slavery, and every Christian ought to
avoid even the appearance of evil, so would Onesimus return to
Philemon in order to adjust their relations one with another.
Those relations had assumed a new aspect. The two persons who
had known each other only as master and slave, were now in
Christ “brothers beloved.” And as Christians, they recognised
a higher law than the world's—a law which rendered slavery
impossible, but which also commanded each to do unto others as 
he would be done unto. Relying on the former, and acting on
the latter, hoping to be set at liberty, yet believing it his duty to
give Philemon an opportunity of declaring his emancipation,
Onesimus has set his feet within his master's home. This, I
repeat, is indeed a great change. The fugitive is the returning
slave, because the slave has become a Christian. And the
Christian so highly values moral obligations, that in the thought
of his duties he almost forgets his rights, and at least is as regardful
of the legal claims of his master, as he is of his own natural
and indefeasible privileges.</p>
            <p>Onesimus, I have intimated, regarded the legal claims of Philemon.
There is no evidence that either Onesimus or Paul recognised
any other claim. It was the general practice of the first
disciples to pay obedience to the then existing civil laws.</p>
            <p>This respect for existing institutions, however, was merely
outward and temporary. Having its origin in prudential
consideration, it came to an end as soon as duty could safely supersede
<pb id="beard47" n="47"/>
expediency. Meanwhile, it implied at the bottom a disallowal 
of existing evils, and a determination to take the most effectual 
course for their abatement and removal. Tolerating slavery 
because it wished to take safe steps for rendering slavery 
impossible, it in reality hated the abomination of property in man's 
body and soul, and was ever silently at work to convert the slave 
into a man, and so to break the yoke and set the captive free. 
That this was the view under which Paul acted, is obvious from 
the language he employs in his Letter to Philemon:—</p>
            <p>In that Letter there is first the distinct assertion of a right. 
It is the right of Paul to claim the freedom of Onesimus. On 
what was that right founded? On Christ. Paul, Philemon, and 
Onesimus were in Christ partners, they were sharers of a common 
Gospel, such is the meaning of the term “partner,” employed by 
Paul in the 17th verse. As having, in common, “the redemption 
that was in Christ Jesus,” they were alike free. Onesimus, 
as a Christian, was as free as Philemon, and both were equally 
free with Paul. Onesimus, in consequence, had a claim to be 
pronounced free. And that claim Paul was at full liberty to 
urge on Philemon.</p>
            <p>I make this statement on the authority of the apostle's own 
words, as they are found in the 8th verse of the epistle; “though
I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is 
convenient.” This, the English version, very imperfectly 
represents the original. “Convenient,” is a most inadequate 
expression, at least in the sense in which it is now understood. 
Convenient with us signifies that which is easy and pleasant, rather 
than that which is obligatory; that which is suitable to the occasion, 
rather than conformable to the everlasting laws of right. 
The Greek word used by Paul, however, denotes that which is 
fit and proper, and in the third chapter of the Epistle to the 
Colossians, v. 18, it is rendered by the English term <hi rend="italics">fit.</hi> “Wives,
submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as <hi rend="italics">it is fit</hi>in the 
Lord.” That, in this injunction, the apostle spoke of duty, of 
Christian obligation, and not of any temporary expediency, is
clear from the corresponding passage in his Letter to the 
Ephesians, v. 22, where he says, “Wives, submit yourselves unto your
<pb id="beard48" n="48"/>
own husbands as unto the Lord.” It is, then, an obligation, a
Christian obligation, which Paul had the right to urge on Philemon. 
And this right he intimates he might freely urge. It was
a manifest right; a right about which there could be no dispute
between Christians; a right which the apostle was justified in
urging boldly, nay, very boldly; for thus, when exactly translated,
do his words run—“having much boldness in Christ, to enjoin
on thee that which is proper.” Observe the term “enjoin,”—it
is duties that are enjoined, not expediency. The act as described
in the Greek <figure id="ill4" entity="beard48"><p>[Greek text reading "(epsilon, pi, iota, tau, alpha, sigma, sigma, epsilon, iota, upsilon)."]</p></figure> is the act of a superior—of a general who
gives a command, of a governor who issues a decree. The 
imperial power of duty it was, which was in the writer's mind. As
an inspired expounder of Christian rights and duties, Paul
declares that he might, with full freedom of speech, require
Philemon to declare Onesimus free. But he would take a milder—
perhaps, for his purpose, a more effectual course; the assertion of
rights sometimes revolts the wrong-doer. Certainly it would be
more considerate, more kind, more Christian-like, to give Philemon 
the opportunity of doing what was right of his own accord, 
from his own sense of justice, from his own recognition of 
Christian principles; and therefore—to use Paul's own words—
“yet for loves sake I rather beseech thee,” (v, 9,) “for without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it 
were of necessity, but willingly.” (v. 14.) “No; do you by your 
own act pronounce his freedom, not as if constrained by duty 
enforced by me, but as prompted by Christian principle and
Christian love, abounding in your own heart.”</p>
            <p>Besides this unquestionable right which is not disallowed, but 
kindly thrown into the background, there is also in the Epistle 
the pleading of a claim grounded on the implication of a right. 
The claim is that of Onesimus who has a right to freedom. 
That claim and that right are now rather implied and intimated 
than declared. There is a sort of tacit appeal to principles 
recognised in common by the three persons concerned. 
Those principles are Christian principles. They are quietly put 
forth in the words, “Receive him for ever, not now as a servant,
<pb id="beard49" n="49"/>
but above a servant,—a brother beloved.” Observe here how 
adroitly Christian principles are insinuated. “Not now as a 
servant, but a brother.” The original is yet more forcible—“no 
longer as a servant.” No! no longer; the slave is a slave no 
more; in becoming a Christian, he has become a man; and your 
relation as well as his is changed; no more master as he is no 
more slave. So are both brothers. The same great fact is 
intimated in the words “for ever,” “that thou shouldest receive 
him for ever.” The bond which binds beloved brethren is not
liable to be disturbed by quarrels or broken by flight; it is 
durable, it is everlasting, it is as permanent as life, as long as 
eternity. And those who are linked together by spiritual bonds 
are not masters and slaves, but citizens of the commonwealth of 
God, and joint-heirs with the saints in light. A higher relation 
has come and dissolved the lower, as the sun melts the 
snow on the mountains; “above a slave, a brother.” And mark 
with what emphasis the apostle adds to this claim of brotherhood; 
“a brother beloved,” “beloved specially to me,” yea, “how much 
more unto thee?” What, this fugitive slave exceedingly loved by
his injured master? Yes, “both in the flesh and in the Lord;”—in
the flesh, because in the Lord, the slave loved because in 
becoming a Christian he had become a man, and because in 
his new relation, and in its moral consequences, Onesimus, slave 
by law as he still was, possessed the highest title to Philemon's
regard. Surely these are views which dissolve slavery as with 
the breath of the mouth of the Lord. And with views such as 
these, Paul doubtless had the firmest confidence that Philemon 
would set Onesimus free. Free indeed Onesimus was in the 
court of conscience with both Paul and Philemon. It only 
remained for the latter to pronounce him free. How then has it 
come to pass that advocates for slavery have ventured to plead 
the example of the apostle Paul, saying, “Did not Paul send
Onesimus back into slavery?” No! he sent him back to claim 
and to receive his freedom. It is true, however, that the apostle, 
like “a wise master builder,” was careful to avoid giving offence 
to Philemon, and did his best by gentle and soothing words to 
conciliate his favour. Slavery advocates have mistaken this
<pb id="beard50" n="50"/>
Christian consideration for the concession of a right. But
in the consideration the right is virtually denied, what
occasion for consideration was there if the right was admitted?
We are considerate of the feelings of others when we 
impeach their claims, not when we concede them. In truth,
Paul well knew that Philemon had the law on his side,
and though Paul had a confidence that Philemon would not
throw Onesimus back into chains, he could not be absolutely
sure that the Christian would prevail over the slave-master,
therefore he resolved to deal with the utmost delicacy with
Philemon. He must avoid giving him pain. He must avoid
arousing his prejudices. He must make the past calm, in order
that the present might be bright; consequently, he puts that as
an act of kindness on the part of Philemon which he might have
required of him as a duty. “Onesimus,” he in effect says,
“Onesimus is free, for he is a Christian man; Onesimus is free,
for he is beyond your reach, and desirous am I to retain his 
services, for of value are they to me; but without your mind I
would do nothing; let his emancipation be your own good act:
better were it so than that of necessity you should be 
compelled to forego his labour. I send him to you, therefore, in
order that as a Christian you may perform your duty, and that
as a man you may have the credit of declaring a fellow-man no
longer a slave. Over past injuries throw the veil of Christian
love. If you hesitate to forgive them, set them down to my
account. I will assume the obligation. You are, you know,
deeply in my debt, for your religion you owe to me; nay, your
very self; what you are I have made you. Well, then, draw up
a statement of debtor and creditor,—on the one side put what
you owe me, on the other, put what Onesimus owes you. The
totals shall balance each other, though your obligations are
far greater than mine. And that the rather, because as being
my son in Christ, you are bound to do more than repay me; you
are bound to give me joy of you in the Lord, to let me have the
pleasure of witnessing how Christian principles prevail in your
life,—but I say no more, I need say no more. Having confidence 
in thy obedience, I have written unto thee, knowing also
<pb id="beard51" n="51"/>
that thou wilt do more than I say.” (21.) Yes, there is the 
ground on which Paul acted. He had confidence that Philemon 
would obey his injunction,—an injunction all the more 
imperative on a good man and a brother, because rather 
intimated than obtruded, and because surrounded with all the 
courtesy of that Christian charity which thinketh no evil, and 
hopeth all things. Whether duty was regarded by Philemon in 
its bare and severe aspect, or in the claims of brotherly love, or 
in the claims of that special love and gratitude which Philemon 
owed to Paul, alike in each case, and by the united force of all, 
Philemon, Paul was assured, would feel himself under the most 
sacred obligations to perform a formal act of emancipation on 
behalf of Onesimus.</p>
            <p>Send Onesimus back into slavery? Paul sent him back into 
the warm embrace of a brother's love. He had confidence in 
that brother, because he was a brother. He believed that that 
brother would do even more than Christian duty required. Yes, 
he was of opinion that Philemon would not only emancipate 
Onesimus, but treat him as “a brother beloved.” The example of 
Paul and Philemon? O yes! would that it were followed. Plead 
it, ye advocates of slavery; plead it, and do more than plead it, 
make it the model of your own conduct. To what is it that ye 
send back the slave? Not to a loving brother, but to a hard
taskmaster; not to a happy home, but a dungeon and stripes; 
not to Christian freedom, but to heathen bondage and brutish 
toil, licentiousness, and degradation.</p>
            <p>The epistle of Paul to Philemon, then, is a plea on behalf
of emancipation, on behalf of human rights, on behalf of
Christian, and as Christian, so civil and personal freedom. The
gospel unbars prison doors, and strikes off the slave's chains.
“The spirit of the Lord,” swells the frame and bursts the bonds,
as with Samson, when he threw off the Philistine cords, “and
the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and the cords
that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire,
and his bands were melted from off his hands.” (Judg, xv. 14.)
With true Christianity, bondage is incompatible; the two cannot
<pb id="beard52" n="52"/>
co-exist. The one destroys the other; the one displaces the
other as much and as effectually as the light disperses the darkness 
and occupies its place.</p>
            <p>If, then, the spirit of Christ is in our hearts, we are friends of
liberty,—liberty of all kinds, and for “all orders and degrees of
men;” liberty for the slave, liberty for the citizen, liberty for
wife, children, and domestic. O the glorious liberty of the sons
of God! O the divine citizenship of the kingdom of heaven! In
the great spiritual commonwealth of Christ is the communion of
saints instead of the interchange of injustice; the sweet harmonies 
of Christian love instead of the harsh wranglings of rival
claims; the gentle ministries of mutual aid, instead of arbitrary
requirements and grudging services. Oh! when shall that kingdom 
come? come everywhere?</p>
            <p>This question Toussaint asked himself. The latter end of
his life gives the reply of his heart. Satisfied by his religious
studies that slavery was incompatible with the Gospel, he
resolved to do what in him lay to annihilate slavery in his own
vicinity. But the work was too important to be rashly undertaken, 
and Paul's prudence, and the prudence of the primitive
church at large, taught him that patience and discretion were
virtuous as well as desirable. He would therefore wait his
opportunity. True, years passed away, and mature life threatened 
to wane. Yet, in so arduous and perilous a task, where
one failure was irretrievable ruin, even long delay was preferable
to precipitation.</p>

<pb id="beard53" n="53"/>
him, the premonitions of which he was too sagacious not to discern.
Hayti was prosperous. The masters daily grew more opulent on
the produce of their plantations. The war of American independence 
made Hayti into a great commercial entrepôt, and largely
augmented its wealth. Could the actual condition of the colony
have been maintained, its riches would have continued to increase
—and with its riches its voluptuousness. But already that very
wealth had sown the seeds of disorder. The larger planters
were too opulent and too powerful to be at peace with each other.
There existed a rivalry between the two chief cities—the Cape
and the Port-au-Prince. This rivalry was made more intense
when, in 1787, the Superior Council of the Cape was suppressed,
and its power transferred to the Council of Port-au-Prince, under
the general designation of “the Superior Council of St. Domingo.”
Dissensions ensued, in which the west and the south soon took
part. Appeal was made to France. The government listened,
but gave no remedy. Recourse was had to indirect influence.
Deputies were sent to Paris. Their activity called forth 
opposition on the part of the colonial proprietors who habitually
resided in that metropolis; and they, carried away by the fashion
of the hour, formed, for the furtherance of their views, a club
called the Club Massaic—from the name of the hotel where the
members assembled. Thus organized, they proceeded to 
withstand the deputies from Hayti—and specially strove to prevent
their obtaining a hearing before the States General. The 
progress of events, however, creating a common alarm, the club
united with the deputies in seeking the establishment of a Colonial 
Assembly. In this question, there was a new source of 
disagreement. What should be its constitution? Who should be
its members? How should its members be elected? These
debateable points occasioned long and disquieting discussions.
The north and the west came again into collision, and the
island was torn by discord. The great proprietors set the 
example of division and innovation. At no period could such an
example have been more unseasonable. Throughout Europe
there had spread and waxed strong a spirit of humanity, which
denounced slavery and sought its abolition. In England and in
<pb id="beard54" n="54"/>
France that generous spirit acquired immense social power. Then
those philanthropists who acquired for themselves perpetual fame
in proclaiming the rights of the slave, and procuring the abolition 
of the slave trade, Price, Priestly, Sharp, Clarkson, Wilberforce, 
began their generous and noble efforts. The society of “The
Friends of the Blacks” was formed, and the stronghold of slavery
was assailed in a manner which announced the certainty of its
downfall.</p>
            <p>Could the desire of these eminent men have prevailed, the 
contest would have been left exclusively to mental and moral
resources. But the fermentation of the public mind in France,
moved in its very depths by centuries of civil and ecclesiastical
misrule and profligacy, provoked an appeal to the most violent
of human passions and the most dreadful of human appliances.
The oath of the Tennis Court and the taking of the Bastile 
commenced the battle of liberty against despotism. The announcement 
of these events in Hayti produced the greatest agitation.
The existing discontents received fresh impulse. The planters
hailed the revolution as a precursor of the independence of the
colony. The officers of the government encouraged the dream
of a counter-revolution. The <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fre">petits blancs,</foreign></hi> intoxicated with 
enthusiastic sympathy, cheered and sustained the Parisian mobs,
and hoped to pursue a similar course in the island. While the
several classes of the whites were thus distracted, the mulattoes
experienced the general excitement the more because they were
watching their opportunity for self-liberation. As to the negroes,
they in general pursued their wonted round of toil apparently,
and for the most part really, indifferent to the social commotion.
Certainly, among the agitated parties, no one thought of their
emancipation. The factions were intent only on their several
interests. The colonists wanted at least an increase of their
power. The men of colour sought to raise themselves to an
equality with the colonists. If these selfish views required a
covering, the veil was found in the claim of sameness of privileges
for all free men. The black was too much despised to
be thought of by the colonial combatants.</p>
            <pb id="beard55" n="55"/>
            <p>The first marked effort was made by the mulattoes, and so the
first contest was a contest for the attainment of mulatto interests.
A deputation of men of colour was sent to Paris. Eager to 
promote the views of their caste, they presented six millions of
francs for the service of the state, and offered the fifth of their
property in mortgage of the national debt. They asked in
return that they should in all things be put on a footing of
equality with the whites, whom they alleged they equalled in
number, and with whom they partook all the territorial and
commercial wealth of the colony. The president of the Assembly
replied, that “No part of the French nation should in vain claim
rights at the hands of the representatives of the French people.”</p>
            <p>At the same time there took place in the Assembly a 
discussion respecting the servitude of the blacks. The entire
nation seemed to have made the question its own; and a 
distinguished member of the legislature uttered these bold and
disinterested words: “I am one of the greatest proprietors of
St. Domingo; but I declare to you, that were I to loose all I
possess there, I would make the sacrifice rather than disown the
principles which justice and humanity have consecrated; I declare
for both the admission into the administrative assemblies (of the
colony) of men of colour, and the liberation of the blacks.” This
famous declaration made by Lameth produced an immense effect;
it astounded the great planters, and filled them with distrust and
hatred against the men of colour. That adverse feeling 
manifested itself in the execution at the Cape of the mulatto Lacombe,
whose only crime was the affixing of his signature to a petition,
in which he claimed the rights of man. The mulattoes of Petit
Goave had addressed to the electoral assembly of the west of
Hayti a petition in which they humbly requested, not equality of
rights, but merely some improvements in their condition. Those
who had put their names to the entreaty were all apprehended,
and the person who drew it up, Ferrand de Baudière, though
reputed a just and wise man, and though he had been high in
office, was, with only the forms of a trial, hurried into the hands
of the executioner, in spite of the efforts made to save him by
<pb id="beard56" n="56"/>
the colonial government. While these and other displays of hope
on the one side and jealousy and fear on the other, were taking
place, a decree of the French Legislature (8th of March, 1790)
arrived in the colony, which, founded on broad principles of justice,
gave the men of colour the right to enter the colonial assemblies.
The Haytian representatives, just constituted under the orders of
Louis XVI., and assembled at Saint-Marc, with the title of
“General Assembly,” before they proceeded to any other business,
formally declared that all the whites would die rather than share
political rights with “a bastard and degenerate race.” Moreover, 
they proclaimed themselves the sole legal and legitimate
representatives of the colony, and disallowed the authority of the
Governor-General, whose power emanated from the French 
government, merely consenting to submit their decrees for the royal
sanction. By these and similar steps, the tendency of which was
to concentrate all power in the hands of a portion of the resident
planters, two authorities were set in operation, for the usurpations
of the General Assembly compelled the Governor and the Superior
Council of Port-au-Prince, in union with the Provincial Assembly
of the North, to take measures of self-defence, and to maintain
their position. A bitter contest ensued.</p>
            <p>During the progress of these collisions, a new element of 
confusion intervened. Vincent Ogé, a man of colour, son of a
wealthy butcher at the Cape, whom the mulattoes had sent to
Paris, as one of their deputies, landed at Cap François, October
17th, 1790, under the name of Poissac, with the title of 
lieutenant-colonel, and the order of the Lion, which he had 
purchased of the prince of Limbourg; and having visited his mother,
who lived in handsome style at Dondon, marched, in alliance
with Chavanne, a man of his own caste, at the head of two 
hundred men to La Grande Rivière, in the department of the north.
From the camp which he established there, he sent to the
president of the Assembly of that department the following
letter:—</p>

                    <p>“A prejudice too long maintained, is about to fall. I
am charged with a commission doubtless very honourable to 
myself. I require you to promulgate throughout the colony the
instructions of the National Assembly of the 8th of March,
which gives without distinction to all free citizens the right of
admission to all offices and functions. My pretensions are just,
and I hope you will pay due regard to them. I shall not call

which I obtained in favour of the American colonists, formerly
known under the injurious epithet of “men of mixed blood,” I
did not include in my claims the condition of the negroes who
live in servitude. You and our adversaries have misrepresented
my steps in order to bring me into discredit with honourable
men. No, no, gentlemen! we have put forth a claim only on 
behalf of a class of freemen, who, for two centuries, have been under
the yoke of oppression. We require the execution of the decree
of the 8th of March. We insist on its promulgation, and we
shall not cease to repeat to our friends that our adversaries are
unjust, and that they know not how to make their interests 
compatible with ours. Before employing my means, I make use of
mildness; but if, contrary to my expectation, you do not satisfy
my demand, I am not answerable for the disorder into which
my just vengeance may carry me.”</p>

            <p>Ogé was attacked by a force of six hundred men. The attack
he repelled. The colonists sent another body of fifteen hundred
men against him. Ogé was defeated and fled. He took refuge
in the Spanish territories. His surrender was demanded from
the Spanish authorities. Being delivered up, he was put on his
trial. That trial, famous in the annals of Hayti, lasted two
months. At last Ogé and his lieutenant, Chevanne, were 
condemned to be broken alive on the wheel, and their goods to be
<pb id="beard58" n="58"/>
confiscated to the king. The sentence was immediately put into
execution. Nevertheless the mulatto war was not brought to an
end. On the contrary, the desire of ascendancy and the thirst
for revenge became every day more and more intense.</p>
            <p>Informed of the revolutionary proceedings of the Assembly of
St. Marc, the authorities in the mother country declared what it
had done null and void, divested its members of their authority,
required a new election of deputies in their place, and sent two
regiments of the line to carry their ordinances into execution.
The mulattoes were enthusiastic with joy. The colonists 
repelled with indignation the thought of receiving men of colour
as co-legislators with themselves. New risings took place, new
conflicts ensued. The passions every day burned more fiercely,
and while the mulattoes cherished boundless hopes, the whites,
overflowing with indignation, put themselves in open revolt
against the mother country, denying its prerogatives, and
refusing the civic oath. In the midst of these thickening 
disorders, the planters resident in France were invited to return,
and assist in vindicating the civil independence of the island.
Then was it that the mulattoes appealed to the slaves. Terrible
was the result. The slaves awoke as if from an ominous dream.
Under one of their class, named Boukman, a man of Herculean
strength, who knew not what danger was, the negroes on the
night of August 21st, 1791, arose in the terrific power of brute
force. Gaining immediate success, they rapidly increased in
numbers, and grew hot with fury. They fell on the plantations,
slaughtered their proprietors, and destroyed the property. Such
progress did the insurrection make, that on the 26th, the third of
the habitations of the Northern Department were in ashes. In
a week from its commencement the storm had swept over the
whole plain of the north, from east to west, and from the mountains 
to the sea. Those rich houses, those superb factories were
in ruins. Conflagration raged everywhere. The mountains,
covered with smoke and burning fragments, borne upwards by
the wind, looked like volcanoes. The atmosphere, as if on fire,
resembled a furnace. Everywhere were seen signs of devastation
—demolished edifices, smouldering embers, scattered and
<pb id="beard59" n="59"/>
broken furniture, plate, and other precious articles overlooked by
the marauders; the soil running with blood, dead bodies heaped
the one on the other, mangled and mutilated, a prey to voracious
birds and beasts.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref8" n="8" rend="sc" target="note8">*</ref><note id="note8" n="8" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref8">* See Note B, at the end.</note> In proceedings so horrible, Toussaint could
take no part. Faithful to his owner, he, during a whole month,
protected the plantation, at the head of the negroes, whom he
greatly contributed to keep in obedience, and prevented the
insurgents from setting the fields of sugar-cane on fire. While
all the whites were flying for their lives, and hurrying to find a
shelter in the towns, Madame Bayou de Libertas, protected by
Toussaint, remained in her own abode. The superintendent
himself, who was in camp at Haut-du-Cap, not far from his
plantation, safely ventured near every day, in order to keep up
the vigilance of the slaves. His safety he owed to Toussaint,
who, with inexpressible joy, saw Bayou among the negroes at a
moment when a white skin insured instant death. Happy the
slave-owner who, in such a crisis, has in his gang one who,
like Toussaint, is a man and a Christian indeed. Having
exerted every power to protect his mistress, assist his master,
and defend the property, and seeing the insurrection becoming
constantly more formidable, exhausted also by fatigue, Toussaint
at length induced Madame de Bayou, whose life he knew was in
danger, to quit Breda, and proceed to the Cape. In the
absence of her husband he got the carriage ready, loaded it
with articles of value, placed his mistress therein, and confided
her to the care of his younger brother Paul. Nor was this
the only service rendered to the family by their noble slave.
One of the first uses which he made of the influence he acquired
was to enable them to emigrate. While every white man and
all he possessed were devoted to destruction, Bayou, with his
family and a rich cargo, left Hayti and settled in the United
States.</p>

              <p>Continued collision of the planters, the mulattoes, and the negroes—The planters
willing to receive English aid—The negroes espouse the cause of Louis
XVI.—Arrival of Commissioners from France—Negotiations—Resumption

            </argument>
            <p>THE direful efficiency with which the negroes had devastated
the country, indicated the presence among them of a skill
superior to any they could possess. That skill was supplied by
mulattoes, who organized the destroying bands and directed their
movements. The “bastard and degenerate” race thus struck a
deadly blow at their criminal parents.</p>
            <p>During the progress of these furious excesses, a new general
assembly of planters opened its sessions, under the title of
“Colonial Assembly.” Its first act was an act of rebellion.
Refusing to apply to France for aid, and having taken measures
of self-defence, it sought protection from England. These were
the terms it employed in a letter addressed to the governor of
Jamaica:—</p>

fallen on this beautiful island; fire lays waste our possessions,
the hands of our negroes in arms are already dyed with the blood

the wreck of our fortunes—already half-destroyed; and confined
within the towns, we look for your aid.”</p>

            <p>Without awaiting a reply, the General Assembly adopted the
round English hat as the uniform of its troops, and substituted
the black cockade for the French national colours.</p>
            <pb id="beard61" n="61"/>
            <p>The reply of the Governor, Lord Effingham, did not come
up to the expectations of the planters; he merely sent five
hundred muskets, with some ammunition, and commanded a
vessel of fifty guns to cruise off the western coast.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile the black insurgents, after augmenting their numbers 
by force as well as persuasion, placed themselves under
the standard of royalty; they gave themselves the name of
“The King's Own,” and their leader, Jean-François, assumed
the title of High-Admiral, while his second in command
became Generalissimo of the conquered territories. Summoned
to yield by Blanchelande, Governor of French Hayti, they
replied,—</p>
            <q direct="unspecified">“SIR,—We have never thought of failing in the duty and
respect which we owe to the representative of the person of
the King, nor even to any of his servants whatever; we have
proofs of the fact in our hands; but do you, who are a just man as
well as a general, pay us a visit; behold this land which we have
watered with our sweat—or rather, with our blood,—those 
edifices which we have raised, and that in the hope of a just reward!
Have we obtained it? The King—the whole world—has
bewailed our lot, and broken our chains; while, on our part, we,
humble victims, were ready for anything, not wishing to abandon 
our masters. What do we say? We are mistaken; those
who, next to God, should have proved our fathers, have been
tyrants, monsters unworthy of the fruits of our labours: and do
you, brave general, desire that as sheep we should throw 
ourselves into the jaws of the wolf? No! it is too late. God, who
fights for the innocent, is our guide; he will never abandon us.
Accordingly, this is our motto—<hi rend="italics">Death or Victory!</hi> In order to
prove to you, excellent sir, that we are not so cruel as you may
think, we, with all our souls, wish for peace,—but on condition
that all the whites, whether of the plain or of the mountains,
shall quit the Cape without a single exception; let them carry
with them their gold and their jewels, we seek only liberty,—
dear and precious object! This, general, is our profession of
faith; and this profession we will maintain to the last drop of
<pb id="beard62" n="62"/>
our blood. We do not lack powder and cannons. Therefore,
liberty or death! God grant that we may obtain freedom without 
the effusion of blood! Then all our desires will be accomplished; 
and believe it has cost our feelings very much to have
taken this course. Victory or death for freedom!”</q>
            <p>This assumption of the part of Louis XVI. astounded and
perplexed the planters. The fact, however, was only too plain.
By means of the Spaniards of Hayti, the counter-revolutionary
party in France gave secret support to the insurgents, if they
did not also call them forth: and in order to impart feasibility
and vigour to the movement, they gave out that the king's life
had been put in danger by the whites, because he had resolved
to emancipate the blacks. Strange reversals! While the
colonists hoisted English colours, their slaves exhibited the white
flag, with the words on one side <hi rend="italics">Long live the king;</hi> and, on the
other, <hi rend="italics">The ancient system of government.</hi></p>
            <p>The insurrection proceeded; the negroes carried their arms
from place to place, and subduing all the open country, reduced
the colonists to the defensive. As the contest went on, horrors
multiplied. The planters hung on trees and hedges the dead
bodies of their black prisoners; the insurgents formed around
their camp an enclosure, marked by the bleeding heads of those
who fell under their hands. The fury of the negroes was 
stimulated by unworthy priests; but even religion was powerless
when it endeavoured to place a barrier against tumultuous
passion. A priest was hung on the spot for the crime of
trying to protect innocent women from brutal violation.</p>
            <p>The superior discipline at the command of the colonists, 
however, began to prevail. The negroes were checked, and driven
back. Their bands were directed by three chiefs, Jean-François,
Biassou, and Jeannot.</p>
            <p>Jean-François belonged to a colonist of the name of Papillon.
A young creole of good exterior, he had not been able to bear
the yoke of slavery, though he had no special cause of complaint
against his master; he had, long before the revolution, obtained
his liberty. Flying from the plantation, he joined the maroons,
<pb id="beard63" n="63"/>
or black fugitives, who wandered at large in the refuge of the
mountains. He was naturally of a mild disposition, and inclined
to clemency. If his career was stained by cruelties, the crime
must be imputed to perfidious councils. Of no great courage,
and little enterprise, he owed his command to his intellectual
superiority.</p>
            <p>Biassou belonged to the religious body designated “The
Fathers of Charity.” A contrast, in every respect, to 
Jean-François, he was fiery, rash, wrathful, and vindictive. Always
in action, always on horseback, very suspicious, and very aspiring,
he usurped the lead which the apathy of his principal almost
let fall into his hands. Jean François loved luxury, fine clothes,
and grand equipages; Biassou was given to women and drink.</p>
            <p>Jeannot, a slave of the plantation of M. Bullet, was small
and slender in person, and of boundless activity. Perfidious of
soul, his aspect was frightful and revolting. Capable of the greatest 
crimes, he was inaccessible to regret and remorse. Having
sworn implacable hatred against the whites, he thrilled with rage
when he saw them; and his greatest pleasure was to bathe his
hands in their blood. On his master's estate, the chief theatre
of his crimes, he was sure, after committing a massacre, to gather
up in his hands the blood which flowed on all sides, and carrying
it to his mouth, was heard to exclaim—“Oh, my friends, how
sweet—how good—this white blood! let us take full draughts;
let us swear irreconcilable revenge against our oppressors; peace
with them, never—so help me God!” Like cruel men in general,
Jeannot was as cowardly as he was faithless. Yet was he
daring in attack; and when danger pressed, his fear or his fury
drove his troops to a resistance proof against attack, or compelled
them to snatch a victory by cutting off every way of retreat.</p>
            <p>Such were the men under whom Toussaint now found himself.
No longer able to choose the moment for commencing his 
benevolent enterprise, he was hurried into the eddying torrent by the
swelling streams of popular fanaticism. His fidelity to his 
proprietors making him an object of suspicion and a butt for negro
attack, he was, even in self-defence, obliged to fall into the ranks
of the raging insurgents. Generally known as much for his
<pb id="beard64" n="64"/>
intelligence as his moderation, he was the less likely to be spared;
but dragged into the rebellion against his better feelings and his
judgment, he was regarded with distrust. Withheld, in 
consequence, from the military post for which his talents fitted him,
he was commanded to employ his medical skill in taking care of
the wounded. Quietly and usefully employed in an office which
was agreeable to his feelings, he, at a distance from the conflict,
turned his naturally reflective mind to the study of the personal
qualities of his chiefs, and so acquired an acquaintance with their
weaknesses, which greatly aided him in at length attaining
supreme command. That post he reached without disgracing
himself by blood or pillage, in a contest in which examples of
both crowded on his sight. He was by nature retiring and
given to seclusion, but in François Lafitte, whom he had long
known, and whom he now found among the insurgents, he had
one companion with whom similarity of ideas and feelings made
intercourse both pleasant and profitable. It may well be 
supposed that these two men, united in the bonds of goodness and
philanthropy, often deplored together the horrible excesses which
they witnessed or of which they heard.</p>
            <p>As, however, the insurrection passed on—and specially when
defeat made its conduct difficult, the leaders found it imperative
to bring forward all men of superior talent. No longer, therefore, 
was Toussaint permitted to pursue his medical occupations.
Taken out of comparative privacy, he was made aide-de-camp
to Biassou.</p>
            <p>A grotesque spectacle did that negro army, or rather those
negro bands, present. The slaves were ridiculously attired in the
spoils of their masters. The cavalry were mounted on lumbering
horses and mules, worn down by labour and fatigue. The horseman 
was armed with a musket almost as dangerous to himself
as to his foe. The infantry were all but naked, and destitute of
experience; their weapons were sticks pointed with iron, broken
or blunted swords, pieces of iron hoop, and some wretched guns
and pistols. Notwithstanding the alarm they inspired, the troops
were almost without ammunition. Jean François, decorated
with ribbons and orders which he had plundered in the sack of
<pb id="beard65" n="65"/>
the abodes of the proprietors, gave himself out for a chevalier of
the order of Saint Louis, besides taking to himself the titles of
admiral and generalissimo. Biassou and Jeannot were brigadiers,
a title which was fixed on Toussaint: the rest were marshals,
commanders, generals, colonels, and some condescended to be
captains. At a later period, Biassou, on having a disagreement
with Jean François, assumed the pompous title of viceroy of the
conquered countries. Only an iron discipline could maintain
any order in such a body of men. The soldiers had sought
liberty, and for the moment found the severest bondage. 
Disobedience was punished with severity, in the more flagrant
instances with decapitation. Yet some regard was shown to the
rights of property, for the stealer of cattle was hanged.</p>
            <p>The leaders of the insurrection feared each other. Jeannot's
cruelties were held in abomination by Toussaint. Jean François, 
by whom Jeannot was dreaded, resolved to disembarrass
himself of the monster. Seizing his opportunity, he caused him
to be apprehended. Tried by a summary process, Jeannot was
sentenced to be shot. In this moment of peril, the wretch who
had shed so much blood, and who had gloated over the sufferings
of his victims, proved how cowardly a soul he had. He threw
himself on his knees before Jean François, supplicated pardon,
offered to purchase life by becoming his slave; and when the
priest came up to offer him spiritual aid, he took him into his
arms, pressing body to body, and was only by violence torn from
him, to be dragged to execution.</p>
            <p>The whites, although they had gained advantages in the war,
were scarcely less than the blacks agitated with mutual dissensions. 
While they lost time and energy in discord, the men of
colour assumed a formidable position under one of their caste,
named Beauvais. The movement had an excuse in the cruelties
which the colonists perpetrated at the Cape, where seventeen
mulattoes had been put to death without even the forms of a trial,
and where daily fugitive slaves, even the most faithful, were, on
seeking an asylum in the city, forthwith hanged, after having
escaped the dangers of being massacred on their road by some of
the white scouts who scoured the neighbourhood.</p>
            <pb id="beard66" n="66"/>
            <p>On every side the grossest injustice prevailed; crime was 
repaid with crime; vengeance followed vengeance; the civilised
master degraded himself no less than the neglected slave;
between the two stood the mulatto, the enemy of both, and 
prepared to sacrifice either for his own aggrandisement.</p>
            <p>The ease with which the mulatto betrayed the rights of the
negro may be exemplified in the case of a number of men 
denominated<hi rend="italics"> the Swiss.</hi> In the ranks of the men of colour were
three hundred slaves, who received the title of “the Swiss,” from
the resemblance which their service bore to that of the Swiss
under the French monarchy. Used by the men of colour in
their warfare against the whites, they were surrendered by the
former at the demand of the latter the moment fortune began to
frown on the mulatto cause. Consisting of men of colour as well
as negroes, they were thrown on the coast of Jamaica. Driven
thence, they either perished in the ocean or on the inhospitable
shores of their birth, presenting in their sufferings and destruction 
a proof of the inhumanity of the whites and the perfidy of
the mulattoes.</p>
            <p>Disorder continued to increase. It would be a tedious as
well as painful task to recount the misdeeds that were done on
all sides, at the Cape by the colonists, at La Grande Rivière by
the negroes, and in the west by the mulattoes. The leaders of
the blacks began to feel that they had in hand a hopeless cause.
The liberation of the negro population was not possible in the
presence of two powerful enemies, the planters and their descendants. 
Consequently they were not disinclined to negotiate.</p>
            <p>At this juncture, there arrived in Hayti, three commissioners,
sent by the mother country on a mission of peace. These were
Roume, Mirbeck, and St. Léger. Roume, a creole of Grenada, had
been a councillor in that island, and afterwards a commissioner
at Tobago. Under a simple and modest exterior, he possessed
much knowledge; of a phlegmatic disposition, he would have
been inaccessible to the attacks of the factions, had not his
ordinary fickleness called forth their efforts. Mirbeck, a 
celebrated advocate in the council of state, where he had pleaded
many causes for the colonists, was haughty and inflexible. St.
<pb id="beard67" n="67"/>
Léger, had long lived as a physician in Tobago, where he 
possessed slaves. The first object of these three men, was to
appease the civil war which wasted the west, and to stop the
hurricane which covered the north with ruins. They wisely
began by causing the gallows of the planters at the Cape to be
demolished. The news of their arrival induced the masters of
the slaves to open a negotiation. Raynal and Duplessy, the
first a free mulatto, the second a free negro, being admitted to
an audience by the Colonial Assembly, received for answer the
following:—“Emissaries of the revolted negroes, the assembly
established on the law and by the law, cannot correspond with
people armed against the law—against all laws: the assembly
might extend grace to guilty men if, being repentant, they had
returned to their duty. Nothing would please its members
better than to be in a condition to recognise those who, contrary
to their will, have been hurried into guilt. We know how to
measure out favours as well as justice. Withdraw!” “Withdraw” 
to men who came with the olive-branch in their hands!
The deputies did withdraw—indignation burning in their hearts,
and curses murmured from their lips. They made their way
through the spectators with a haughty brow, and when that
crowd tried to hoot them down, they hastened to register a new
outrage in the book of vengeance.</p>
            <p>On the arrival of the deputies at La Grande Rivière, the army
of the population came together. Every one had fondly dreamt
of union. What was the disappointment! When Raynal and
Duplessy related the disdainful manner in which they had been
treated, cries of vexation and rage rent the air. Biassou, unable
to restrain his passion, ordered all the whites detained in the
camp, to be put to death. The necessary preparations were
made; when Toussaint—always humane—intervened, calmed
his chief, and saved the lives of the intended victims. Such is
the ascendancy of goodness. Such is the power of that rapid,
animated, and picturesque eloquence which Toussaint possessed,
and which, on very many other occasions, he employed for 
merciful results of a similar kind. We subjoin an instance. Biassou
one day received from the Cape a proclamation intended to win
<pb id="beard68" n="68"/>
back the slaves. The insurgent chief determined to publish it.
Causing his soldiers to take their arms, he ordered the 
proclamation to be read aloud. Instantly there arose the awful cry of
“Death to the whites.” Toussaint shuddered, rushed forward,
again read the proclamation, with a commentary of his own.
The result was, that the desire for vengeance sank in those rude
breasts, tears stole down their cheeks, and the prisoners were
saved. Such a conquest is one of the highest achievements
of humanity. A conference took place. There were present,
the commissioners, and Bullet, a representative of the Colonial
Assembly. Jean François, leaving Biassou at La Grande Rivière,
hastened to La Petite Anse, in the vicinity of the Cape, to take
part in the conference. He was followed by a considerable troop
of cavalry. Full of confidence in the representatives of the king,
he proceeded to alight from his horse, when Bullet, seizing the
bridle, struck him with his riding-whip. Jean François might
have taken instant revenge; he simply withdrew to his soldiers.
Who was the greater? St. Léger saw the evil effects this brutal
act might occasion, and, unattended, advanced towards Jean
François. This act of confidence restored a friendly feeling. A
peaceful arrangement was entered into, involving the emancipation 
of fifty persons, an exchange of prisoners, and the return of
the slaves to their labours. Jean François required the liberation 
of his wife, who lay in the prisons of the Cape. There is no
reason to believe that the request was complied with. But the
insurgent, faithful to his word, the next day dismissed his 
prisoners, employing in the benevolent office the mild Toussaint,
and his equally mild friend, Lafitte.</p>
            <p>Peace seemed at hand. Alas! it was very distant. The
colonists, displeased with the pacific tendencies of the 
commissioners, endeavoured to set aside their powers, and required
their obedience. The mulattoes suffered disadvantages, but
could not be put down. The negroes resumed their devastations.
On every side was disorder, slaughter, and ruin. The pride and
obstinacy of the planters rendered accommodation impossible;
their weakness exposed the colony to carnage the most frightful,
and depredations the most extensive. Meanwhile, Jean François
<pb id="beard69" n="69"/>
and Biassou were each too powerful and too ambitious to act
cordially together. They came to an open quarrel, and drew off
their several forces into two camps. Toussaint, now the 
principal aide-de-camp of Biassou, brought on himself the enmity of
his rival, Jean François, though hitherto he had succeeded in
keeping on good terms with both. The hostile feeling seems to
have been called forth by Toussaint's intellectual preeminence.
However, Toussaint, disregarding the dissensions of the generals,
quietly and efficiently discharged his duties, and gradually gaining
the esteem of the army, laid the foundations of the great 
influence which he was one day to exert on behalf of negro 
independence. He alone wept when he saw the hope of peace vanish.
<sic corr="He">e</sic> alone remained unsullied by crime, while Jean François and
Biassou not only committed ravages and massacre, but even
sold into slavery to the Spaniards many of the very men for
whose liberty they pretended to be fighting, and who were their
companions in arms.</p>

            <p>SUCH was the condition of affairs when there was brought to
Hayti a decree of the Legislative Assembly which, among other
things, declared that the men of colour and free negroes should be
admitted to vote in all the parochial assemblies to be convened
in order to elect a new general assembly and municipal corporations. 
The decree was supported by commissioners, of whom
Sonthonax was at the head. It was, however, impossible to <sic corr="give">givs</sic>
it immediate effect. The contest proceeded. The mulattoes
<pb id="beard70" n="70"/>
overcome, joined the colonists against the blacks. The blacks
defeated, took shelter in the mountains, and constantly renewed
their predatory warfare. A fresh cause of complication added to
the troubles of the island; Louis XVI. had been beheaded. Then
the slaves gave up all thought of peace. Naturally inclined to
a monarchy, they renounced the revolutionary government,
and passed over into the service of Charles IV., king of Spain.
Jean François received the title of Lieutenant-General in that
monarch's army; Biassou became one of his brigadiers; and
Toussaint was honoured with the same mark of confidence. A
medal, bearing the effigy of Charles, was decreed to them. Under
this powerful protection, the insurgents became more formidable
than ever.</p>
            <p>France, in the midst of her own troubles, did not cease to cast
an eye, from time to time, on her distracted colony. She dispatched
General Galbaud to take the command in Hayti. Disembarking
at the Cape, (May 6, <sic corr="1793)">1793,)</sic> he proceeded to assume the executive
power. But the French commission already in the island,
triumphant in the west and in the south, had everywhere 
established mulatto in place of white commanders. Returning on
the 7th of June to the Cape with a detachment of freed men,
commanded by Chanlatte, the commissioners directed Galbaud
to re-embark. Unwillingly he obeyed. His brother, a man of
ability, remained in the city, and agitated the minds of the
people against the commissioners. The vessels in the harbour
were loaded with prisoners sent thither by the Government.
Breaking their chains, they, to the number of one thousand two
hundred, effected a landing. Their bands increasing as they
proceeded, they directed their course to the Government house,
inhabited by the commissioners. The approaches to it were
defended by men of colour. The National Guards and mounted
volunteers joined the <sic corr="partisans">partizans</sic> of Galbaud. The troops of the
line remained in their quarters, not knowing, in the strife of
authorities, which was legitimate. Fighting took place in the
streets, the fury of which was stopped only by night. The next
day hostilities were resumed. At length the troops of the line
declared for the commissioners. Nevertheless, their party seemed
<pb id="beard71" n="71"/>
to lose ground. Then the prisons were thrown open, and the
chains of the blacks were broken. Spreading themselves abroad,
these captives showed themselves worthy of the liberty they had
just received. Pierrot and Macaya, two black chiefs of the 
insurgent negroes on the hills of the Cape, being invited, came
with their fierce associates to take part in the carnage. Galbaud
was defeated. With a few of his followers he regained his ships.
His brother remained in the hands of the commissioners. He
himself, with more than ten thousand refugees of all hues, set
sail for the United States. The city, “the Paris of the Antilles,”
as the colonist enthusiastically termed Cape Town, was in flames,
and on every side presented the shocking tokens of pillage,
slaughter, and conflagration. Truly did the flames of the French
revolution set on fire the world. The strifes of political 
<sic corr="partisanship">partizanship</sic> which raged in Paris, were transplanted to Hayti,
where they raged with all the heat of a tropical climate and all
the animosity of a civil war. As if to aid in wearing down the
forces of the planters, white men, who should have healed
grievances and restored tranquillity, came from the mother
country only to call forth new enmities, and add new brands to
the burning. These collisions among men of white blood, went far
to remove and destroy the veil of <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">préstige</hi></foreign> and fear with which,
under centuries of domination, they were regarded by the blacks.
It was now found that the planters were no more than men;
very ordinary men; men of low passions; intensely selfish men;
men who fell beneath the black man's sword; nay, men who
could not keep their hands from each other; men who themselves
destroyed the property which the negroes produced. These
were pregnant and dangerous lessons. Yes, the blacks are on
the road to freedom, and the whites are their guides and helpers.</p>
            <p>The commission retired from the burning city into the 
neighbouring highlands, where a camp was formed to protect the
Cape from the irruption of the insurgents. Having no longer
any confidence in the whites, all of whom they suspected of 
anti-revolutionary sympathies, and seeking new defenders of the
cause of republicanism, they, on the 22nd of June, proclaimed
the freedom of all slaves who should enrol themselves for the
<pb id="beard72" n="72"/>
sacred cause of the republic. Pierrot, who commanded for
Biassou, at Port François, not far from the Cape, was the first
to respond to the proclamation; he, with his band, came to
place himself at the disposal of the commission.</p>
            <p>While yet the conflagration was not extinguished, pestilence
and famine fell on the miserable inhabitants of Cape Town. A
yet more dreadful enemy impended. The ferocity and ravages
of the blacks alarmed the commissioners themselves. Perplexed
as to the means of staying the fury of these dangerous allies, they
put forth a proclamation, in which they said, “That those who
had recently been set free could not be good citizens unless they
were closely bound to their country by the touching ties of
husband and father, and that, consequently, they were each 
invested with the right of bestowing liberty on their wives and
their children.” Admirable resolution! But has it come soon
enough? Why will men delay justice until justice itself is of
little or no avail? The blacks, degraded by life-long bondage,
saw in these words only a recognition of their entire freedom;
in other terms, only an authority to do what they pleased. But
a small number of them responded to these efforts for their
social improvement. The blame lay chiefly with white men,
who caballed and plotted among the blacks in order to make
them effective in maintaining the cause of royalty. Thus did
the black chiefs, Jean François and Biassou, reply to the offer of
the commission:—“We cannot conform to the will of the nation,
because, from the beginning of the world, we have executed only
the will of a king: we have lost the king of France, but we are
esteemed by the king of Spain, who bestows on us rewards, and
ceases not to give us succour; consequently we are unable to
acknowledge you, the commissioners, before you have found a
king.” To this declaration of their intentions the negroes
remained true. The expedient had failed. Hostilities became
more bitter than ever.</p>
            <p>In this refusal of the privileges tendered by the republican
commissioners, Toussaint took his share of responsibility.
Doubtless he partook of the monarchical prepossessions of his
<pb id="beard73" n="73"/>
associates. Royalty he considered as the sole sufficient pledge
of liberty. He both feared and distrusted republicans, of
whose excesses in Europe he had read so much. He may
have regarded the tardy concession of freedom as a subterfuge,
and not unreasonably may he have suspected the danger that
the negroes would be sacrificed in the collisions of the white
factions. Uncertain too, was it, whether the commissioners
would be able to maintain themselves in power, and should the
planters gain the upper hand, they would easily deal with their
slaves, then no longer enrolled and under discipline, but scattered
over the land, indulging in the intoxication of recent freedom.
Besides, he had taken a part; he was a soldier of the king of Spain,
and had more to hope for from his interest in that quarter, than
could be gained by rushing into the arms of the feeble 
commissioners.</p>
            <p>Toussaint had already made his apprenticeship in warfare.
With his superior knowledge and ability, and with his resolute
yet silent will, he had readily fought his way into a foremost position, 
and won both confidence and distinction. The insurgents
held strong places in the mountains which rise to the south of
the Cape, in the neighbourhood of La Grande Riviére, Dondon,
Marmelade, &amp;c. Thither the commissioners directed their 
hostilities. The whole district was subject to the insurrection,
except Marmelade. Thither Brandicourt, the government's
commander, determined to retire. But there was in his councils
a traitor, Pacot, who was in correspondence with the enemy.
Under his influence it had been resolved that the retreat should
take place during the day-time. Informed of the arrangement,
Toussaint laid his ambuscades. Next morning, the army began
its march. Planel, lieutenant of grenadiers, commanded the
advanced guard. As he proceeded he was encountered with
the cry, “Who goes there?” “ France,” was his reply. “Then
let your general come and speak to ours—no harm shall <sic corr="befall">befal</sic>
him,” answered one of Toussaint's officers, who, with a company
of men, was posted there. Brandicourt, who was in the centre
of his forces, on learning the confusion that had arisen, hastened
<pb id="beard74" n="74"/>
to the spot, leaving the command to Pacot. Having 
reconnoitred the enemy, he ordered an attack. Forthwith, he was on
all sides entreated to have an interview with Toussaint, whose
humanity, it was urged, was well known. Besides, he had left
behind a hundred invalids—how much better to recommend
them to Toussaint's care. Brandicourt yielded to the representations, 
went forward, and was immediately seized. He and his
officers were disarmed, bound and conducted to Toussaint's camp.
The blacks are beginning to show that under an able leader they
know how to make themselves respected. But the French
general's soldiers yet stood in their ranks, armed, and ready for
battle. “Write,” said Toussaint to Brandicourt, “and 
command your forces to yield.” Taking the pen, Brandicourt in
tears wrote that, being a prisoner, he left Pacot to follow the
course which prudence might seem to dictate. “No,” added
Toussaint, tearing the paper, “I must have from you an express
order to Pacot, to lay down his arms.” The order was sent.
On receiving it, Pacot read the command to his officers, and
added, “Do what you like; for myself, I surrender.” The
column yielded without delay. Brandicourt, being sent to Porto
Rico, died there of grief and vexation. Yes, here is the man,
and the hour is coming.</p>
            <p>It is with difficulty that I bring myself to the utterance of
commendation on merely warlike deeds. Having a deep aversion 
to war, I shrink from any approach to a eulogy of anything
connected therewith. But if war is ever respectable, it is surely
when it is employed as a means of liberating thousands of
oppressed men from hopeless bondage. In the hands of 
Toussaint, arms were the instruments of freedom; the only 
instruments that could have been made use of. Nor was it an 
unimportant lesson which he had to teach, and did well teach, in
proving to white men and to the world, that negro blood did not
exclude its possessors from the highest renown which can attend
military skill and achievements. In the victory which 
Toussaint had so easily gained over a French general of no mean
repute, there appears great ability in military combinations, as
well as extraordinary promptitude and determination. These
<pb id="beard75" n="75"/>
are qualities which make a great soldier, and these qualities
were in an eminent degree possessed by Toussaint.</p>
            <p>By this achievement Dondon fell into the hands of the
insurgents. Dondon was the centre of the country. Possessed of
it, Toussaint had almost a free passage into the western department, 
while already the negro forces were triumphant in the north.</p>
            <p>At this position of affairs, the commissioners at the Cape
not unnaturally grew alarmed. Revolving the means at
their disposal, they determined to celebrate the fourth 
anniversary of the capture of the Bastille, in order to revive the
republican enthusiasm, and thereby gain power for renewed
efforts against the insurgents.</p>
            <p>Is the reader struck with the inconsistency of their conduct?
Yes, these friends of liberty are seeking arms against liberty.
Believing that the fall of the Bastille was the fall of tyranny in
France, they deliberately turn the event to account in order to
buttress up oppression in Hayti. Republicans ye may be, lovers
of freedom ye are not, any more than those, your brothers and
descendants, who recently put down liberty in Rome with 
republican bayonets, and under republican colours. Hypocrisy
was added to inconsistency; the qualities are not unlike. Amid
the festivities which were designed to aid in the subjugation of
the revolted negroes, these words were spoken by the commissioner 
Polverel: “The oppressed were Africans whom kings and
their satellites sent to purchase, at their own hearths, of kings
who had not the right to sell them into perpetual slavery in
America. The oppressed were descendants of the Africans who,
even when they had recovered their liberty, were accounted 
unworthy of the rights of man. The oppressors are all the kings
who traffic in the life and liberty of men of all countries and all
colours. The oppressors are all the traitors and brigands who
wish to restore royalty and slavery.”</p>
            <p>This effusion of indignation against “kings and their satellites” 
lacked one word. If “republicans” had been added, the
description would have been more correct. The statement is
illustrated by the fact that Sonthonax, another of the commissioners, 
in a speech delivered on the occasion, characterised the
<pb id="beard76" n="76"/>
insurgents as “a mass of vagabonds and idlers who will neither
cultivate the land nor defend the cultivators,” and whom it was
a primary duty to reduce and compel to resume their toils.</p>
            <p>The treacherous favours offered to the blacks by the commission, 
had offended and alienated the skin aristocracy. At the town
of Jéremie, in the extreme north-west of the southern department, 
the planters had even formed an encampment hostile to
the civil authority. They had, moreover, driven from the towns
of the district the men of colour who had taken refuge in Les
Cayes on the southern side of the same tongue of land. 
Sonthonax having proclaimed liberty for all the slaves, sent Andrew
Rigaud to carry his orders into execution, and to restore the
mulattoes to their homes. Advancing from Petit Trou, (June
l7th,) on reaching the plantation of Desrivaux, near Jéremie,
Rigaud found himself stopped by an entrenchment defended by
five hundred men and five pieces of cannon. Consulting only
his ardour and the object of his mission, he hastened to attack
the fortification. At the head of three columns he three times
mounted to the assault; three times was he driven back.
After fighting for four hours and losing several brave officers, he
retreated, and at the head of fifty men protected himself in the
midst of the greatest perils. Retiring to Petit Trou he received
reinforcements and enrolled slaves. The last act made him a
special object of hatred to the planters, who, disregarding the
means, resolved to effect his destruction. Having crossed the
country to Les Cayes, he took part in a repetition of the festivities 
which had been celebrated at the Cape. Whites, blacks, and
mulattoes exchanged tokens of friendship and manifested a 
common joy. In the midst of scenes which promised lasting amity,
he was fallen upon by Bandollet, commander of the white
National Guard, and barely escaped through a shower of bullets,
by extraordinary courage and activity. This disgraceful attempt
at assassination excited general abhorrence, and added impulse
and vigour to the negro cause.</p>
            <p>Rigaud, who, next to Toussaint, was destined to play the chief
part in this internecine conflict, was a mulatto in the true sense
of the term; he was, that is to say, the son of a white man and
<pb id="beard77" n="77"/>
a black woman. Educated at Bordeaux, where he had gone
through a pretty good course of instruction, and learned the trade
of a goldsmith, and having served in Savannah and Guadeloupe,
he entered the militia in Les Cayes, his native place. While
pursuing his business, which colonial prejudices regarded as too
good for a mulatto, he was called into active service by the 
insurrection. Rigaud had in his soul the elements of a great man.
In Hindostan he would have founded an empire. In Hayti he
scarcely rose above a banditti chief; yet did he know how to
make himself formidable. Of a martial aspect, his countenance
was terrible in combat; yet after the excitement was over, it was
mild and engaging. In the progress of the war of liberation he
raised, organized, and commanded a legion, called “The Southern 
Legion of Equality,” which proved the finest and the most
effective of the troops formed in Hayti. Aware, in his own 
experience, of the value of knowledge, he took pains to have his
soldiers instructed. “If”—to cite the words of a native of
Hayti—“if in the south of the isle the traveller meets even now
(1850) with aged Africans who possess the elements of classical
instruction, he may salute them; they are Rigaud's legionaries.
Admirable for good sense, they have a lofty spirit, above the 
prejudices of colour; with them, the white man, the mulatto, and
the black man are sons of the same father. I thank Heaven that
the epoch of my visit to the district allowed me to shake hands
with these relies of the glory of my country, those old negroes
whose excellence of heart and aptitude of mien Europe is 
ignorant of, and whose descendants lie under the obligation of 
justifying the hopes of the friends of equality.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref9" n="9" rend="sc" target="note9">*</ref></p>

            <argument>
              <p>Toussaint becomes master of a central post—Is not seduced by offers of negro
emancipation, nor of bribes to himself—Repels the English, who invade the
island; adds L'Ouverture to his name, abandons the Spaniards, and seeks
freedom through French alliance.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>AFTER the conquest of Dondon, Toussaint rushed on Marmelade, 
which was commanded by Vernet, a mulatto of a feeble
and distrustful mind, Having under his orders a legion 
composed of negroes recently liberated, as well disciplined as the
battalions of Toussaint, he, in his timidity, importuned the 
commission to send him succours. On the 20th of July, 1795, 
Polverel wrote him these lines: “We do not think you a traitor,
but you show not the courage of a republican; if you do not
feel strength enough to die rather than yield, say so frankly; we
can easily find citizens who make no account of death, when the
honour of their country is at stake.”</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 27th, Toussaint having formed 
connexions in the place, made an attack on Marmelade. By the
evening, opposition was overcome. Vernet, its commander,
joined his fortunes with those of Toussaint, whose niece he 
afterwards married, and rising to the rank of general, died under the
reign of the Haytian king Christophe. Meanwhile the 
Lieutenant-Colonel Desfournaux was advancing from Port-au-Prince
against Saint Michel, in the hope of effecting a division in
favour of the French civil authority. The republican troops
suffered a complete defeat. Desfournaux himself received several
wounds.</p>
            <p>Encouraged by the victory, Toussaint advanced and captured
Ennery. Thence he wrote to the inhabitants of Gonaïves, lying
on the western shore, to induce them to surrender. A rising
<hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> was attempted, and failed. The heads of the population
hastened to take flight by sea.</p>
            <p>But Toussaint had not been able sufficiently to protect his
<pb id="beard79" n="79"/>
rear. Hearing that Chanlatte was advancing from Plaisance
against him, he judged it prudent to retreat. Driven back to
Marmelade, he employed himself in efforts to abate the evils of
the war. Recalling the planters who had taken refuge in the
Spanish territories, he restored to them the possession of their
estates, and so prevented the destitution which the conflict
threatened to produce.</p>
            <p>These varieties of success brought no settlement. If the 
commissioners gained an advantage here, a defeat there countervailed 
its effect. Once more would they try an appeal to the
love of liberty. Accordingly Sonthonax proclaimed at the Cape
universal freedom. Polverel repeated the proclamation at 
Port-au-Prince. Symbolic ceremonies were celebrated on these 
occasions, which were repeated in various places in which the
authority of the commission still prevailed. The consequent 
enthusiasm was not without some effect. But Toussaint was not
easy to be deceived. The destinies of the republic were, he
knew, uncertain. The faith of its representatives in Hayti was
worse than doubtful. The colonists would be neither gained nor
overcome by an understanding with the civil commissioners. He
had, therefore, no course before him, but to continue faithful to
the king of Spain. His actual position was the only position he
could hold consistently with his hope of ever achieving the 
independence of his caste. For the complications of the contest he
was not answerable. If, therefore, he now had to defend the
cause of the blacks against blacks themselves, he had no option
but to submit to the painful necessity.</p>
            <p>Never, perhaps, did a conflict present more heterogeneous
combinations, or more regrettable collisions. The white republicans 
of France were arrayed against the white colonists of Hayti,
whom they were sent to succour. The black man's hand was
raised against his brother. The mulatto, enemy and friend of
both, was by both distrusted and destroyed. Constituted 
authorities were in hostility. Bands of injured men seeking redress
assailed each other. Spanish royalty fostered colonial insurrection. 
The forces of the country were exhausted in the mutual
and ever-recurring strife. Without unity, and without result,
<pb id="beard80" n="80"/>
the war raged on every side, uniform only in the universal
ravages which it inflicted.</p>
            <p>This ruinous complication was to be yet more complicated.
Discord threw on the wasted shores of Hayti another brand.</p>
            <p>We have already seen the planters make overtures to 
England. In their dissatisfaction with France, they renewed their
application. The Court of St. James instructed Williamson,
governor of Jamaica, to lend the required assistance. In this
appeal, the proprietors of La Grande Anse sent to the governor
a treaty, which was accepted. Among the points agreed on was
that the island should pass into the hands of Britain, and that
its representative should have full power to regulate and govern
the island with a view to its restoration to tranquillity. From
the <sic corr="tenor">tenour</sic> of this article, and from the express words of others,
the object of the colonists was to turn the power of Great Britain
to account, in order to effect that in which they themselves had
failed—the humiliation of the mulattoes, and the subjugation
of the blacks. With a view to the occupation of Hayti, Governor
Williams, in September, 1793, sent an armed force under Colonel
Whitelocke, which disembarked at Jéremie, on the 9th of the
month, and on the 22nd, the harbour of Saint Nicholas was put
into the possession of the English, who, in consequence, held two
important positions in Hayti, the latter at the extremity of the
northern, the other near the extremity of the southern tongue
of its western end. While the military chiefs of the mulattoes,
stood aloof, many of the men of colour, not being soldiers, threw
themselves into the arms of the British; and Saint Marc, Léogane,
Le Grand Goave, and many towns of the south, adopted the 
conditions of La Grande Anse.</p>
            <p>While little more than the Cape and Port-au-Prince remained
in the power of the commissioners, an English fleet anchored
in the harbour of the last-mentioned city, and demanded its
surrender. This armament received an increase shortly afterwards. 
As usual, dissension and treason were at work among
the forces of the authorities. With their aid, the English
effected a landing, and took up a position. The commissioners
fled to Jacmel. There they learned that a decree had been passed
<pb id="beard81" n="81"/>
against them by the national convention in Paris. They 
submitted, and were received as prisoners on board L'Espérance.
During the interval, Port-au-Prince became the scene of new
horrors. The emigrant Bérenger, at the head of a legion, took
possession of the town, and seizing Fort-Joseph, where the whites
had taken refuge who could not find room on board the vessels
in the harbour, he caused them to come forth one by one, and,
as they appeared, he threw them headlong from the rampart into
the fosse, saying, “Republican, leap down the Tarpeian rock.”
Thus perished two-and-thirty persons, and but for the orders of
the English general, not one would have been spared.</p>
            <p>England had not invaded the French part of Hayti without
having an understanding with Spain. By the convention 
between the two parties, it was agreed on that England should
establish its protection over the west and the south, and that
Spain should extend its dominion from the east to the extremity
of the north. Accordingly, while the English invaded the west
and the south, the Spanish invited the creoles of the north, who
had left the colony, to return and take possession of their 
properties. On the faith of the promises made to them, two 
hundred colonists quitted the United States, and entered their
homes at Fort Dauphin. Shortly after, Jean François, at the
head of a body of negroes, encamped under the walls of that
place. Resistance was not offered, in the persuasion that
they came only to second the operations of the Spaniards. The
next day, after the celebration of mass, those blacks mingled
with Spaniards, having formed themselves into bands, traversed
the streets, and slaughtered every Frenchman they met with, as
“enemies of the saints and of kings,”—to use the words by which
they were encouraged to the butchery by the priests. The 
massacre was general; only fourteen persons escaped.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile Rigaud, aided by Pétion and other mulatto chiefs,
attacked the English, and, taking from them Léogane and
Tiburon, blockaded them in La Grande Anse. Finding the
enemy formidable, Whitelocke endeavoured to bribe Rigaud and
Laveaux, then provisional governor of the colony, into 
acquiescence, if not submission. The former simply rejected the
<pb id="beard82" n="82"/>
offer; the latter replied, “Your being my enemy does not give
you the right to put on me a personal insult; as an individual
I demand satisfaction for the injury you have done me.”
Laveaux, believing the Cape indefensible, took up his position
at Port-de-Paix, which he fortified, and under its walls braved
all the efforts of the English; while they, on their side, 
occupying the harbour of Saint Nicholas, commanded all the 
approaches to the city by sea.</p>
            <p>The Spaniards, masters of nearly all the north, pressed 
Port-de-Paix by land, and cut off the supplies of provisions, so that
the place underwent the privations of a siege. “For more than
six months,” wrote Laveaux, under date May 24th, “we have
been reduced to six ounces of bread a day, officers as well as
men; but from the 13th of this month, we have none whatever,
the sick only excepted. If we had powder, we should have been
consoled; our misery is truly great; officers and soldiers 
experience the greatest privations. We have in our magazines
neither shoes, nor shirts, nor clothes, nor soap, nor tobacco. The
majority of the soldiers mount guard barefooted, like the
Africans. We have not even a flint to give the men. 
Notwithstanding, be assured that we will never surrender, if indeed, we
shall ever capitulate; be assured, too, that after us the enemy
will not find the slightest trace of Port-de-Paix. Sooner than
be made prisoners, when the balls shall have destroyed everything 
here, and we have no longer anything to defend, we will
retire, and flying from mountain to mountain, we will fight 
incessantly until aid comes from France.”</p>
            <p>Bravery and determination worthy of a better cause! The
hope of aid from France proved chimerical, yet the notion helped
to keep the soldiers in the line of duty. Relief, indeed, came to
them, but it was from an unexpected quarter.</p>
            <p>Miserably was this unfortunate island torn asunder by Spaniards,
French, English, mulattoes, and the blacks; by monarchists, by
republicans, by sceptics, by Romanists, by false friends and true
friends of negro emancipation. A lamentable illustration of the
diversity of these rival interests was presented at Saint Marc.
The same day three flags balanced and negatived each other under
<pb id="beard83" n="83"/>
the influence of political breezes. Four cockades symbolized four
different sets of opinions: here were whites who wore the black
cockade; there other whites who wore the white cockade; while
the mulattoes wore the red cockade; and some soldiers wore the
tri-coloured cockade.</p>
            <p>About this time may be dated the final change which the
name of Toussaint underwent by receiving the addition of
L'Ouverture. L'Ouverture is a French word which signifies
<hi rend="italics">the opening.</hi> The surname is said to have been given as indicative 
of the opening which Toussaint had made for himself in
the ranks and the possessions of the enemy. If this was its
origin, the name is appropriate. Though not always successful,
he rushed on his foes with an impetus which mowed down
opposition. With poetic licence, Lamartine, in his drama, makes
the designation—derived, according to him, from L'Aurore,
<hi rend="italics">Day-break</hi>—to have been given to Toussaint by a monk, who
thus intimated to him that he was to be the morning-star of a
new era in Hayti.</p>

to his people that he was about to open the door to them of a
better future. In this view his name became a token of his
object. That object he was too prudent to make known in the
early period of his efforts. Now, however, might he make the
announcement without serious risk. The event justified his
conduct. That event would be aided forward by the name. <hi rend="italics">The</hi>
<pb id="beard84" n="84"/>
<hi rend="italics">opening</hi> was before the negroes. Whenever they saw Toussaint,
they were reminded of the opening; whenever they pronounced
his name, they were encouraged to advance toward the opening.
There was the door; they had only to be bold and enter in to the
desired temple of freedom.</p>
            <p>Toussaint L'Ouverture had returned to his mountain stronghold, 
Marmalade, where he fixed his head-quarters. From
that place as a centre, he surveyed the whole island, which to a
great extent he now held under his domination. Already the
shepherd-boy had become a potentate. It was a time not only
for repose, but for the endearments of home. From the time of
his entering the service of Spain, he had removed his wife
from the theatre of war. He himself conducted her to the
mountain fastness of St. Miguel; and for seven months he
had not been able to pay her a visit. Kind-hearted as he was,
how must he have been moved, when now, after unexpected
triumphs, he found his wife and children in safety. His entrance
into the place was an ovation. The commander, in a truly
Spanish fashion, ordered, among other tokens of rejoicing, 
bullfights, in honour of the victor. Toussaint L'Ouverture had
gained the esteem as well as the confidence of his Spanish
masters. Impressed with his respect for religion, as well as the
general probity of his character, the Marquis Hermona, under
whose orders he was, exclaimed, on seeing him take the communion:
—“No, God cannot, in this lower world, visit a purer
soul.” Thus esteemed by the Spaniards, feared by the English,
dreaded by the French, hated by the planters, and reverenced
by the negroes, Toussaint L'Ouverture felt that a crisis had come
in his public life, which required the calmest consideration and
the soundest judgment. His achievements, his personal 
influence, and the condition of the conflicting parties, combined to
show him the opening door, if only he had wisdom and strength
to take the right path. What was that path? The colonists
were all but deprived of power for harm. The mulattoes had
no organization. The English held only a point or two of the
country. From the colonists and the men of colour little, very
little, was to be feared or hoped. The negroes had learnt the
<pb id="beard85" n="85"/>
secret of their power. This result, if no other satisfactory result, 
had ensued from the conflict. On them might Toussaint 
L'Ouverture now place great reliance. If they were not already 
good soldiers, they had performed great things, and gave 
promise of soon being able both to deserve and achieve independence. 
But was their emancipation to be gained through Spain? Spain 
was powerful in Hayti; was its power likely to conduce to the 
opening? On the contrary, Spain was opposed to emancipation. 
Her power, then, was power adverse to the great object of 
Toussaint L'Ouverture's life. What did fidelity to that object 
demand? Before the question could be answered, another
element of thought had to be weighed. France in Hayti was in 
a miserable condition. Should she be crushed? If she was 
crushed, the alternative lay between the slave-dominion of 
England and the slave-dominion of Spain. But though France 
was depressed, could she be crushed? Her arms were triumphant 
in Europe, and a strong effort to rescue her favourite 
colony might reasonably be expected. The present depression 
was such as to call for gratitude towards any effectual helper. 
The possible continuance of the depression gave assurance of the 
probability that, even in opposition to France, still more in
conjunction with France, the independence of the negroes—if not 
the independence of the island—might be achieved. Why, 
then, not seek “the opening” in union with France? The 
disposition implied in the question was confirmed by a recent 
decree of the French legislature (Feb. 4, 1794) which, declaring 
Hayti an integral part of France, confirmed and proclaimed the 
freedom of all the slaves. This was a very grave act; an act 
of the mother country, not a mere device of a local commissioner; 
this was a deliberate and solemn recognition of the very object 
of Toussaint's life, not a trick in war for the very purpose of 
frustrating that object. And this step was taken when, to 
some extent, the days of French republican weakness had given 
place to days of strength, and when the name of republican 
France had begun to become a terror in the world. Hence, 
many things pointed to a coalition with France—her weakness, 
her power, her liberality. Alliance, too, with her seemed the
<pb id="beard86" n="86"/>
natural course. Independence by her, with her, and eventually
—if it might be—without her, involved the introduction of
no foreign element into the Haytian world; no new language,
no strange customs and unacceptable manners. A French
colony would still remain essentially French. Old usages would
remain in honour; old observances would not be trampled on;
old associations would not be disregarded or broken up. 
Especially would religion remain uninjured and unchanged. Hayti
was a Catholic island, and France was a Catholic country.
Toussaint L'Ouverture, too, was a sincere Catholic. Religious
considerations, always powerful with him, seem to have 
received special attention, and had special weight in this juncture.
The Abbé de la Haie was his adviser. The same clergyman
went between him and Laveaux. At length, a distinct offer
was made by the French commander. Toussaint L'Ouverture
accepted <hi rend="italics">the opening.</hi></p>
            <p>In this important step, he was doubtless influenced by a 
consideration derived from his actual position. He was surrounded
by violent men. He was, in some sort, under the control of
violent men. Certainly, he was intimately allied with men of
colour by whom, or with whom, negro emancipation could not
be wrought out. Of these facts he, about this time, was made
painfully aware. His superior in command, Jean François,
quarrelled with Biassou. Over the latter, Toussaint, as the former
knew, possessed great influence. Choosing to implicate Toussaint
in the quarrel, Jean François committed him to prison. By
Biassou, he was delivered. The hazard had been great. He who
could incarcerate might slay. A second peril of the kind was
not to be thought of; therefore, the great, the final step must be
taken. Having adopted precautions for the safety of his family,
he made his military arrangements with skill, and carried them
into effect with success. He then proclaimed universal liberty
in all the districts under his influence. On the 4th of
May, he pulled down the Spanish and hoisted the French flag
wherever he was in power. Fright and confusion prevailed
among the Spaniards. Joy agitated the bosoms of the negroes.
Nearly all the north returned to their allegiance to France.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
            <argument>
              <p>Toussaint defeats the Spanish<sic corr="partisans"> partizans</sic>—By extraordinary exertions raises and
disciplines troops, forms armies, lays out campaigns, executes the most
daring exploits, and defeats the English, who evacuate the island—Toussaint
is Commander-in-chief.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>TOUSSAINT L'OUVERTURE'S accession to the cause of France was
followed by brilliant exploits. Rigaud suddenly fell on Léogane,
which had been surrendered to the English, and with a very 
inconsiderable loss carried the place, though it had been strongly
fortified. Among the booty were twenty thousand pounds of
powder, eight of which he sent to Laveaux, who, with his 
fellow-combatants in Port-de-Paix, hailed the capture of Léogane with
shouts of delight.</p>
            <p>Toussaint now came into collision with Jean François, his
former commander. He took from that Spanish ally all his posts,
and drove him westward into La Montaigne Noire. Hastening
into the valley of the Artibonite, Toussaint attacked the English,
and, capturing several towns, fell on Saint Marc, the seat of the
English power. Sitting down to besiege the city, he got 
possession of two important posts. In one of these, Morne-Diamant,
he raised a battery which riddled the place. Then, while aiding
the men to mount a gun, he crushed his left hand. He was
compelled to resign the conduct of the attack to others. The
consequence was injurious. Besides, his forces were 
insufficiently provided with ammunition. He was forced to retire.
This partial failure occasioned perfidy in some of his forces,
to which he himself nearly fell a victim. Thus, while he had to
maintain an open warfare against Spain and England, he had
also to guard against the treachery which those powers did not
disdain to set in motion among his own adherents.</p>
            <p>Retiring, as was his custom, to the mountain fastnesses, of
which Marmelade may be considered as the centre, he collected
<pb id="beard88" n="88"/>
forces, and on the 9th of October, 1794, quitted that place at 
the head of nearly five thousand men, and after some minor 
successes, carried San Miguel by storm.</p>
            <p>This exploit raised him high in the estimation of the French
commanders. Laveaux and Rigaud united in their eulogies 
of the skill and prowess he had manifested. An interview took 
place between Laveaux and Toussaint at Dondon. This was 
the first time they had seen each other. Toussaint presented to 
the general-in-chief his principal officers; Dessalines, commander
of San Miguel, Duménil, commander of Plaisance, Desrouleaux,
Clerveaux, Maurepas, &amp;c., commanders of battalions.</p>
            <p>Toussaint L'Ouverture had already become a great power. 
Very considerable influence did he exert in this conference of 
French authorities.</p>
            <p>Raised to this eminence, and now seeing “the opening” in 
clear outline before him, Toussaint was indefatigable. Such was 
the rapidity of his movements, and at so many different places 
was he seen near the same moment, that he seemed, especially in 
the eyes of the ignorant negroes, as if he was superior to time and 
space. Specially was he found at every post of imminent danger. 
His energy and his prowess made him the idol of his 
troops. They also caused him to be dreaded by his enemies. He 
was no longer a leader of insurgents, but a commander of an 
army. He gave over marauding expeditions to lay out and 
conduct a campaign.</p>
            <p>His immediate aim was to drive the English out of the island, 
and for that purpose, to make himself master of the port of Saint 
Marc. Coming down from the mountains with this view, he 
found that the English commander, Brisbane, had advanced into 
the interior of the valley of the Artibonite, and, taking Les 
Vérettes, had compelled his troops to retire. One small position 
alone held out against Brisbane. Toussaint determined to make 
one of those efforts which he so well knew how to direct, and 
by which he sometimes effected at a blow very great 
results. Starting forward in the night early in December, with 
a band of three hundred cavalry, he by ambuscade and sudden
attack, drove the enemy back in disgrace.</p>
            <pb id="beard89" n="89"/>
            <p>As yet, however, he had not strength enough to hold the
valley of the Artibonite, especially as Jean François, with his
Spanish sympathies, was impending over it in order to assist the
English. He withdrew towards the north. Before he left La
Petite Rivière for Gonaïves, which is in that direction, he gave
a proof of the humanity by which he was actuated. In the 
village of La Petite Rivière, there were children and women of
different colours who were destitute of the means of subsistence.
Two sisters of charity who had come hither from the quarters
occupied by the English, ministered to others even in their own
need. At the command of L'Ouverture bread was day by day
supplied to these sufferers, and to the most wretched of them
money also was distributed.</p>
            <p>Returning with almost the speed of lightning to Marmelade,
he set about organising a sufficient force to clear the district of
La Grande Rivière and its heights, which lie above Saint Marc,
of the bands of Jean François. Setting in movement four
columns, he quitted Dondon in the centre of the forces on the
31st of December. In four days he took and destroyed 
twenty-eight positions. That of Barmby, situated on a frightful 
precipice, and defended by three pieces of cannon, besides fire-arms,
was carried by the mere force of resolute bravery. Had his plan
been carried into effect in all points, the insurrection would have
been suppressed. It failed in one point; and so gave a passage
to Jean François, who, passing through it with superior forces,
surrounded Toussaint L'Ouverture. Disappointed, that brave
man cut a way through his enemies, and after establishing a
cordon of great extent, returned to his stronghold, Dondon, on
the 7th of January, 1795.</p>
            <p>The cordon of the west, which Ouverture commanded, had for
its eastern extremity La Grande Riviére, in the centre of the
department of the north, and for its western limit La Saline, in
the plain of the Artibonite, in the department of the west, and
extending above ninety leagues, comprised the following important 
posts: Saint Raphael, Saint Miguel, Dondon, Marmelade, 
and Gonaïves. This vast space of country Toussaint
L'Ouverture defended for a long time against the English, the
<pb id="beard90" n="90"/>
Spanish, and against French emigrants, with troops badly armed,
badly disciplined, and little accustomed to military manœuvres.
This single fact is evidence of his prodigious activity and 
surpassing talent. He had, indeed, under him officers of activity.
But genius was demanded in his difficult and perilous position,
and genius Toussaint himself alone possessed. Not only had he
to survey and sustain the whole, but each particular part 
required his presence as well as his thoughts. At every threatened 
point must Toussaint himself be, and at every threatened
point Toussaint was. Constantly in motion, he and his horse
seemed almost one compound being. In the midst of active
movements he had to satisfy the daily demands of a voluminous
correspondence, which he always dictated with his own lips.
Very needful too, was it that he should do his utmost to 
encourage the cultivation of the lands, lest provisions should fail
his troops, or famine try the fidelity of the people. Nor was
the maintenance of discipline in hands such as his an easy office
or a slight labour. He accomplished the task, however, by a
general course of consideration and mildness as well as by stern
severity toward the disobedient.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile the king of Spain ceded to France all his possessions 
and rights in Hayti. The cession inflamed the hopes of
the English government, who, resolving to try a last effort, sent,
under General Howe, an army of three thousand men, together
with a fleet under Admiral Parker.</p>
            <p>Laveaux had fallen into peril. Instigated by jealousy, Rigaud
and Villate, another man of colour, arrested General Laveaux
and threw him into prison. This attempt to set up a mulatto
domination was overcome by Toussaint. Grateful for the service,
Laveaux appointed Toussaint his second in the government of
the island of Hayti, and in the proclamation which he thereupon
issued, declared him to be that Spartacus, foretold by Raynal,
whose destiny it was to avenge the outrages inflicted on all his
race; and whom he set forth as the vindicator of the constituted
authorities, adding that in future nothing should be attempted
except in concert with him, and by his councils. This association 
of Toussaint in the government sensibly amended the 
<pb id="beard91" n="91"/>
disposition of the blacks, who now began to have some confidence
in their white superiors, and in consequence were, in large 
numbers, prepared to obey.</p>
            <p>Sonthonax having overcome his enemies in France, returned
to Hayti, at the head of a commission of which Roume
was the other important member. The commissioners found
the colony in a condition approaching to prosperity. Instead of
profiting by the favourable dispositions that prevailed, and the
special good feeling with which he was received, Sonthonax 
preferred stirring men's passions afresh. He had formed the
project of bringing the men of colour under subjection by the
power of the law. In order to effect his purpose, he, ostensibly
to reward Toussaint L'Ouverture for the conduct he had 
pursued in the recent troubles, appointed that distinguished man
general of division. These measures irritated Rigaud, the champion 
of the mulattoes, who saw, with extreme jealousy, the
black chief elevated to a rank superior to his own. Obeyed
over almost all the south, Rigaud was deaf to overtures
made to him on the part of the commissioners, and in 
discontent withdrew to Tiburon.</p>
            <p>Toussaint L'Ouverture was not a man to lose time. Aware of
the reinforcements the English had received, he hastened to the
seat of war in the west, and having driven back Colonel Brisbane, 
who had invaded La Petite Rivière, he pushed forward to
Saline, near Gonaïves, which the English had set on fire, and
on the shore near which they had effected a landing. The
English were on the point of advancing, when Toussaint appeared.
Putting himself at the head of the cavalry, he fell on the
English at Guildive, and directing the charge in his own person,
he compelled them to re-embark in confusion, with the loss of their
standards, their baggage, and their cannon. Toussaint received
injuries in the conflict, but Brisbane was mortally wounded.
The victorious soldiers, having their muskets crowned with
laurels, were received in Gonaïves in the midst of the 
acclamations of the people.</p>
            <p>The influence of Toussaint L'Ouverture grew every day.
Almost at will, he drew the negroes round his banners, and
<pb id="beard92" n="92"/>
reduced them into discipline. He also detached from the 
English colours bands which they had taken into their pay. 
Applying himself to matters connected with the general 
administration of the colony, he put on a firm footing the prosperity 
which had begun to appear. He applied his power specially 
to the restoration of the culture of the soil; wisely declaring, 
that the liberty of the blacks could be consolidated only by the 
prosperity of agriculture. This important averment, spreading 
among the black chiefs, awoke in them the desire to acquire 
and to conserve property.</p>
            <p>While the English had great difficulty to struggle against the
French arms in the west, they were vigorously pressed by
Desfourneaux in the north. Four columns surrounded the 
heights of Vallière, where the enemy, with the aid of some detachments, 
kept up what they called “La Vendée of Saint Domingo.” 
Henry Christophe, afterwards King of Hayti, powerfully 
contributed to the success of this expedition. In the south, 
Rigaud assumed the offensive. Having strongly fortified Les 
Cayes, be marched to attack Port-au-Prince. He met with a 
resistance so vigorous, so brave, and so well-conducted that 
any but a very superior man must have perished. In a sally 
made by Colonel Markham, at the head of a thousand men, his 
outposts were carried, and his head-quarters plundered. The 
rout was becoming general, when Rigaud, though urged to 
save his life by flight, leaped on his horse, and rallying fifty 
men, threw himself on the English occupied in pillage, and put 
many of them to the sword. The plunder was recovered, and 
Markham, forced to beat a retreat, fell pierced with balls.</p>
            <p>L'Ouverture, not slow in sustaining the efforts of Rigaud, sat 
down before Saint Marc with ten thousand men. Thrice did 
he assail the town in vain. After prodigies of valour, he was 
compelled to retire.</p>
            <p>Unwilling to derive no advantage from his exertions, Toussaint
determined to rescue Mirebalais out of the hands of the Spaniards, 
by whom it was held. At his voice, the population rose 
in a mass, and, with his assistance, made him master of the 
district.</p>
            <pb id="beard93" n="93"/>
            <p>Mirebalais was a most important post. Lying in the mountains 
on the north-east corner of the western department, the
district so called consisted of gorges, steeps, and narrow passes,
which made almost every part of it a Thermopylæ. The village
of Saint Louis, also called by the name of the district, commands
an immense extent of level country. Favourable to animal life
in general, the country abounds in superior horses. A skilful
commander, possessed of Mirebalais, therefore, might almost defy
attack, and at his pleasure sally forth to wage war in almost
any part of the island.</p>
            <p>The English, aware of the importance of this position, resolved
to get it into their hands. They succeeded in the bold 
undertaking.</p>
            <p>The loss was too heavy to be endured. L'Ouverture, as
soon as other duties permitted, made arrangements for the
recovery of Mirebalais. He was not in time, however, to prevent
the occupants from covering it with fortifications. The command
of the district had been entrusted to a French emigrant,
the Count de Bruges, whose forces amounted to two thousand
English troops of the line, besides a numerous militia. On the
24th of March, 1797, Toussaint L'Ouverture, by means of his
lieutenant, Morney, intercepted the high road leading into the
country, and encamping at Block-haus du Gros Figuier, repelled
Montalembert, who was advancing into Mirebalais with seven
hundred men and two pieces of artillery. The next day, 
Toussaint drove the English from all their possessions, and completing
the investment of the village, ordered, on the south, the attack
of the forts. With such unity of operation, and such impetuosity 
of assault was the attack made, that the whole was carried.
Conflagration completed what the fire-arms left unsubdued.
Toussaint L'Ouverture passed from eminence to eminence, and
surveyed his troops victorious on all sides. A yet more pleasing
sight to him was that which he had when he set at liberty two
hundred prisoners of all hues who were suffering under
a degrading punishment, and who every moment expected a
horrible death from the flames which were approaching the place
of their detention.</p>
            <pb id="beard94" n="94"/>
            <p>Pursuing his advantages, L'Ouverture, in a campaign of fourteen 
days, totally defeated the English, and brought under obedience 
the entire province. Among his spoils were eleven pieces
of cannon, with their ammunition, and two hundred prisoners.
As his recompence, Toussaint L'Ouverture received from 
Sonthonax the appointment of commander-in-chief of the army of
Saint Domingo, vacant by the departure of Laveaux. The
conquering hero was installed at the Cape in the presence of the
garrison, composed of black troops, and the remains of the white
troops. These are the words which he employed on the occasion:
—“Citizen Commissioners, I accept the eminent rank to
which you have just raised me, only in the hope of more surely
succeeding in entirely extirpating the enemies of Saint Domingo,
of contributing to its speedy restoration to prosperity, and of
securing the happiness of its inhabitants. If to fulfil the difficult 
task which it imposes, it sufficed to wish the good of the
island, and to effect it, in all that depends on me, I hope that,
with the aid of the Divine Being, I shall succeed; the tyrants
are cast down on the earth; they will no more defile the places
where the standard of liberty and equality ought to float alone,
and where the sacred rights of man ought to be recognised.</p>
            <p>“Officers and soldiers, if there is a compensation in the severe
labours which I am about to enter on, I shall find it in the 
satisfaction of commanding brave soldiers. Let the sacred fire of
liberty animate us, and let us never take repose until we have
prostrated the foe.”</p>
            <p>Lofty now was the position of Toussaint L'Ouverture. Glad
was his heart. His joy did not arise from his own personal
elevation. It is true that he had created an army which could
beat European troops, and expel them from even the strongholds
of Hayti. It is true that in his deeds and warlike achievements
he had equalled the great captains of ancient and modern times.
But he had not fought for his own aggrandisement; he had done
all with a view to an ultimate object. And now that object
seemed within his reach. The emancipation of his race was
accomplished, therefore did Toussaint rejoice. “The opening”
<pb id="beard95" n="95"/>
was made; what remained to be done was detail. Alas! such
were the appearances, but the appearances proved delusions.</p>
            <p>The achievement just set forth gave the final blow to the
war. No longer could the English do more than maintain a
desultory conflict with scarcely any hope of final success, 
whatever temporary advantages they might gain. When all but
relieved from a foreign enemy, the French authorities began to
disagree among themselves. The particulars are too tedious to
be repeated. From the colony appeals were made to the legislature 
in Paris. The commissioner Sonthonax, fearing impeachment, 
requested to be sent home as a deputy from the colony.
If at first sincere, he seems afterwards to have vacillated. 
Toussaint, however, convinced that his absence would be conducive
to the restoration of harmony and the effective prosecution of
hostilities, took measures that his request should not fail of effect.
But Toussaint, victorious and powerful in the colony, had reason
to fear the result of intrigues and plots against himself in the
mother country. As a pledge of his honour and a token of 
confidence, he sent his two sons to France for their education. On
their part the English, suffering greatly from the climate, and
making no progress towards the subjugation of the island,
employed the utmost of their power to seduce the hostile leaders.
Having with little satisfaction to themselves attempted to secure
the mulatto interest, they made the bold attempt of seducing
Toussaint L'Ouverture himself. Little knowing the character
of the man with whom they dealt, they offered as the price of
his subserviency the title of King of Hayti. The incorruption
of Toussaint on the occasion was the more remarkable and
worthy, as General Hédouville, sent after the departure of
Sonthonax as the representative of France, treated him with less
consideration than was deserved by the man to whom that
country owed the restoration of its colony. Toussaint had,
indeed, become too powerful perhaps for France, certainly for
its deputy Hédouville. In his anxiety to disembarrass himself
of the black chief, that general, by means of his creatures, tried
to induce him to embark for the mother country, in order to
<pb id="beard96" n="96"/>
plead his cause and maintain his interests. Pointing with his
hand to a sapling which grew near—“I will go,” he said, “when
that branch shall form a vessel of sufficient size to carry me
thither.”</p>
            <p>During these unhappy divisions, the English had been losing
ground. Worn down and dispirited, they at length began to
take decided steps for the evacuation of the island. In the
negotiations and measures which this involved, the polemics and
distrusts of the French authorities displayed but too strongly
their evil effects. Port-au-Prince, however, was surrendered by
the English, who shortly afterwards found it prudent to place
the Môle Saint-Nicholas in the hands of the French. 
Dissatisfied with the stipulations made by Hédouville, Toussaint
repaired to Saint-Marc, and took into his own hands the settlement 
of the terms of capitulation. Not yet wholly without
hope of winning over to English views their most formidable
opponent, the English by their representative, General Maitland,
rendered the highest honours to Toussaint L'Ouverture. The
attempt met with deserved failure. Toussaint could see through
the covered designs of his old foes. He had no faith that the
freedom of his race would ensue from English domination; and
he knew that their equality before the law had been recognised
by France. Faithful to his great idea and final design, he
remained superior to the blandishments of English wealth and
adulation. After enduring so many fatigues and acquiring so
much glory, L'Ouverture retired into the interior of the 
Artibonite, and took up his abode on the estate called Deschaux,
which was situated in the mountains. There he flattered himself
with the hope of some repose, and there, keeping an eye over the
great centres of social movement, he could at any moment, like
the eagle, descend to any part where his presence was required.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
            <argument>
              <p>Toussaint L'Ouverture composes agitation, and brings back prosperity—Is
opposed by the Commissioner, Hédouville, who flies to France—Appeals, in
self-justification, to the Directory in Paris.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HAVING reached the commanding position which he held, 
Toussaint L'Ouverture, with a true patriotism and a wise benevolence, 
applied himself to the difficult task of healing the wounds
of his country. The first task was to induce the planters to
resume possession of their estates, and re-commence the tillage
of the soil. This he effected in part by persuasion, in part by
gentle compulsion; numerous detachments of infantry, traversing
the cities, collected together the scattered owners and conducted
them to the plantations. The conduct of the troops employed
in the service was as worthy of notice as the obedience of
the agriculturists; for, observing the strictest discipline, they
showed the greatest respect to property, and conducted 
themselves towards all with becoming moderation and mildness.
The control over these rude natures which this temperance
implied, was the result of the discipline instituted by Toussaint,
and of the love and the fear which his name inspired. Among his
signal triumphs this was, perhaps, the most signal. Not by
blacks only, but by whites, was this extraordinary man obeyed.
Obedience secured Toussaint's protection. Regardless of the
colour of the skin, he received with favour, and treated with
confidence, and promoted with readiness, all whom he had valid
reasons for believing sincerely bent on advancing the public good.
Disdaining to govern by the rivalry of classes, he aimed to serve
the whole, by the means and with the aid of each. Emigrant or
creole, black or white, men were treated by him as men; being
placed in the posts for which they were fitted, whether military
or civil. If there was a difference in his conduct towards
dependents, that difference was not in favour of white men.
The injured, he rightly judged, had the first claim to his attention.
<pb id="beard98" n="98"/>
Generally, however, his administration was impartial,
severely impartial.</p>
            <p>It scarcely need be added that he grew in universal estimation.
Respected by men in general, his influence became immense,
and even the fear or distrust which was secretly nourished
against him by some, was an acknowledgment of his power.
Under Toussaint's benign sway, parties began to melt away,
and heart-burnings to cease. An unqualified amnesty, which he
proclaimed, tranquillized men's minds, and reconciled them to
the existing state of things.</p>
            <p>Nor did the victorious general forget the All-powerful Arm
to which he knew that he owed his triumph, and by whose aid
only, he was equally assured, he could finish the work he had
begun and so far accomplished.</p>
            <p>But the governor disapproved of L'Ouverture's policy.
Whether from a difference of view, or from suspecting Toussaint
of ambitious designs, Hédouville, though a professed Republican,
characterized his administration as “too mild and too full of
results.” Never having behaved towards the negro captain with
cordiality, he now conveyed to Toussaint's ears words of open
complaint and covert blame. Toussaint was not to be turned
from a course which he had deliberately adopted, and found to
be most beneficial. Afraid lest Hédouville's power would
interrupt that course, or abate its good, he issued proclamations
to his troops—his chief basis of reliance—in order to confirm
them in their obedience by the strongest of ties, namely, the
religious ties to which their susceptible and impulsive natures
made them peculiarly sensible. “This,” said he, “is the path
which we must all follow, in order to draw down upon us the
blessing of the Lord. I hope you will never depart from it,
and that you will punctually execute what follows:—</p>
            <p>“The heads of regiments are required to see that the troops
join in prayer morning and evening, as far as the service will
permit.</p>
            <p>“At the earliest review, the Generals Commanding-in-chief,
will cause high mass to be celebrated and a Te Deum to be
sung in all the places of their several districts, as an expression
<pb id="beard99" n="99"/>
of gratitude to Heaven for having vouchsafed to direct our last
campaigns; for having caused the evacuation of the enemy to 
take place without effusion of blood; for having protected the 
return amongst us of many thousand men of every colour, who 
till then had been lost; and, finally, for having restored to the 
labours of agriculture more than twenty thousand hands. The 
<hi rend="italics">Te Deum</hi> will be announced by a salvo of twenty-two pieces of 
cannon.”</p>
            <p>Under the effects of words so religious and so just, the credit
of Hédouville was greatly lessened; in proportion as L'Ouverture
gained ascendancy, he sank, until he retained among his 
supporters only those who were immediately around him, such as 
his officials, Frenchmen who were foreigners in the colony, and 
others who, from personal connexions with the mother country, 
desired to maintain its power in the hands of its agents.</p>
            <p>The contrast was made greater by the diverse course pursued 
by the two in regard to the cultivators of the soil. While 
Hédouville unconditionally declared all the blacks free, 
Toussaint wisely prefixed to their actual freedom a kind of 
apprenticeship for five years, on condition of their receiving one-fourth 
of the produce, out of which the masters were to defray the 
cost of their subsistence. The plan of the governor, speciously 
designed to catch the popular breeze, would have issued in 
universal disorder. Instead of immediate emancipation, always 
pregnant with present and future disasters, Toussaint interposed 
a period of preparation, and in so doing, saved the property of 
the masters, as well as promoted the interests of the servants. 
So wise and moderate a use of his triumph and his power
probably saved Hayti from the terrors of a universal convulsion, 
and certainly raised him to a high position in the respect of all 
impartial and judicious men.</p>
            <p>Hédouville, aware to what an extent he had lost the public
confidence, took measures for provoking a movement contrary 
to Toussaint among the men of colour. Rigaud he accordingly 
invited to the seat of government. As a cover, he invited 
Toussaint also to take part in the conference. But the negro 
chief was as wary as he was bold; and he may have heard that
<pb id="beard100" n="100"/>
some time previously officers of Hédouville's staff had offered to
seize his person, if only their master would put four brave
soldiers at their disposal.</p>
            <p>Remaining at Port-au-Prince, Toussaint was informed that
Rigaud was on his way to the Cape. The commander of that
place, and several black officers, advised Toussaint to intercept
and apprehend Rigaud. “I could,” he replied, “easily do so; but
God forbid. I have need of Rigaud. He is violent. I want
him for carrying on war; and that war is necessary to me.
The mulatto caste is superior to my own. If I take Rigaud
from them, they would perhaps find another superior to him.
I know Rigaud; he gives up the bridle when he gallops; he
shows his arm when he strikes. For me, I gallop also; but I
know where to stop; and when I strike, I am felt, not seen.
M. Rigaud can conduct insurrections only by blood and 
massacres; I know how to put the people in movement; but when
I appear, all must be tranquil.”</p>
            <p>A general feeling of uneasiness spread abroad. Fear began
to prevail. A counter-revolution seemed at hand. The blacks
were uneasy, especially those who had compromised themselves
in taking part with the English. The mulattoes were regarded
with alarm. In Fort-Saint-Dauphin, a regiment ran to arms,
declaring that the whites wished to restore slavery. A combat
took place between the black troops and the white troops. The
former being beaten, spread over the open country, which they
raised on all sides. Then, once more, conflagration committed
its ravages. Many unfortunate whites, taken by surprise on
their estates, were slaughtered. The insurgents marched to the
Cape. Toussaint hastened to the seat of the insurrection. The
blacks were raging as in former days. Suddenly their chief
appeared, and all was peaceful. Undertaking to be the exponent
of their griefs, he led them to Cape City. The moment he
arrived there, the alarm was given by the authorities, who seem
to have desired a rencontre. The troops were assembled, but
the effort proved nugatory. By little and little, the soldiers
deserted their posts when they knew that Toussaint was at
hand. Hédouville, failing in his <hi rend="italics">coup d'etat,</hi> embarked to return
<pb id="beard101" n="101"/>
to France. From on board the ship he published a proclamation,
in which, being no longer able to profit by the prejudices of
colour, he sought his account by appealing to national jealousies,
and declared that Toussaint L'Ouverture was sold to the English.</p>
            <p>The movement was at an end. The plotter was on his way
back to France, and the regenerator of his country found 
himself in a freer field, and possessed of augmented resources. No
less single than pure in his aims, Toussaint L'Ouverture rose in
general regard and public confidence, even by the contrarieties
which the Governor had thrown in his way. By the failure of
the recent plot, too, the mulatto interest, considered as hostile
to the interest of other classes, received a heavy blow.</p>
            <p>As soon as General Hédouville had set sail, the blacks were
not only tranquil, but obedient to the eye and the finger of
their chief. Every one silently resumed his habitudes. The
most perfect calm succeeded the most raging tempest. A
<hi rend="italics">Te Deum</hi> was chanted, and the name of Toussaint L'Ouverture
was mingled with the Hallowed Name in the uttered gratitude
of thousands. Toussaint was not insensible to the homage, and
he desired the complete accomplishment of his mission. But he
had seen the edifice he had so carefully and painfully raised,
put in danger with only too much facility. The mulatto party,
though weakened, were still powerful. At their head was
Rigaud, who had not shown himself averse to the designs of
his caste. Toussaint dreaded a collision. Possibly he himself
was a hindrance to a peaceful and permanent settlement. 
Entertaining no merely personal objects, he gave utterance to a
desire to be relieved of his weighty responsibilities. At a
moment when, by a bold stroke, he might have set up a throne,
and perhaps established a dynasty, he asked for his dismissal.
The word called forth a universal remonstrance. The civil
and the military authorities, the white, black, and brown
inhabitants, the proprietors and the labourers, all combined in
laying before him formal addresses, in which they entreated him
to remain, to use their own terms, “their father and their
benefactor.”</p>
            <p>But there was a court of appeal. Before that tribunal
<pb id="beard102" n="102"/>
Hédouville would appear with singular advantage. Toussaint
knew the disparity of his means for obtaining a fair hearing,
but he resolved to employ such as were at his command.
Accordingly, he sent Colonel Vincent, one of his secretaries,
to explain and justify his conduct before the French Government, 
then in the hands of the Directory. Colonel Vincent
was the bearer of a letter, of which the following contains the
principal passages:—</p>
            <p>“Toussaint L'Ouverture, General-in-Chief of the army of Saint
Domingo, to the Directory of the Republic:</p>
            <p>“CITIZEN DIRECTORS,—When in my last dispatches I determined 
to request my dismissal, I did so because, after having
collected all the instances of opposition to the principles which
the Constitution has established, which your wisdom has 
maintained, which your energy has defended,—all the instances of
opposition, I say, manifested in conduct held by the agent
Hédouville during the short space of time which he governed this
colony,—foresaw the unhappy event which for an instant 
disturbed the public tranquillity I had had so much trouble to
establish; and I did go after having calculated the consequences
of the distance at which he held himself from me, and of which
he gave public proofs on several occasions, fearing that my
deposition, which he meditated, would be the reward of my long
services, of my fidelity, and of my devotedness.</p>
            <p>“The incident at Fort-Dauphin realized my apprehensions as
to the convulsion for which preparations were made, and the
proclamation which the agent put forth at the moment of his
departure has justified my fears regarding the fate he intended
for me.</p>
            <p>“The most outrageous injury which can be done to a man of
honour crowns the vexations which he has made me undergo.
By this perfidious act he causes a vast number of Frenchmen to
quit these lands who had congratulated themselves on their 
happiness here, and who, faithful to their country, were compelled
to sacrifice their interests, rather than become accomplices in the
crime of independence of which I was regarded as guilty; he
carries with him, especially, the principal authorities, that (as he
<pb id="beard103" n="103"/>
said on leaving) they may be the irrefragable proof of my 
duplicity, of my perfidy.</p>
            <p>“Doubtless the first feeling of the Directory, whom I respect,
on seeing them unanimously bear witness against me, will be to
invoke vengeance on my head; that of the French people, whom I
love, to devote me to execration; and that of the enemies of the
blacks, whom I despise, to cry out for slavery; but when it shall
be known that at the time which I was accused of wishing to 
sunder this island from France, my benefactress, I repeated the oath
of fidelity to her, I take pleasure in believing that the government 
I own, and my fellow- citizens, will render me the justice
I merit, and that the enemies of my brethren will be reduced to
silence.</p>
            <p>“The Agent, in reality, surrounded himself only with persons
in the colony sunk in public opinion, ambitious and intriguing,
who caress all the factions which have torn this unfortunate
country. A band of young men, of no character and no 
principles, who came with him, then threw away the mask, and
manifested a spirit both anti-national and insulting to me.</p>
            <p>“The labourers who began to taste the sweets of repose in the
midst of security, were surprised at the impure sounds which
struck their ear, and wounded their heart. I became the 
depository of their griefs, and I composed their minds by assuring
them of the good intentions of the agent of a benevolent government; 
but they soon accused me myself of partiality, having
become certain that even at the table of the General Agent they
were denounced as unworthy of the liberty they enjoy, and which
they have derived from the equity of France.</p>
            <p>“Often did the Agent reproach me with having received 
emigrants, with violating the constitution, with breaking the law.
Whatever may have been the reasons of the continual blame
which I received from him in regard to conduct in which I found
nothing to reproach myself with, I could not ascertain them,
and, persuaded that, from the moment that I lost his confidence,
I could expect no more good, I asked of you my dismissal
Happy would it have been if it had reached me prior to his 
departure! He would then have learnt that ambition never was
<pb id="beard104" n="104"/>
my master, and especially he would not have done me the injury
to publish that I desired to terminate my services to France by
a crime towards which I was drawn by the men around me who
were sold to the English.</p>
            <p>“Whoever those may have been of whom I was obliged to make
use to assist me in my important occupations, and without whom
even with all the means given by education which I have not 
received, I could not have performed my functions, I will one day
prove that no one less than myself merits the reproach laid at my
door by my adversaries, namely, that I allowed myself to be governed.</p>
            <p>“Could it be laid to my charge that I directed towards the
public interests, that I employed for the advantage of the 
republic, activity, talents, and genius? And when my secretaries,
whom bonds too sacred unite to their mother country to allow a
moment's doubt of their attachment to her, are the sole depositaries 
of my secrets, the sole confidants of the projects which
I could not confine within my own breast; why cast on men who
will never influence me the blame of the ridiculous intentions
imputed to me, and which never having entered my heart,
again prove that I do not allow myself to be governed by the
passions of others? If those passions had directed my steps, I
should not have foreseen the event which has just taken place,
and, walking like a blind man on my political course, I should
have asked you for my dismissal.</p>
            <p>“But that step which prudence forced me to take, the only one
which could dissipate the storm with which I was threatened,
was very far from restoring confidence in the minds of the
people of Saint Domingo. The discontent of the labourers had
increased by the compulsion of an engagement for three years.
That seemed to them a step back to slavery. They called to
mind the means proposed by Vaublanc to establish his system
in this colony, and they were surprised that when the Directory
had punished that conspirator, its Agent should propose the
same measures, should prescribe them, should exact their prompt
and full execution. This dissatisfaction which was fostered, was
soon shared by the soldiers. By the discharge of more than
three thousand men, effected after the evacuation of the west by
<pb id="beard105" n="105"/>
the English, I had proved how necessary I thought it to cut
down the armaments of the military. I was blamed in that
operation, and I received the order not to cut down any troop.
Nevertheless, on the departure of the English, it was declared
that all the black forces ought to be disbanded in order to be
sent back to agriculture, and that European soldiers only should
be employed in the defence of the coasts. Then distrust entered
the soldiers' hearts, and while previously a part of them had
taken the hoe without a murmur, they showed aversion toward a
measure which they regarded as an attack on liberty.</p>
            <p>“Whatever were the grounds of distrust with which I was 
surrounded; however faithful the councils I received on all parts
from the most sincere friends of the prosperity of Saint Domingo;
whatever fears were infused into my mind by the crimes 
contemplated against my person; I did not hesitate to set out for
the Cape, and even endeavoured to give a proof of my confidence
in the highest authorities, by going unattended, except by an
aide-de-camp and a cavalry officer; but having arrived on the
Héricourt plantation, I was met by alarming rumours. I learned
that at Fort-Dauphin, the fifth colonial regiment—which contributed 
so much to the restoration of order, to the purification of
La Grande Rivière, (the Vendée of Saint Domingo,) to the expulsion of the English—had become the victim of the European
troops, who formerly had delivered up to foreign powers the
points of the colony which had been confided to their defence.</p>
            <p>“Convinced, then, of the bad intentions of the Government
in whose names all those horrors were committed; no longer
seeing any security for any one who had acquired well-grounded
claims to the national gratitude; fearing, with good reason,
for my own life, I turned back and prepared to go and wait at
Gonaïves official news of an event, the consequences of which I
dreaded. I received a letter from the General Agent, which
confirmed my fears, and in which he ordered me to repair to
Fort-Dauphin to aid the citizen Manigat, whom he had
invested with all civil and military power, in the re-establishment 
of order and public tranquillity. I then pressed on to
Gonaïves, in order to take the escort, of which I had need. The
<pb id="beard106" n="106"/>
crimes committed by Frenchmen against my brethren, forced me
to this prudential measure. I left Gonaïves with the fourth
regiment; but what was my grief, when, on arriving at the
Héricourt plantation, I learned that the rising of the labourers
had become general, that all the plain was in arms, and
threatened Cape Town with an immediate irruption. Those who
with that design had assembled on the Héricourt estate, 
surrounded me as soon as I arrived, reproaching me with having
deceived them in answering for the good intentions of General
Hédouville, and attributed to me the slaughter of their brethren
at Fort-Dauphin, the arrest of some of them, and the dismissal of
General Moyse; and then it was that I received information of
all the details of that unfortunate event. Soon I learned that
the evil was intruding into all the parishes, and that the people
required that General Hédouville should be sent away, the
restoration of General Moyse to his rights, and the liberation of
the officers of the fifth regiment, made prisoners in the affair at
Fort-Dauphin, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>“Whatever pain I felt at the excesses committed against a corps,
respectable for its services, and against officers whom I knew
always attached to their duties, against a chief who never failed
in his attachment to France and to the principles of liberty—
my own nephew—I regarded in so alarming an event only the
imminent dangers to which the public interests were exposed.
I sent on all sides faithful emissaries to calm the agitated minds
of men; to announce to them my arrival, and to require of them
to do nothing without my orders. I hastened to set myself in
opposition to the enterprises of the more senseless, who had
already taken possession of the heights of the Cape and of Fort
Belair which commands the city. With difficulty could I make
my way through the crowds; an immense influx of people, whom
the blind desire for revenge had armed, covered all the roads
which led to the Cape, and threatened that city with the
greatest calamities. Frightened at the abyss, on the brink of
which the city stood, I ran to draw it back. In my course, I
learned that the General Agent had gone on board the fleet. 
Surprised at the news, I hastened to the Cape, which I reached
<pb id="beard107" n="107"/>
with difficulty, after having, sometimes by prayers, sometimes by
menaces, stopped the torrent with which it was threatened to be
inundated. The astonishment caused by the departure of
General Hédouville, was changed into grief when I learned that
that Agent, alarmed, doubtless, at the dangers to which he
had exposed the public weal, and despairing of any longer
being able to conserve it, had resolved to go away, and that, to
colour his pusillanimous flight, he had proclaimed that I was
aiming at independence.</p>
            <p>“The terror having augmented, more than eighteen hundred
persons followed the Agent in his flight. He ordered the
cannons to be spiked. The command was being executed, when
there arose a cry‘To arms!’ The troops drawn out in battle
array were moved by the cry; they were pacified by their
leaders; had a single musket been fired, the city would have
perished.</p>
            <p>“Strong in my conscience, I shall not remind you, citizen directors, 
of all I have done for the triumph of liberty, the prosperity
of Saint Domingo, the glory of the French Republic; nor will I
protest to you my attachment to our mother country, to my
duties; my respect to the constitution, to the laws of the
Republic, and my submission to the Government. I swear to
you I am faithful, and my future conduct, more than all oaths,
will prove to you that I shall always be faithful.</p>
            <p>“If the defence of my cause, that of the freedom of my brethren,
needed cunning and intrigue, and manly eloquence, in order to
triumph over my enemies, I would give it up and weep over
France; but as I am persuaded that it is sufficient to present
the truth for it to be apprehended by the republican Government, 
I am satisfied with setting before you an exposition of
my conduct, and of that of General Hédouville, and repose on
your justice for the verdict which is to result.</p>
            <p>“As soon as I had re-established the public tranquillity, I sent
to the Commissioner Roume—your delegate in what was formerly
the Spanish part of this island—to intreat him in the name of the
public safety to come and take the reins of government thrown
up by General Hédouville; persuaded that his determination will
<pb id="beard108" n="108"/>
be conformed to the wishes of all good Frenchmen, I impatiently
await his arrival, in order to aid him with all my power in the
important functions of his new position.”</p>
            <p>The appeal of justice and rectitude prevailed. The Directory
were satisfied with Toussaint's self-justification. More might
have been expected; more ought to have been given. But
suspicions began to prevail in France to the disadvantage of
the negro emancipator. The purer his conduct, the more
heroic his life, the greater was his crime, for his real crime was
his power, and that power was the natural and inevitable 
consequence of his virtuous and high-minded career.</p>

            <argument>
              <p>Civil war in the south between Toussaint L'Ouverture and Rigaud—Siege and capture of Jacmel.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN quitting the shores of Hayti, Hédouville threw a torch of 
discord amidst the excitable population. Not only did he cause
alarm by declaring that Toussaint was preparing to betray the
colony to the English, but he called forth the slumbering passions
of the men of colour, by intimating that with them lay the power
and the duty of traversing his treacherous designs. He even
addressed a letter to their leader, Rigaud, in which he formally set
that mulatto general free from his obligations to Toussaint as
Commander-in-chief, and requested him to assume the command
of the southern department. This was nothing less than an 
invitation to civil strife. A correspondence took place between
L'Ouverture and Rigaud. According to what he believed to be
his duty, the former acquainted the latter with the departure of
Hédouville, and exhorted him to pursue such a course as would
promote the general weal. Rigaud, evading the real point at
issue, brought into prominence the alleged partiality of Toussaint
toward the emigrants, whom he requested him to drive away.</p>
            <pb id="beard109" n="109"/>
            <p>The request, of course, remained without effect, but it served
as a pretext to the jealousies of Rigaud. Again did trouble
take possession of the popular mind. The fear became the
greater because Rigaud urged on Toussaint severity towards the
proprietors, whereas the latter had determined to pursue his
course of administering equal justice to men of all colours, so
long as they proved themselves good citizens. In this state of
excitement Toussaint L'Ouverture invited the Commissioner
Roume to repair to the seat of government, in order to fill the
post vacated by Hédouville. In this step he gave effect to a
decree of the Directory. Roume appeared at the Cape on the
12th of January, 1799. Toussaint, though suffering from sickness, 
repaired thither to confer with him a few days afterwards.
The two chief authorities in the island came to an amicable
understanding after mutual explanations. Entering into the
large and philanthropic views of L'Ouverture, Roume 
pronounced him “a philosopher, a legislator, a general, and a good
citizen.”</p>
            <p>Anxious to scatter the clouds which overhung the horizon,
Roume called together the chief captains of the island. In
order to excite attention to the conference and commemorate
the event, public festivities were celebrated. At the foot of the
tree of liberty, planted in the great square, and surrounded by
generals, Roume delivered a speech, in which he recommended
peace, union, love of the republic, and self-sacrifice. He 
pronounced eulogies on the army, extolling the success of its arms
against the enemies of France, and declared that the most perfect
union existed between the generals, Toussaint L'Ouverture,
Rigaud, Biassou, Laplume, and the other military chiefs. The
following day business was entered into in earnest. The 
representative of the French Government requested Rigaud to cede
certain portions of the territory which was under his control.
The request looked like a concession to Toussaint L'Ouverture.
Jealousy sprang into activity in Rigaud's mind. After a warm
discussion, and some time for reflection, the mulatto chief gave in
his resignation. Roume replied, urging its withdrawal. The
request prevailed, and Rigaud set out for the south. On his way
<pb id="beard110" n="110"/>
he evacuated Grand Goâve and Petit Goâve—a portion only of
what had been required—which L'Ouverture caused his troops to
occupy. The storm had receded; by no means had it passed
away. The colonists rallied around L'Ouverture; for they had
not forgotten that it was from the efforts of the free men of
colour to gain equality of political rights, that the revolution had
proceeded, which had changed the face of the island. They stirred
up divisions among the blacks and the men of mingled blood.
On their part the men of colour were displeased at seeing the
supreme command settled in the hands of an African of pure
blood, and flocked around the standard of Rigaud. The blacks,
under the protection of the Government and Toussaint, beheld
the gathering clouds not without excitement, yet in confidence;
nor were they unwilling, after so many victories, to try a last
fall with their special foe.</p>
            <p>The contest began with extremes; free white men fought with
black slaves. Its intervals have disappeared. The circle has
narrowed. Those who are nearest each other are about to join
in conflict. The black will fight with those who are a little
less black than himself: therefore this will be the deadliest combat
of all. The two parties stand and look at each other like 
inflamed beasts of prey. Which will make the first spring?</p>
            <p>The mulatto, to the qualities of pride and meanness, adds
singular strength of muscle and impulse of passion. Conscious
of power, he also feels within him boiling emotions. If victory
depended on a dash, he would be master wherever he dwells.
But the very exuberance of his nature precludes caution and
banishes prudence, and in the impetuosity of his rush he incurs
as much peril as he occasions. Impatient of delay, he pays
for momentary advantages by speedy and irretrievable defeat.
Yet the same unbridled will which brings disaster nourishes
vindictiveness; he is therefore ever prepared, if not panting,
for revenge. The fight, consequently, is renewed, but without a
change of result; and so life passes away in extravagant and
disappointed efforts.</p>
            <p>The mulattoes of Hayti could not restrain their wounded
feelings. The opposition to the Government broke out at
<pb id="beard111" n="111"/>
Corail, a small village in the southern department. The men of
colour gaining the upper hand, threw into prison, at Jéremie,
thirty of their prisoners, consisting of one colonist and nine-and-twenty 
blacks. Then was re-enacted the tragedy of the Black
Hole in Calcutta. The prisoners perished from bad air. 
Premeditation was imputed to the mulattoes; of culpable 
inconsideration and blind passion they were guilty. “In all movements,” remarked L'Ouverture, “the blacks are the victims.”
This dark event rendered the continuance of peace impossible.
Both sides prepared for war. Toussaint, with a foresight 
becoming his position, looked calmly at the probable wants of the
island in general. Hayti was indebted for the food of its 
inhabitants chiefly to importation. The condition of France gave
small hope of sufficient supplies. War, too, would suspend the
operations of agriculture in the island. He therefore negotiated
a commercial treaty with the United States.</p>
            <p>The conflict began with an attack by Rigaud's troops on
Petit Goâve, the surrender of which had been obtained in the
conference at the Cape. The place fell, and the colonists were
all ruthlessly massacred. Profiting by the success, Rigaud
advanced and took up a position against Grand Goâve. Hastening 
to Port-au-Prince, Toussaint justly accused Rigaud with
having first drawn the sword, and made preparations for the
campaign. Having called the mulattoes together into the
Church, he ascended the pulpit and laid bare their bosoms, 
foretelling his own success and the ruin of their cause. “I see,” he
said to them, “I see to the bottom of your souls; you are ready
to rise against me, but although all the troops are quitting the
west, I leave behind my eye and my arm—my eye, which will
watch you; my arm which, if necessary, will fall upon you.”</p>
            <p>A mulatto plot, which extended even to the north, had put the
keys of Port-au-Prince into the hands of a traitor. L'Ouverture
was a prisoner in a town which he thought his own. But his
decision and courage were equal to all crises. He discovered the
snare, punished the criminals, and then, with the fleetness and
the force of the eagle, flew back over his own territories, and,
forcing strongholds and capturing towns, went as far to the
<pb id="beard112" n="112"/>
north-west as Saint-Nicholas, which he brought back to its duty.
The men of colour were smitten with consternation, and many of
them having been captured in the several collisions, suffered 
indignities the most humiliating. Suddenly Toussaint returned to
the Cape. The guilty thought the hour of their doom was come.
The high-minded victor invited the inhabitants to meet him at the
church, and there, besides a concourse of people, all the civil and
military authorities assembled. The garrison, which consisted of
black troops, surrounded the place; and under the guard of a
picket of soldiers in the church were the men of colour, almost
naked, and in extreme dejection. Toussaint L'Ouverture ascended
an elevation, pronounced a eulogium on the forgiveness of 
injuries as the duty of every Christian, and then proclaiming the
pardon and the freedom of all the mulattoes, he distributed
clothes and money to them severally, and gave strict injunctions
that, on their way to join their families, they should be 
protected and treated as brothers. This unexpected generosity 
produced the most lively enthusiasm. As he left the church, 
benedictions were showered on his head.</p>
            <p>While at the Cape, admiration at Toussaint's clemency was
universal; the mulatto insurgents in the south only fought the
more strenuously, in order to make up by military advantage
that which L'Ouverture had gained by wise moderation. No wars
are so bitter or so bloody as those of class, caste, and colour.
The fact was illustrated in this terrible conflict. With such
bitterness and ferocity did it rage, that Toussaint was compelled
to employ all his influence to recruit his ranks. To the blacks
he might look with confidence, as the war was specially for their
benefit; but the blacks began to grow alarmed as the sanguinary
struggle proceeded. The whites in the north and the west, who
had hitherto been exempt from the service, were marshalled at
the Cape, and sent into the south, to take part in a contest in
which they had only a remote interest. A mute consternation
prevailed. Scarcely was the conflict spoken of in the intercourse
of private life, and the periodical press transcribed the reports
of the several chiefs without permitting themselves to add any
comments or reflections. Every one not actually engaged in the
<pb id="beard113" n="113"/>
warfare feared to compromise himself, lest he should bring on his
head the vengeance of the conqueror. Yet prudence did not
prevent complications of all kinds, nor could Toussaint's mercy
preclude horrors the most distressing. Rigaud, boundless in
resources as he was brave and daring, put forth all his energy,
and maintained his position at every cost. Toussaint, with a
prowess not inferior to Rigaud's, was equally vigilant, and equally
bold. Yet was he unable to guard against all stratagems. In
the recesses of the mountains near Port-de-Paix, as he made his
way with few attendants, he found that he had fallen into an
ambuscade. A discharge of musketry rattled around his head,
his physician fell dead at his feet. The plume of feathers which
he wore was shot away, and he himself escaped as if by miracle.
Saved from one, he shortly after was exposed to another ambuscade. 
The shots were directed at his carriage; the coachman
was killed; he himself rode tranquilly on horseback a few paces
distant. In the midst of perils, Toussaint L'Ouverture persevered. 
Yet he obtained only partial success. The troops of
Rigaud, if fewer in number, were individually superior to the
hasty levies of Toussaint, and collectively better disciplined.
Many of them had long fought under their chief, and were 
conversant with all the resources and requirements of the war in
which they were engaged. With the country in which the 
conflict was waged they were intimately acquainted, and of the
character of their leader they knew enough to be aware that only
defeat would bring discredit or occasion displeasure. Having to
overcome such an enemy, Toussaint L'Ouverture found it necessary 
to put forth his utmost power, the rather as he had to hold
possession of a wide extent of country, and that with troops of
whom the bulk were of an inferior caste. Painful is it to read
the alternations of defeat and victory in this terrible 
contest, especially as on both sides they were accompanied by acts
of cruelty. The only relief that the mind can obtain in going
through the now tedious, now revolting details, arises from the
reflection that had such amount of effort and such patience of
suffering as these events show man to possess, been employed,
as happily one day they may be employed, in some cause of high
<pb id="beard114" n="114"/>
benevolence, some undertaking to save and not to destroy men's
lives, the results would have been no less satisfactory than 
glorious indeed. The terror inspired by Rigaud's successes and
ferocity drove the labourers from the fields into the forts; from
the forts they were driven into the towns; when one town was
taken, they escaped into another. Then they assembled together
to concert and make attacks. Thus the country was a desert,
the cities overflowed. While agriculture was at a standstill,
provisions were often destroyed, and while no supplies came from
the country, the dense masses aggregated in the towns 
experienced want. The want arose to famine in Jacmel, lying on
the southern side of the tongue of land which forms the southern
department. Jacmel, on the seashore, formed the key of the
district. It was under the power of Rigaud, commanded by
Birot. Resolved to capture the place, which was capable of
affording an obstinate resistance, Toussaint himself sat down 
before it. With the utmost difficulty were the preparations for
the siege made. Women and children were employed to convey
ammunition. Bands, amounting to six thousand labourers, drew
huge pieces of cannon along frightful precipices, and down roads
the most rugged, broken, and dangerous. At length, the troops
were collected, and Jacmel was invested, so far as the sea would
permit. Soon the harbour also was blockaded. Then the terrors
of famine began to be experienced. So intense and various were
the sufferings, that the officers at length determined to capitulate. 
The determination was opposed by the soldiers, who 
declared resistance still possible. The commander, with two of his
staff, embarked in the night and escaped to Cayes. His post
was assumed by Gauthier. The siege was pressed with vigour.
Post after post was taken. Meanwhile, Rigaud neither came
up to aid, nor operated a diversion. Then Petion, apprized of
the critical position of the town, determined to assume the
perilous command, and, with three vessels and some provisions,
succeeded in making his way into the port, under the discharges
of firearms from the enemy's posts. Entering into the duties he
had voluntarily undertaken, he employed all his ability in the
defence. But an enemy was at work over whom he had no
<pb id="beard115" n="115"/>
power. The famine reached such a height, that the inhabitants
were compelled to eat the horses belonging to the cavalry.
Every green thing was torn up and devoured. Those thought
themselves happy who, in their search for food, met with a rat or a
lizard. In the public highways, famished men scarcely recognised
each other. Frenzy and wailing filled every place. Mothers,
worn down by want, fatigue, and woe, lay in the streets, with
their dead infants on their exhausted breasts. At length Petion,
seeing that further resistance was impossible, resolved to cut his
way through the besiegers. In order to inspire his soldiers
with his own courage, he tore the flags from the staffs, and
commanded his men to bind strips of them round their bodies,
so that if they perished, they might still be faithful to their
colours. Jacmel fell, and its fall was a heavy blow to Rigaud.
Having taken possession of Jacmel, Toussaint L'Ouverture 
addressed to the inhabitants of the southern department the 
following proclamation:—</p>
            <q type="letter" direct="unspecified">
              <text>
                <body>
                  <div1 type="letter">
                    <opener>“CITIZENS,</opener>
                    <p>“By what fatality is it, that hitherto deaf to my voice,
which invites you to order, you have listened only to the councils 
of Rigaud? How is it possible that the pride of a single
person should be the source of your evils, and that to flatter his
ambition, you are willing to destroy your families, ruin your
property, and bring yourselves into disgrace in the eyes of the
whole world.</p>
                    <p>“I repeat to you for the third and last time, that my quarrel
is not with the citizens of the south, but solely with Rigaud,
inasmuch as he is disobedient and insubordinate; whom I wish
to bring back to his duties that he may submit to the authority
of a chief whom he can no longer disown. You ought not to
have supported in his misdeeds a proud soldier who evidently
raised the standard of revolt. You ought to have left me free
to act, since I had a right to reprimand and even to punish
him. This Rigaud knew well, but, too haughty to bow before
the organs of the law, he has employed every means to seduce
you and to retain you as accomplices. Consult your conscience;
<pb id="beard116" n="116"/>
put away all prejudices; you will then easily know that Rigaud
has desired to drive into revolt all men of colour, in order to
make them his partisans and co-operators. I need not remind
you of the means he has taken for the purpose, and the resources
he has employed to deceive you all. You know as well as I,
perhaps better than I, his destructive projects, and all he has
attempted to put them into execution; he pretended to 
command blacks and whites without being willing to be commanded
by them. Yet the law is equal for all. Painful experience
ought to have torn from your eyes the veil which hides the brink
of the precipice. Give, then, close attention to what you are
about to do, and the danger which you still run. Reflect on
the perils and the calamities which threaten you, and hasten to
prevent them. I am kind, I am humane, I open to you my
fatherly arms. Come all of you, I will receive you all, no less
those of the south than those of the west and of the north, who,
gained over by Rigaud, have deserted your firesides, your wives,
your children, to place yourselves at his side. And Rigaud 
himself, that ambitious man, if he had followed the advice which I
gave him, to submit to his lawful superiors, would he not now be
tranquil and peaceful in the bosom of his family? would he not
be firm and untroubled in the command which was intrusted to
him? But mastered by deadly passions, Rigaud has dug a gulf
at your feet; he has laid snares which you could not avoid. He
wished to have you as partisans in his revolt; and to succeed in
his object, he has employed falsehood and seduction. If you
carefully examine this artful but very impolitic conduct, you
cannot but declare that Rigaud does not love his colour, and that
he had rather sacrifice it to his pride and ambition than labour
for its happiness by good example and wise councils. And in
truth, citizens, the greater number of those whom he has misled,
have perished either in battle or on the scaffold. Must not the
others who persist in this revolt expect a similar fate, if they 
abjure not their culpable error? You may be well assured that if
humanity did not direct the actions of a chief attached to his
country as well as to his fellow-citizens, and more disposed to
pardon than to punish, the calamity would be still greater; it 
<pb id="beard117" n="117"/>
belongs to you to prevent its augmentation. In consequence,
I invite you, citizens, to open your eyes and to give serious
attention to the future. Reflect on the disasters which may
ensue from longer obstinacy. Submit to lawful authority, if
you wish to preserve the south untouched. Save your families
and your property.</p>
                    <p>“But if, contrary to my expectation, you continue to
support the revolt raised and propagated by Rigaud, in vain
will you reckon on the fortifications he has constructed. The
army of Toussaint L'Ouverture, led by generals whose bravery
you know, will assail you, and you will be conquered. Then,
not without grief, and in spite of my efforts, shall I see that you
have been the unhappy victims of the pride and ambition of a
single man. I will say more; desiring to put an end to the evils
which have already too long afflicted this unfortunate colony, and
wishing to prove to the French nation that I have done everything 
for the safety and happiness of my fellow-citizens, if Rigaud
—though the author of these troubles—presents himself in good
faith, and without stratagem, and acknowledges his fault, I will
still receive him. But if Rigaud persists, and if he refuses to
profit by my offer—do you, fathers, mothers, families—do you
all come; I will receive you with open arms. The father of the
prodigal son received his child after he had repented.”</p>

            <p>This merciful invitation was not without effect on the
population of the south. Rigaud himself, however, had gone too
far to return. He was committed to the rebellion, and felt both
compelled and disposed to abide the result. In order to counteract 
the loss of Jacmel, and the appeal of Toussaint, he made
extraordinary exertions to raise in mass the population under
his sway. On his side, L'Ouverture prepared to prosecute his
advantages, and terminate the disastrous war.</p>

            <pb id="beard118" n="118"/>
            <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
            <argument>
              <p>Toussaint endeavours to suppress the slave-trade in Santo-Domingo, 
and thereby incurs the displeasure of Roume, the representative of France—he overcomes Rigaud—Bonaparte, now First Consul, sends Commissioners to the island—End of the war in the south.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BUT Toussaint L'Ouverture found troubles and hindrances in an
unexpected quarter. During the fratricidal war which deluged
the south with blood, the horrible traffic of the slave-trade was
revived on the east of the island. This commerce, originated by
Jean François and Biassou, continued after their disappearance
from the political scene, and went on constantly increasing.
Young blacks, stolen in the north, were conveyed to the City of
Saint Domingo, where they were shipped for Porto Rico and
Havannah—there to bear the yoke of slavery. Many of the
old officers of Jean François pursued this as their only means of
subsistence.</p>
            <p>Aware that representations had in vain been made against these
barbarities at the court of Madrid, and indignant that slavery,
when nearly extinguished in its old form, should be revived in
a new, and even worse one, Toussaint wrote (Dec. 25, 1800)
from the walls of Jacmel to the agent Roume, urging him, as the
only effectual means of putting a stop to the evil, to take possession 
of the Spanish part of the island, conformably to treaty. 
Under the pretext that it was necessary to await the arrival of some
European troops, Roume postponed the execution of the request.
Toussaint was too versed in politics not to be aware that the
ostensible postponement was, in reality, a refusal. He also
became aware that Roume's adviser was one who owed no good
will to himself. That person, being invited to give an account
of his conduct, emigrated to Porto Rico—justifying the suspicion
<pb id="beard119" n="119"/>
that he had interested motives for promoting the continuance of
the infamous traffic.</p>
            <p>This event, in which L'Ouverture appears to fresh advantage,
and acted in agreement with the general tenour of his public life,
occassioned an estrangement between him and Roume. The
agent had conceived the plan of conquering the English 
possessions in the West Indies. On an enterprise of such a nature
and magnitude, he ought to have consulted, and, if he were
willing, employed, the commander-in-chief. But, either to show
his independence of Toussaint L'Ouverture, or to put a public
insult on him, he passed by that general, and confided to 
Marshall Bese the command of an expedition against Jamaica. In
order to pave the way, he sent into the island two men of 
determined character, a white and a mulatto. Those emissaries
were denounced, taken, and hanged. The event interfered with
Toussaint's operations, for the English captured a flotilla which
he intended for the blockade of Jacmel. From this time, there
existed a rupture between Roume and Toussaint. Criminations
were exchanged. Each threw impediments in the way of the
other. Toussaint could not regard Roume as a sincere friend of
his race. Roume affected to believe that Toussaint had 
sympathies in favour of the English, with whom France was at
war. At last, Roume demanded a vessel to convey him to
France.</p>
            <p>As soon as Toussaint had become master of Jacmel, he 
proceeded to the Cape, and in an interview with the Agent,
reproached him, in the presence of his staff, with being an enemy
to the colony and to the liberty of the blacks. He further 
required him to give an order for the occupation of the east,—
resolved to put down the slave-trade, of which that was the
centre. Roume refused compliance. The consequence was, that
he apprehended the Agent, and sent him to prison. The 
expedient prevailed. The order was given. Toussaint despatched
General Agé to Santo Domingo, and returned to finish the war
in the south. A regular campaign was begun. The rebels were
defeated, and abandoned several posts the retention of which was
<pb id="beard120" n="120"/>
indispensable to their safety. Rigaud saw his star grow pale.
Most of his superior officers abandoned him. Desertion spread
through the ranks. On the other side, Toussaint appeared amid
his troops, radiant with victory. He brought with him 
pecuniary resources. With these, he distributed pay among the
soldiers; and so, while supplying their wants, gained their 
confidence, and excited their enthusiasm.</p>
            <p>The two armies sat down opposite each other. Skirmishing
began. Then serious rencontres took place. At last, issue was
joined, and the revolters suffered a signal defeat. After this trial
of strength, Rigaud might be troublesome, but he could not be
formidable. Driven to desperation by his failures, he ordered
his men to lay waste the country, and, to use his own words,
to take such steps that “the trees should have their roots
in the air.” His old hands, thinned by war, sickness, and age,
became Rigaud's sole reliance. On every side his cause was
abandoned by the citizens and the civic authorities. Thus
was he reduced to a leader of banditti. He saw his position,
and issued this proclamation,—it was his last word to the
public:—</p>
            <p>“Considering the crisis in which the department is, owing to
the unjust and inhuman war carried on against it by the traitor
Toussaint L'Ouverture, from whom no one must expect either
safety or honour, I am obliged, in the position I hold, to take
the only measures that remain to save the department: 
considering, moreover, that proposals for peace, or for suspension 
of arms, directly concern the executive power, and that, in
all cases, it is to the chief of the armed force of the department
that the right belongs of proposing peace or suspending arms,
because he ought to seize the moment favourable for proposals
of the kind, which, if made in critical junctures, and by those
who have not the means of putting a stop to the evil, may
imbolden the enemy, and cause calamities he would have
avoided.</p>
            <p>“For now a year this war has been going on; the popular
bodies and the pretended friends of peace have taken no step
<pb id="beard121" n="121"/>
to stop its course. At the present, when the enemy has had
some success, and when terror has taken possession of feeble and
timid minds, they fancy that a monster thirsting for human
blood, an ungrateful wretch, a traitor towards the Republic, his
benefactor, the devastator of Saint-Domingo, the executioner of
the parish of Jacmel, the persecutor of all the French agents—
finally, the slave of the English, that he only can grant a peace
or a suspension of arms. Citizens of the southern department,
undeceive yourselves, if you think that anything else than arms
can save you, while you wait for the intervention of the French
Government, to whom those differences between the south and
the other departments have been referred. Be well assured,
my fellow-citizens, that I have your tranquillity and your 
happiness too much at heart, not to seize all opportunities to
procure for you peace or a suspension of arms; and if the enemy
adhere not to the proposals which in proper time and place
I shall think it my duty to make to him, I shall know how
with the aid of my brave comrades, to make war on him even
to extinction. Resume your courage. If he is powerful in
numbers and in resources, your fellow-citizens, composing the
southern army, possess courage and honour, and will find means
to secure your safety.</p>
            <p>“Under these circumstances, and employing the powers 
confided to me, I make these provisional arrangements, which are
to be punctually executed; and accordingly ordain:—</p>
            <p>“Article 1. The municipal government of the south shall
for the future restrict themselves to the simple but useful
functions of verifying births, marriages, and deaths; but all
municipal deliberations, all assemblies, as well as deputations to
the enemy, are interdicted. The municipalities shall only lay
before me the wishes of their fellow-citizens, to which I will give
replies.</p>
            <p>“Article 2. Parochial assemblies may take place after 
permission has been obtained from the Commander of the southern
department.</p>
            <p>“Article 3. Before legal permission is given, if there are
<pb id="beard122" n="122"/>
meetings, whether of individuals or of parishes, in the cities or
in the country, martial law shall be forthwith proclaimed, and
the chief of the armed force of the district is authorized to put
his troops in movement to put down the said meetings; he
shall begin with mild measures, and then employ severity, if he
is forced to it.</p>
            <p>“Article 4. The greatest vigilance shall be observed towards
the disturbers of the public peace, and against secret 
disorganizers: the proprietors shall be protected, and their 
property shall be respected. The national armed police shall be
in permanent activity in the interior, and those who shall be
denounced for any crime against order and safety, shall be
apprehended and tried by a council of war, and punished 
according to the laws.”</p>
            <p>This manifesto, the spirit of which is even worse than its
logic and its grammar, served only to show how undone Rigaud
was, and how necessary that all who had any regard to themselves
or the public good should abandon the desperate gladiator. His
bands, however, were unwilling to yield. Blood, therefore, flowed
in streams. The old men of the South are said still to shudder
when they think of that conflict, which they designate “the war
of the knife,” thus showing to what extreme means the 
combatants resorted in their deadly hatred and murderous strife.
The proclamation was scarcely anything more than the 
half-articulate words of a man who was staggering to his fall. Two
more serious conflicts tried, and lost, and Rigaud's star went
down below the horizon.</p>
            <p>While, during the weeks and months of a long year, these
frightful scenes of mutual carnage had been covering one of the
finest parts of Hayti with corpses and ruins, the Directory in
the mother country, too much occupied with its own divisions
and party interests, gave no attention to the distracted colony.
A change was at hand. Bonaparte, hastening from Egypt,
overturned the Directory, and snatched the reins of power.
Having taken his seat, he called around him (Dec. 2, 1799)
those who were thought to be conversant with the condition of
the colony, in order to discuss the means of restoring peace
<pb id="beard123" n="123"/>
within its borders. The representatives of Toussaint and of 
Rigaud were alike heard. Shortly after, a decree was issued, 
by which Vincent, Raymond, and Michel, were deputed to 
Hayti, in order to carry thither the Consular Constitution, 
and a proclamation addressed to the inhabitants. Rigaud was 
recalled to France. Toussaint L'Ouverture was confirmed in his 
post as General-in-chief.</p>
            <p>The proclamation was far from inspiring confidence or 
promoting tranquillity among the blacks, since it postponed and 
deferred to another legislative act the promulgation of the laws 
which were to govern Hayti. Michel, dissatisfied with the 
bravery of Toussaint L'Ouverture, returned into France. 
Raymond, whose mulatto's skin made him an object of suspicion, was 
ordered to remain at the Cape. Vincent alone was received with 
confidence. He presented to the Commander-in-chief the new 
Constitution, a letter written from the Minister of Marine, and 
the proclamation of the Consuls. In the proclamation were 
these words:—“Brave blacks, remember that the French 
Republic has given you liberty, and that it only can cause that
liberty to be respected.” These words, it was ordered, should 
be inscribed in letters of gold on all the flags of the colonial 
national guard. Toussaint manifested no haste either to publish 
the proclamation or embroider the sentence on the colours. 
How could he promulgate a known falsehood? The Republic 
had not given freedom to the blacks. The blacks, under their 
able leader, had extorted freedom from the hands of their masters. 
Toussaint, who was well informed of the views and intrigues 
regarding the colony which were nourished in Paris, knew that 
his ruin had been resolved on before the self-elevation of 
Bonaparte to the Consulship. Had the ill-feeling passed away? 
Why, then, had not the First Consul written to him under 
his own signature? Distrust and disquietude prevailed in the
relations of L'Ouverture and the representatives of the new
government in France. It is true that Rigaud was disowned, 
but Toussaint was not cordially embraced; nor were the rights 
of the blacks frankly recognised and legally settled.</p>
            <p>As soon as he had given audience to Vincent, Toussaint
<pb id="beard124" n="124"/>
L'Ouverture set off for the seat of the not yet wholly terminated
war. After a few days, he sent for Vincent, in order that the
chief civil and military powers should be on the spot. In the
hope of bringing the business to an amicable termination, the
General induced Vincent, accompanied by a black man and a
man of colour, to go on a deputation to the revolters, who yet
stood out. He put into the hands of the deputies an act of
amnesty in favour of all who had taken part in the war, not
even Rigaud excepted. The deputies reached Cayes, where
Rigaud held his head-quarters. That city, exhausted by so
long and so disastrous a conflict, heard with pleasure of the
object of their mission. Rigaud was quickly informed of the
arrival of the deputies. On reading the despatch he flew into
the most violent passion. The outburst was so violent as to
endanger Vincent's life. That agent, however, was the bearer
of a letter from Rigaud's son, to whom he had shown the kindest
attentions, and who declared to his father the gratitude he felt
in return. The mulatto chief eagerly threw his eyes over the
lines. All at once his wrath ceased. But the warrior soon
overcame the father. Vexation took the place of vengeance.
He would not live; he could not endure to live. Again and
again he tried to kill himself. At length he was calmed down,
and ere many days he quitted Saint Domingo for the shores of
France. Thither he was accompanied by Petion and some of
his principal officers. The other mulatto chiefs emigrated to
various parts of the archipelago of the Antilles.</p>
            <p>Thus terminated the war in the South. With that war every
obstacle to the freedom of the blacks disappeared. One after
the other had hindrances and opposition been swept out of the
way by the strong hand of Toussaint L'Ouverture, the 
negro-champion of the negro race. Against the colonists, against the
Spaniards, against the English, against the mulattoes, against
the French representatives, and in a measure against blacks
themselves, had he, by prudence, perseverance, and prowess,
by singleness of aim, by unity of purpose, by personal efforts
the most astounding, and a union of skill, caution, and daring
<pb id="beard125" n="125"/>
rarely equalled, vindicated the freedom of the Africans, in
Hayti. There was yet a stronger power. Religion, in its
relation to the grand work he had undertaken, rose in his
breast to enthusiasm. In some sense he was, he believed, God's
envoy and God's agent in the fierce and sanguinary struggle. In
that conviction he found light and strength which had, to him,
the vividness and the authority of what, in a qualified sense, may
be called inspiration. Here was the grand secret of his success.
He has himself given an outline of his career, which may 
appropriately find insertion in this place. “At the beginning of the
troubles of Saint Domingo, I felt that I was destined to great
things. When I received this Divine intimation I was four and
fifty years of age; I could neither read nor write; I had some
Portuguese coins; I gave them to a subaltern of the regiment of
the Cape, and, thanks to him, in a few months I could sign my
name and read with ease. The revolution of Saint Domingo was
taking its course. I saw that the whites could not endure,
because they were divided and because they were overpowered
by numbers; I congratulated myself that I was a black man.
A necessity was laid on me to commence my career. I went
over to the Spanish side, where the first troops of my colour had
found an asylum and protection. That asylum and protection
ended in nothing. I was delighted to see Jean François make
himself a Spaniard when the powerful French Republic 
proclaimed the general freedom of the blacks. A secret voice said
to me,‘Since the blacks are free, they need a chief, and it is I
who must be that chief, foretold by the Abbé Raynal.’ Under
this feeling I joyously returned to the service of France. France
and the voice of God have not deceived me.” These words are
reported from memory. As depending on the ear and the
tongue, they must be received only in their general tenour. Our
narrative, which rests on satisfactory vouchers, shows that, long
prior to the age of fifty-four, Toussaint could at least read. If
taken as indicating the defectiveness of his scholarship even at
the time when he began his task, they are, doubtless, substantially 
correct; and their testimony goes to confirm the 
<pb id="beard126" n="126"/>
unquestionable fact, that not by ordinary human appliances and aids
did this extraordinary genius accomplish his meritorious and
noble work.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref12" n="12" rend="sc" target="note12">*</ref></p>
            <note id="note12" n="12" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref12">* The instruction which Toussaint received in boyhood is testified by his son
Isaac, in his interesting Notes to the Memoirs he wrote, “<foreign lang="fre">Sur I'Expédition des
Français sous le Consulat de Bonaparte,</foreign>” appended to Metral's <foreign lang="fre">Histoire de
I'Expédition des Français à Saint Domingue,</foreign>” Paris, 1825. According to Isaac's
testimony, Toussaint when a boy learnt something of Latin and Geometry
(p.326). While yet he was in the service of Spain, Isaac says of him:—“Without
having topographical maps of those countries, after the example of captains of
the ancient world, Lucullus, Pompey, Cæsar, Toussaint made one; he laid down
on paper, according to information given him by people who knew the districts,
their extent, their respective distances, the direction of the mountains, and of the
rivers, and everything remarkable, such as defiles, &amp;c.,&amp;c.” (p. 329). The skill
to form such a map, besides involving reading and writing, gives countenance
to the intimation of Isaac Toussaint, that his father had some acquaintance with
geometry as well as drawing. Doubtless, the father's scholarship was always
quite rudimental.</note>

            </argument>
            <p>ON the first of August, 1800, L'Ouverture made his triumphal
entrance into Cayes. All official honours were rendered to him.
Hearts on every side beat with enthusiastic gratitude towards
the general benefactor. He ascended the pulpit and 
proclaimed the oblivion of wrongs. He complained only of the
absence of the mulattoes. The sense of their discomfiture was
too recent. Two of their chiefs, however, went to meet him
afterwards, and he received them in a cordial manner. His aim
<pb id="beard127" n="127"/>
was to direct men's minds from the dark past to the bright
future. On the 17th of the month he put forth his proclamation.</p>
            <p>“Citizens,—All the events which have taken place at Saint
Domingo during the civil war occasioned by Rigaud are of a
nature to merit public attention.</p>
            <p>“Now that they are no longer likely to be renewed, it is of
importance to the prosperity of the colony, and to the happiness
of the inhabitants, to draw the curtain on the past, in order that
we may be occupied exclusively in repairing the evils which, of
necessity, have resulted from the intestine war brought forth by
the pride and ambition of an individual.</p>
            <p>“A part of the citizens of Saint Domingo have been deceived,
because, too credulous, they did not sufficiently suspect the
snares which had been laid to draw them into their criminal
designs. Others have acted in these circumstances according to
the impulsion of their hearts. Moved by the same principles as
the chief of the revolt, they considered it beneath them to be
commanded by a black man. Him they judged it necessary to
get rid of, at whatever cost, and they spared nothing to succeed
in their object. The ambition of their chief led him to make
the country his own. His satellites had at heart nothing so
much as to give him aid. For their reward he assigned to them
aforehand the offices they were to occupy. They are disappointed
in their expectation; and in my quality as the victor, wishing
and very ardently desiring to promote the happiness of my
native land, penetrated by what is set forth in the Lord's Prayer,
‘Forgive us our transgressions as we forgive those who transgress
against us,’ I have published a proclamation by which I grant a
general amnesty. That proclamation is known to you. It has
produced the happy result which I promised myself. The
southern department has returned to its obedience to the laws.
Let us forget that bad men had led it away from duty to gratify
their criminal passions, and let us now consider only as brothers
those who, through their easy faith, dared to turn their arms
against the flag of the Republic, and against their lawful chief.
I have ordered all citizens to return to their several parishes to
enjoy the benefits of this amnesty. Citizens, not less generous
<pb id="beard128" n="128"/>
than myself, let your most precious moments be employed in
causing the past to be forgotten; let all my fellow-citizens swear
never to recall the past, let them receive their misled brethren
with open arms; and let them in future be on their guard
against the traps of bad men.</p>
            <p>“Civil and military authorities, my task is accomplished. It
now belongs to you to see that harmony is no more troubled.
Do not allow the least reproach on the part of any one against
those who went astray but have returned to their duty. 
Notwithstanding my proclamation, keep an eye on the bad and do not
spare them. The man is unjust, he is inclined to evil rather
than good. Firmly put down his perverse designs, and never
close your eyes on his conduct and his proceedings. Honour
should guide you all. The interests of our country require it;
its prosperity needs peace, true and confiding peace. Such a
peace must be your work. On you solely now depends public
tranquillity in Saint Domingo. Take no rest until you have
secured it. I expect this from your courage and from your
devotion to the French Republic.”</p>
            <p>The spirit of moderation, the spirit of mercy itself dictated
these words. Reference to the late troubles was prescribed by a
rigid sense of duty. The reference made in no way exceeds
what the occasion demanded, and falls very short of what the
evil inflicted by the revolt would have justified. It was of 
absolute necessity to characterize Rigaud. But how different the
tone of Toussaint L'Ouverture compared with the injurious
epithets lavished in his proclamation by that mulatto leader
against his lawful chief! But even for the bad L'Ouverture had
forgiveness. How terrible a punishment might he now have 
inflicted on the men of colour! Had he been open to the prejudices 
of caste and skin, he would have let loose on them the
desire of retribution and the thirst for revenge. One word of
his, and the race would have been nearly extirpated. Not by
their forbearance was he kept from uttering that word; nor by
their softened feelings towards the negroes; nor by a confidence
that they would no more attempt disturbance; but solely by a
<pb id="beard129" n="129"/>
regard to his religious duty, and a manly confidence in the right
and the merciful.</p>
            <p>“My task is accomplished.” And yet he had obtained
nothing for himself. The military position he held, as it was
won by the sword, so was it necessary to the work he had 
performed. It was a burden rather than a recompence—a duty
and an obligation instead of an honour. Not for himself, but
for his country, did he hold the command of the armies of Saint
Domingo. “My task is accomplished.” It <hi rend="italics">is,</hi> noble black: it <hi rend="italics">is</hi>
accomplished, and accomplished well, if only thou lookest to the
weal of Hayti. But hast thou no object of thine own? Opposition
can no longer hold up its head. Thy foes are prostrate. Every
eye is turned to thee. Every heart is fixed on thee. Hast thou
nothing to ask for thyself? The crown and sceptre of Hayti?
Nay, frown not. Other successful warriors have taken regal
titles as their due. Nor need thou fear opposition. The
Agent is weak and disesteemed. Bonaparte is reaping laurels in
Italy. England will be prompt to aid thee. Then consider how
much thy race needs elevation. What could so much raise them
from the dust? Yes, thou must, as thou canst, be King of
Hayti; and thy name, glorious for its military deeds, will be
more glorious still as the first of a long line of illustrious
sovereigns of negro blood.</p>
            <p>Instead of troubling himself and others in arrangements for
placing on his head the bauble of a crown, Toussaint L'Ouverture 
turned his attention to the condition of the country.
Hayti was not yet wholly in the power of France. Though
formally ceded to the French, the eastern part of the isle
remained under Spanish rule. Not sincere in his wishes to take
possession of Spanish Hayti, Roume had sent forces so 
inconsiderable, that they were easily defeated. On their return, he
revoked his order for its occupation. On learning the fact,
L'Ouverture was indignant. Was slavery, then, in its worst
form, to be established and acknowledged in Hayti? Was the
Government to be an assenting, if not a concurring, party?
And were all his own labours and sacrifices to be thus 
frustrated? Frustrated by low self-interest and base intrigues?
<pb id="beard130" n="130"/>
Could he, who had conquered freedom for the negroes, allow
their children to be kidnapped and transported to strange
countries and foreign lands, there to be degraded and rained?
Impossible! Yet such was the alternative, if Roume retained
possession of the civil government: for he had tried what could
be done in this matter with Roume by argument and moral
influence. The effort had failed, and now Roume had availed
himself of his absence, and his absorption in military duties, to
reverse a policy in which they had in council come to an 
understanding. Besides, he had proved himself unfaithful to France,
by virtually surrendering a portion of his rightful possessions.
In such hands, power could not be safely trusted. And, doubtless, 
the home government would thank him if Toussaint 
vindicated its rights and secured its territory.</p>
            <p>Actuated by those considerations, Toussaint L'Ouverture
arrested Roume, and sent him to Dondon. On the occasion, he
issued this address:—</p>
            <q type="letter" direct="unspecified">
              <text>
                <body>

                    <opener>“Toussaint L'Ouverture, General-in-Chief of his 
fellow-citizens.</opener>
                    <p>“The duties of the office held by Citizen Roume were, in his
quality of representative of the French Government, to 
consecrate his moral and physical faculties to the happiness of Saint
Domingo and to its prosperity. Very far from doing so, he
took council only of the intriguers by whom he was surrounded,
to sow discord amongst us, and to foment the troubles which
have not ceased to agitate society. However, in spite of the
calumnies which he has continually thrown out against myself
in his letters to France and Santo Domingo, he shall be 
protected from every penalty. But my respect for his character
must not prevent me from taking the proper steps in order to
deprive him of the power of again plotting against the 
tranquillity which, after so many revolutionary concussions, I have
just had the happiness to establish. In consequence, and in
order to isolate him from the intriguers who have kept him in
their shackles, and to respond to the complaints made in respect
to him by all the parishes, the brigadier-general Moyse will
<pb id="beard131" n="131"/>
supply the said Citizen Roume with two carriages and a sure
escort, which, with all respect due to his character, will conduct
him to the village of Dondon, where he will remain until the
French Government shall recall him to render an account of
his administration.</p>

            <p>Roume remained a prisoner at Dondon for several months,
and then was permitted by L'Ouverture to return to France by
way of the United States.</p>
            <p>As soon as he had removed the impediment, Toussaint
L'Ouverture took effectual steps for putting down the 
slave-trade, and occupying the east of the island. After a few shots,
he entered Santo Domingo on the 2nd of January, 1801, at the
head of 10,000 men, and hoisted the flag of the French Republic
on its ramparts to the salvo of two-and-twenty cannon. He was
received at the mansion-house by the chief authorities, who
wished him to take, in the name of the Holy Trinity, an oath
to govern with wisdom. “Such a course would be proper,” he
replied, “in an officer appointed by the court of Madrid; but
I am  the servant of the Republic. Therefore, I am unable to
do what you ask; but I swear solemnly before God, who hears
the oath, that I forget the past, and that my watchings and my
cares shall have no other object than to render the Spaniards,
now become Frenchmen, contented and happy.” On the
utterance of these words, Don Garcia, the governor, handed him
the keys of the city. “I accept them,” said Toussaint, “in
the name of the French Republic;” and then turning towards
the assembly, he added, with an humble voice, “let us go and
thank the Author of all things for having crowned with the
greatest success our enterprise, prescribed by treaties and the
laws of the Republic.” Followed by the governor and all the
Spanish authorities, he went to the cathedral, where a <hi rend="italics">Te Deum</hi>
was chanted in token of gratitude to God.</p>
            <p>Thus, from Cape Samana in the east, to Cape Tiburon in the
<pb id="beard132" n="132"/>
west, the power of Toussaint L'Ouverture was everywhere
established and acknowledged. Knowing the favourable effects
produced on the popular mind by the progress of distinguished
personages in the parts under their administration, Toussaint
L'Ouverture traversed the Spanish territory, and visited the
principal places. He was everywhere received with the 
acclamations of the people, the merry peal of bells, and the thunders
of cannon. The clergy, bare-footed, came on all sides to give
him welcome. He treated them with profound respect. Within
a few days he was master of the obedience of the Spaniards as
much as of the confidence of the blacks.</p>
            <p>The union of the Spanish to the French part of Hayti 
procured reciprocal advantages, the effects of which soon became
apparent. The French gained facility in acquiring horses and
mules for the cultivation of the soil, and the Spaniards found
enormous gain in the exportation of its animals, flocks, and
horned cattle. The black regiments, restrained by Toussaint's
powerful hand, had done but little damage in the invasion;
and those who were left in garrison put large sums of money
in circulation. The elements of French administration which
followed the troops bestowed on the country new principles and
sources of industry and wealth. Magnificent roads were formed.
Carriages were then for the first time introduced. Even the
horses, under the influence of Toussaint's example, improved
their pace. Distances were abridged; time was saved; the
minds of the people were awakened from torpor; activity
universally prevailed, and commerce and riches began to abound.
Amid the general excitement, prosperity, and hope, the 
enthusiasm towards its cause became greater every day, and 
Toussaint's name was pronounced with blessings by all tongues.</p>
            <p>Having given the command of Santo Domingo to his brother
Paul, who had risen by merit to the rank of brigadier-general,
Toussaint L'Ouverture returned to the French part of Hayti,
and forthwith applied his mind to the condition and wants of
the island.</p>
            <p>He was thoroughly acquainted with the theatre on which he
had to act, and the character of the people subject to his
<pb id="beard133" n="133"/>
power. He took the wisest measures to <sic corr="develop">develope</sic> the powers of
the former, and to gain the confidence of the latter. Aware
that he had a mass of prejudices to overcome, and the most
tangled web of interests to set in order, he mingled discretion
with zeal; and while aiming at the general weal, forgot not the
deference that might conciliate, nor failed in the bland and
courteous manners that might win. The old colonists he 
welcomed to his presence without familiarity, and showed respect
even to their prejudices, so far as the public good would permit.
The steward of the plantation on which he had himself been a
slave, vegetated in the United States. L'Ouverture being
informed of the fact, wrote him an invitation to return to
Hayti, to put himself “at the head of the interests of their good
old masters.” The letter, conceived in a friendly and urgent
tone, brought back the steward. Toussaint gave him an interview, 
and among other things said to him, “Return to the
plantation; be just and inflexible; see that the blacks do their
duty in order to add, by your prosperity, to the prosperity of
the land.”</p>
            <p>The discontinuance of the war led to the resumption of 
agriculture. The change from the musket to the hoe was of course
gradual; but such was the influence and such the determination
of the great black, that ere long the rich cultivable districts
began to put on a smiling aspect, promising riches as well as
abundance. Had the peace continued, the promise would have
been realized in the fullest degree. Forthwith, however, did
the culture of the soil, besides providing for the wants of the
inhabitants, furnish the public treasury with sufficient resources.
Intelligence of the returning prosperity reached foreign lands.
The colonists who were scattered up and down in those lands
saw a ray of hope, and, notwithstanding what they had undergone 
in Saint Domingo, notwithstanding their dislike of the
predominance of the blacks, they invited and gladly accepted
permission to return home and resume possession of their
estates. Their letters coming from various countries, and
unanimously expressing confidence in the integrity and the power
of the General-in-Chief, as well as in the justice and excellence
<pb id="beard134" n="134"/>
of his administration, greatly contributed to strengthen his 
hands and confirm his authority. Scarcely could a more 
satisfactory or a more striking proof be given of the claim of 
Toussaint to our respect and admiration than is found in the 
readiness with which this class of men embarked their all in 
the vessel which he commanded. </p>
            <p>The political evils and civil wars that had afflicted Saint 
Domingo, in causing the expatriation of proprietors, had in many 
cases occasioned the loss of traces to the succession. Under 
Toussaint's orders, the property so circumstanced was secured to 
military chiefs, and was thus restored to cultivation and productiveness. 
At the same time, regulations were issued by which the
labourers on the estates became a sort of co-proprietors. He 
had, aforetime, thrown his protection over emigrants, and thereby 
had brought on himself difficulty and suspicion. He now took 
into his service subaltern officers of emigrant regiments, and 
offered protection to those who were unwilling to join his forces. 
Disregarding colour and position in his appointments, he sought 
in his servants and fellow-labourers for those who were most 
fitted for the duties of the several offices. If his favour was less 
marked toward any, it was toward those of his own blood; not 
because he loved them less, but because, having their confidence, 
he could employ in relation to them a freedom of word and 
action which might have been misunderstood by others. With 
his strong and vivid religious sentiments, he was naturally
prompted to pay special regard to the priests, and to the 
interests of religion in general. Nor, environed as he was by 
men whose senses were the avenues to their affections, did he 
neglect personal appearance. Studious in his attire, he 
surrounded himself with a numerous guard, in which were names 
distinguished in the olden time. When he went forth in public 
he was accompanied by a splendid retinue which fixed and 
dazzled all eyes. Surrounded by a guard of from fifteen to 
eighteen hundred men, brilliantly clad, and having for his own 
personal use a stud containing hundreds of horses, he appeared 
before the eyes of the people in the exterior of a prince. But,
beneath this imposing show, he himself studied the utmost 
<pb id="beard135" n="135"/>
simplicity. Always temperate, he often carried moderation to 
abstinence. His iron frame received strength chiefly from the deep 
and full resources of his vigorous mind. Master of his soul, he 
had no difficulty in mastering his body. While partaking of 
none but the most frugal diet, with water for his drink, and 
vegetable preparations for his meat, he rarely slept more than two 
hours. The whole energy of his life was absorbed and consumed 
in the great task which he had undertaken, and which, in truth, 
demanded more vital power than even he had to bestow. Though 
advanced in life, he was incessantly in movement, and travelled 
with a rapidity which defied calculation and excited amazement. 
Seeing everything with his own eyes, he had little need to rely 
on the reports of others, and he at once promoted his independence 
and augmented his power by deriving his policy and his
plans from his own knowledge, and his own meditations. Little
should we expect to see such a person addicted to the labours of
the cabinet. Yet in replying, by means of several secretaries, to
two or three hundred letters daily, he seemed to experience a
pleasure as lively as that enjoyed by other men in the satisfaction
of the senses.</p>
            <p>As the governor of the land, Toussaint L'Ouverture felt it
necessary to keep up some kind of state. Like other chief magistrates,
he had his receptions of ceremony, as well as his less formal
audiences. The union of French vanity and negro love of 
parade in the foremost people, made him feel the importance of 
requiring due attention to appearances and etiquette. Hence 
he instituted what bears the name of “circles,” at which all who 
were invited were expected to be present. These circles were of 
two kinds, the greater and the less. To the greater, formal 
invitations were given. Toussaint himself appeared in the 
assemblies in the undress uniform of a general officer. His 
simple attire, in the midst of surrounding brilliancy, contrasted 
favourably with the dignified tone which he knew how to
maintain. When he presented himself, all the company, females as
well as males, arose from their seats. Attentive even to the
proprieties, he showed his disapproval of any exposure of the person
in female dress. On one occasion, he was seen to throw
<pb id="beard136" n="136"/>
his handkerchief over the bare bosom of a lady, saying—“Modesty
is the best charm of the sex.” After having made the tour of
the hall, and spoken to everybody, he withdrew by the door at
which he entered, bowing right and left to the company. The
less circles were public audiences, which took place every
evening. At these, Toussaint L'Ouverture appeared clad like
the ancient proprietors when on their plantations. All the
citizens entered the grand saloon, and were, irrespectively of
rank and position, addressed by the governor as convenience
served. After having gone round the room, he retired, and
took with him into a small apartment in front of his 
bedchamber, which he used as a study, the persons with whom he
wished to converse more freely and more at length. The greater
number of these were the chief whites of the colony. There
seating himself, he requested all others to be seated. Then he
proceeded to talk with them of France, of his children, of religion,
of his old masters, and of God's grace in giving him liberty and
granting him means for discharging the duties of the post in
which he had been placed by the mother country. He also
conversed of the progress of agriculture, of commerce, and never
of political concerns: he questioned each respecting his own
private affairs, and of his family, and appeared to take an interest
in the several matters. With mothers, he spoke of their children,
and inquired whether they attended to their religious education;
and the young he would sometimes briefly examine in their
catechism. When he wished to put an end to the audience, he
arose, and bowed. The company then retired, being attended
by him to the door. As they left, he appointed times for
special interviews with those who made the request. Then he
shut himself up with his private secretaries, and commonly 
continued his labours far into the night.</p>
            <p>In this practical regard to show and parade, L'Ouverture
may have been influenced by his own personal defects. Small
in person, he was of a repulsive aspect, and having a difficult
utterance, he spoke with as little elegance as grammar. Yet,
his were words of power, for they came from a strong soul, and
were the heralds of a resolute will. A man of few words, and
<pb id="beard137" n="137"/>
powerful imagination, he sometimes uttered his ideas in parables
—the rather that in such a form he could the more effectually
imprint them on the minds of the rude natures with which he
had to deal. On more occasions than one, he took a glass vase,
and, having filled it with grains of black maize, he put therein
some grains of white maize, and said—“You are the black maize;
the whites, who would enslave you, are the white maize.” He
then shook the glass, and, placing it before their eyes, he cried, as
if inspired, “See the white ones only here and there.”</p>
            <p>The army, Toussaint L'Ouverture kept under the most vigorous
discipline. Every breach of duty was severely punished. Even
during the civil wars, plunder was restricted as much as possible.
He was, however, adored by his soldiers.</p>
            <p>Scarcely less was the veneration paid him by other members
of Haytian life. He won and enjoyed the esteem of the colonists;
he was valued highly by the ministers of religion; by the blacks
he was regarded as a messenger of God. Even the mulattoes
began to look to him with hope and respect.</p>
            <p>The confidence which Toussaint inspired, soon produced good
effects in the colony. The lands once more cultivated, and 
cultivated under judicious regulations, became productive, and, as of
old, poured forth abundance and wealth. With the spread of
industry and the increase of riches, population, which had been
greatly diminished in the wars, recovered its impulse and 
augmented its numbers. A large and prosperous people restored
the churches, which had been burnt or allowed to become dilapidated, 
decorated the cities with fine buildings, enriched the
public treasury, cultivated the arts, and, ere long, indulged in
luxury. The general intelligence was raised, and manners were
refined. Human nature vindicated itself against its calumniators: 
for in a short time, after a period of frightful wasting, the
black state of Hayti could endure a comparison with the higher
forms of white and European civilization. There was at the
Cape, under the name of the Hôtel de la République, an inn, the
exterior and interior splendour of which scarcely yielded to the
richest establishments of the kind in any part of the world. It
was frequented by the principal blacks and by the Americans
<pb id="beard138" n="138"/>
of the continent. There mere etiquette was unknown; the most
perfect equality prevailed. At the same table sat private 
individuals and the heads of the state, officers of every rank, men of
all conditions. It was frequently visited by L'Ouverture, who
took his place, without preference, in any vacant seat: for he
often said that distinction of rank ought to exist only in the
moment of public service.</p>
            <p>Travellers who visited the island at the beginning of the 
present century, warriors who played a part in the events of that
epoch, agree in declaring that in the society of Saint Domingo
the men were polite and the women easy and elegant; that the
relations between the sexes lacked neither attraction nor dignity,
and that the prejudices of colour seemed to have lost their
former power. The theatre came into vogue; the greater
number of the new actors were blacks, and some of them gave
proof of talent in comedy and in pantomime. A taste for music
became general; the guitar was specially cultivated. Men of
negro and mulatto blood not only formed the bulk of the 
population, but occupied the higher positions. Even the most 
important duties of the administration were in their hands. Yet
life went forward with ease and efficiency. Religion was
honoured. Morals were at least not inferior to what they are
in white society. The arts were cultivated.  The elegances of
life were not unknown. Among men and women who had but
recently quitted the brutalizing condition of servitude, an ability
and a refinement were observed, which you sometimes look for
in vain among men who have the reputation of being highly
cultivated.</p>

            <pb id="beard139" n="139"/>
            <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
            <argument>
              <p>Toussaint L'Ouverture takes measures for the perpetuation of the happy 
condition of Hayti, specially by publishing the draft of a Constitution in which
he is named governor for life, and the great doctrine of <hi rend="italics">Free-trade</hi> is
explicitly proclaimed.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THIS happy condition had no guarantee of permanence. True,
all was tranquil within the borders of Hayti. One after another
had Toussaint L'Ouverture removed hindrances out of the way,
until he had succeeded in establishing a universal accord. But
would the harmony endure? Its continuance was essential to
the full developement of the resources of the colony; and, to all
appearance, that continuance was the sole prerequisite. As
yet, however, there had been no general recognition of the
established order. If all were to work for the general good, all
must concur in the formation and acknowledgment of a 
constitution by which the established order might be perpetuated.</p>
            <p>In bringing that constitution into existence, and giving it the
force of law, three powers must concur. These three powers
were the inhabitants of Hayti, France, and Toussaint himself.
Self-government was a recognised right of the colony. The 
concurrence of France was equally an admitted fact in the colonial
government, and L'Ouverture held, under the authority of the
mother country, the highest functions in the island. When the
question of a constitution assumed a practical shape, it became
important to determine with which of these three authorities
the initiative should lie. Was the colony to look to France?
That question involved another,—was France sincere in her
acknowledgment of negro freedom? France appeared unworthy
of trust. The last despatches on the matter of a code of laws
for Hayti wore a suspicious aspect, and were generally disliked.
And if France wished to give the colony a good code of laws,
had she the power? How could the requisite knowledge be
possessed by a legislature which sat thousands of miles distant
<pb id="beard140" n="140"/>
from those who were to obey the laws? Metropolitan government 
for colonial dependencies is full of evils, arising not only
from ignorance and incompetence, but intrigue and corruption.
Beside, Bonaparte was now the sole legislative and the sole
ruling power in France. The position which Louis XIV. had
fancied himself to possess, when he declared himself to be the
state—“<foreign lang="fre">L'état, c'est moi,</foreign>”—the Corsican adventurer had fully
realized. The ruling passion of Bonaparte was ambition; his
means, resort to force. What had the colony to expect but a
<hi rend="italics">coup d'état</hi> similar to that which had just suppressed the Directory 
and concentrated all power in the hands of the first consul?
The thought is said to have disturbed the short hours of 
Toussaint's repose. The probability was, that the conqueror of Italy
only waited the moment of necessary leisure, and that moment,
as the event afterwards showed, might shortly arrive. 
Undesirable was it, therefore, to leave the initiative with France.
The colony itself must act. Indeed, the colony only could act
with wisdom and effect. “But in so doing the colony was
setting up for independence.” To take the first step in drawing
up a constitution cannot be justly so characterized. A draft of
a constitution was only a species of petition. Until sanctioned
by legislation, it amounted to nothing more than a bill of rights.
It did no more than say, “Here is a formal statement of what
will suit us, what will consolidate and augment our existing
weal, what we entreat you to send back with the seal of your
solemn sanction.” And were such a step a step towards 
independence, who can blame it? If the colony had acquired
strength enough to run alone, why should it remain in leading-strings? 
Nay, the desire for independence, if cherished, was a
worthy feeling. Such a desire showed that black men could
appreciate liberty, and well deserved the degree of freedom they
had already gained. The rather was a cautious approach to
independence praiseworthy, because tokens were not wanting
that Bonaparte, in his ambitious passions, had grown impatient
of the ascendancy of the great negro Haytian. Resolved to be
master of the world, he could not endure a rival power, and
watched his opportunity to establish his supremacy in the island.
<pb id="beard141" n="141"/>
The rather was he desirous of establishing the exclusive rule of
France there, because Hayti, he felt, could be made a bulwark
for hostile operations against the English power in the West
Indies.</p>
            <p>Yet was the colony passively and quietly to await the blow?
What was this but to invite the blow? Whereas, to propound
a constitution while it ought to give no offence, would prove that
the Haytians were sensible alike of their rights and of their
power. In the great issue, Toussaint had himself a problem to
solve. If, as he had reason to fear, Bonaparte intended his 
overthrow, was he to submit without an effort? Was he not, as a
prudent man and a wise legislator, to enter on such a course, as
seemed most likely to ward off the blow, and strengthen his own
position? As to the necessity of his continuing to hold that
position, he could not for a moment doubt. The retention of
the position was indispensable to the continuance of the peace in
the island. As all mountains had become plains before his
energy and determination, so would all be undone, if he were
removed from the head of affairs; once more the smouldering
fires of passion and prejudice would burst into a flame, and a war
arise not less bloody and terrific than that which he had so
recently brought to a happy conclusion. Yes; there, at the
helm, had he been placed by the resistless stream of events, or
what to him, nor without reason, seemed the hand of Providence;
and there duty, in the clearest and loudest tones, called upon him
to remain. This is, in substance, the feeling to which at this
time he gave utterance in these terms: “I have taken my flight
in the region of eagles; I must be prudent in alighting on the
earth: I can be placed only on a rock; and that rock must be a
constitutional government, which will secure me power so long
as I shall be among men.” Yes, if in any case, certainly in
Toussaint L'Ouverture's was a constitutional dictatorship of 
indispensable necessity. Rightly did he interpret his position, and
well did he understand his duties. This new Moses had brought
his people out of Egyptian bondage, and must now give them a
code of laws, over the execution of which, for the few remaining
years of his life, it is his most solemn duty to watch. Such 
<pb id="beard142" n="142"/>
conduct asks no defence, and admits no excuse. It is positively and
highly virtuous, and any other course would have been a 
betrayal of a sacred duty, a breach of a momentous trust.</p>
            <p>Again the hour of temptation has come. The victorious
general who commands universal obedience and enjoys universal
respect may become a president or a sovereign. The good 
principle conquers; Satan is dismissed with a rebuke; the crown is
refused, the presidency is deliberately chosen.</p>
            <p>Does the reader think of Washington, who, when he might
possibly have become a king, became a private citizen? We are
not sure that Washington's means for establishing a throne in
the midst of the high-minded republicans of the Anglo-Saxon
race were equal to those which Toussaint possessed among the
uncultured and recently liberated Haytians, whom nature made
fond of parade, and custom had habituated to royalty. The
greater the opportunity, the greater the temptation; nor can he
be accounted the inferior man who overcame in the severer
trial. Nor must it be forgotten, that while Washington could,
with confidence and safety, leave his associates to their own 
well-tried and well-matured powers of self-government, L'Ouverture
had, in comparison, but children to deal with and provide for.
Would it have been either prudent or benevolent to retire from
the oversight of those children at the very moment when they
had ceased to do evil and were learning to do well? Clearly,
duty, in the most solemn and emphatic tones, demanded the 
continuance of that fatherly care which had rescued those babes in
intellect from impending ruin, and so far led them toward the
attainment of individual strength and social excellence. Yes,
Toussaint L'Ouverture, an eagle thou hast proved thyself to be;
an eagle's eye shows thee distant but coming realities; may thine
eagle's pinion bear thee above danger, and place thee, where thou
longest to be, “on a rock,”—the rock of a wisely constituted and
well governed commonwealth! Then, like thy Hebrew prototype,
when at last thou descriest the promised land, and while thou
contemplatest its fertility and loveliness, thou mayest depart
from “among men,” falling to sleep in thy lofty eyrie, and
<pb id="beard143" n="143"/>
buried on the mountain, which shall be at once thy sepulchre
and thy monument.</p>
            <p>We do not possess the materials to determine whether the
idea of drawing up a constitution for Hayti originated with
Toussaint L'Ouverture himself, or was presented to him as the
proper course by his colonial advisers. The determination of
the question is of the less consequence since, beyond a doubt,
unanimity prevailed to a very great extent between the 
general-in-chief and the principal authorities and persons in the island.
One party, and but one, evinced repugnance to the measure.
The small number who represented the views of Bonaparte in
the colony were naturally adverse to the constitution. At their
head was Brigadier-General Vincent, who employed the influence
which excellence of character justly gave him with L'Ouverture
to turn him aside from the project. The effort proved nugatory.</p>
            <p>Resolved to persevere in a course which his judgment approved,
and his position required, Toussaint L'Ouverture, as possessing
the highest authority in the island, called together a council to
take into consideration the propriety of drawing up a constitution, 
and to determine what its provisions should be. The council 
consisted of nine members. The composition of this deliberative 
assembly displays the integrity of the general-in-chief.
He might have formed it out of his officers. He might have
given predominance in it to negro blood. These things, doubtless, 
he would have done, had he sought his own aggrandizement. 
But he chose its members among the men of property
and intelligence. Of the nine members, eight were white 
proprietors, and one a mulatto; not a single black had a seat at the
council-board. Even the purest patriotism might have required
him to place himself at the head of the council. Its president
was the white colonist Borgella, who had held the office of mayor
of Port-au-Prince. The constitution, carefully prepared by this
council, was presented to Toussaint L'Ouverture, who, having
approved it (May 19th, 1800), sent a copy by the hands of
General Vincent to Europe. The draft was accompanied by the
following letter, addressed to “Citizen Bonaparte, First Consul
of the French Republic (16th July).”</p>

            <p>This constitution, which had been made public and accepted
amid solemn formalities and universal joy, was worthy of the
cause in which L'Ouverture had risked his life and employed
the utmost of his strength. Proceeding on the basis that slavery
was abolished and could never more exist in Saint Domingo, and
that all men there born were free citizens of the French 
Republic, it provided that every one, whatever his colour, was
admissible to all employments, on the special ground that among
the citizens there was no other distinction than the distinction
<pb id="beard145" n="145"/>
of virtue and of ability. Establishing Roman Catholicism as the
sole religion to be professed and protected, it recognised the
sanctity of marriage by abolishing divorce. It required that
agriculture should receive special encouragement, for which
purpose measures were to be taken for the increase of the number
of labourers. The reins of government it entrusted to one
governor, to be appointed for the period of five years, with 
authority to prolong the term as a recompence of good conduct;
and that “in consideration of the important services which
General Toussaint L'Ouverture has rendered to the colony, he is
named Governor for life, with power to choose his successor.”</p>
            <p>One provision we have advisedly omitted in order to bring it
into full relief. In a very short sentence the constitution 
declares <hi rend="italics">commerce free.</hi> Thus free trade was first proclaimed by the
negro chief of Hayti. Is any other proof necessary that 
Toussaint was more than a successful warrior? more than a social
liberator? more than a disinterested patriot? His economical
views were large and liberal. They were in advance of their
age; how much in advance let the fact declare, that nearly half
a century had to elapse before even England obtained the boon
which Hayti not only claimed but decreed. Yet what was
there in Toussaint L'Ouverture which may not be found in other
negroes? His sole external advantage was that he received
some rudimental instruction in the simple arts of reading and
writing. Give that advantage to the myriads of blacks that
now vegetate and pine in slavery in the United States, and
other practical philosophers will appear among them to vindicate
the race by wise laws as well as philanthropy and heroism.
But “oh, it is not safe.” Safe? yes, much more safe than is the
present course, which does but concentrate the lava of the 
volcano, which, at no distant day, will burst forth, unless 
precautionary measures are taken, and due preparations be made for
lifting slaves into a condition fit for freedom. Surely this lesson
is taught in the tenor of the preceding narrative.</p>

              <p>Peace of Amiens—Bonaparte contemplates the subjugation of Saint Domingo,
and the restoration of slavery—Excitement caused by report to that effect in
the island—Views of Toussaint L'Ouverture on the point.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE year 1801 did not close without seeing the peace of Amiens
definitively concluded. By the treaty then signed, France found
herself confirmed in the possessions she had captured during the
war, and at liberty to prosecute any enterprise which she might
judge required by her position, or likely to conduce to the 
confirmation of her power. Her destinies were in the hands of
Napoleon Bonaparte, who, under the modest title of Consul,
concealed designs which already looked to an imperial throne,
and ruled the nation and its dependencies with a sceptre more
powerful and more despotic than the sway of any 
contemporaneous legitimate monarch. Born with the qualities which
give and ensure command, Bonaparte, to a boundless ambition,
added a restless activity which constantly prompted new efforts,
a thirst for dominion, which as constantly demanded new 
acquisitions, and a jealousy of power which made rival greatness
intolerable. With an evil eye, therefore, did he regard the high
position obtained by Toussaint L'Ouverture through his wise and
generous efforts in the French colony of Saint Domingo. The
brilliancy of his own fame seemed dimmed in his eyes by the
glory achieved by a negro chieftain who had been a slave.</p>
            <pb id="beard147" n="147"/>
            <p>The termination of the war had left unoccupied in France a
large body of soldiers, who might be dangerous at home, and
whose leaders, in the repose of peace, might trouble his actual
position, or prove impediments to his ambitious designs. Dissatisfied 
with seeing themselves outstripped by a soldier of fortune,
they were ready for political intrigue rather than civil obedience, 
and would be most safely employed in a distant expedition in
which success would increase the number of his own laurels, and
failure issue in their permanent removal out of his path. That
the climate in which he thought of employing them was destructive 
to Europeans, was a consideration which could not deter
him, and only added another reason why, on his part, he should
decide in favour of the attempt.</p>
            <p>Yet if he left Hayti in the hands of Toussaint L'Ouverture,
he would possess, in an army of thirty thousand black troops
obedient to their actual commander, the means of countervailing
the power of Great Britain in the West Indies, and of controlling
its descendants in the United States. The employment, however, 
of such an ally seemed scarcely compatible with the dignity
which he affected; nor was it impossible, if the ruler of Saint
Domingo were left undisturbed in his authority, that he might
assist the absolute independence of the colony, and either by
augmenting his own power or joining the English, inflict a
heavy blow on the supremacy of France. Then the question of
colonial slavery presented itself for consideration. Should he
recognise or nullify the freedom which existed in Saint Domingo?
The recognition would bring him no advantage, for Toussaint
his associates considered their work as accomplished. To
nullify it would secure on his side the sympathies and co-operation
of the colonists who had lost their estates, and who, 
regretting their past opulence, and believing its recovery impossible
in the present state of the island, besieged the cabinet of the
Tuilleries with importunities for the restoration of slavery. The
wise and just held a different language. Even as a matter of
policy an expedition to Hayti, they urged, was to be deprecated,
for the risk would be very great, and failure would end in 
disgrace. Those who now held power in the island, were men of
<pb id="beard148" n="148"/>
valour and of great military skill. As administrators of the colony
they enjoyed general sympathy and support, and had proved
their ability by the prosperity they had called into being. And
while it did not become France, who had gained her own liberty,
to suppress freedom in one of her own colonies, it was contrary
to the laws of everlasting right to tear from men that freedom
which they had purchased with their blood, and, by their
moderation, proved they well deserved. These diverse views
occupied the minds and dwelt on the tongues of men in Paris,
according as position, character, or personal interests swayed
their bosoms. The consul heard them all, and kept shrouded
in his own dark breast the design which he meditated and was
maturing. At the moment Vincent arrived from Saint Domingo,
he presented the constitution to the consul. Here was the
spark which that sombre genius desired. “He is a revolted
slave whom we must punish; the honour of France is 
outraged.” In vain was it pleaded before Bonaparte that the
adoption or rejection of the constitution lay with himself, and
that it contained only the expression of the wishes of Toussaint
and his fellow-labourers. Bonaparte was too adroit not to seize,
and too skilful not to make the most of the opportunity. His
words, which we have just reported, circulated through Paris,
and excited a feeling in favour of war. An expedition was
decided on. And the popular fervour was increased when the
consul declared in the senate that Toussaint was a brigand chief
whom it was necessary to bring to justice. One voice was raised
against the undertaking—a voice in the high places of authority.
The minister Forfait, a man of high character, attempted to
dissuade Bonaparte by setting before him a picture of the 
inevitable calamities of such an enterprise. He was silenced by
the answer, “There are sixty thousand men that I want to send
to a distance.”</p>
            <p>And so, from the most unworthy considerations, an armament
against a peaceful and flourishing state is to be speedily fitted
out. Yet the adventurers call themselves Christians. What
but robbery on a large scale is such conduct? And who can

believe that the man who decreed that robbery, had in his heart
any genuine love of liberty?</p>
            <p>Once more, Toussaint L'Ouverture, must you take the
buckler and draw the sword. The hero of Europe, panting for
conquests in another world, comes against you. Once more
must the broad rich plains of your native land resound with the
clash of hostile armies, and run with human blood. A cloud is
on your countenance. Yet let it pass away. Take courage, noble
heart! The coming struggle is only another step in the path
of freedom. Necessary is the step, or you would not have to
take it. And if the effort is painful, and the prospect dark,
weigh well the magnitude of the issues. On the fields of Hayti
the battle of your race will be fought out. It is before the eye,
not of a few islanders, but of the world, that you are about to
try your strength with the Gallic gladiator, and settle the
question once for all, whether Africans are men or brutes,
worthy of freedom, or doomed to servitude. Success? No, the
settlement of the question depends not on success. You will
perish in the combat, yet will you win; your cause will triumph
even over your grave. Be just, and fear not.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, rumours and intelligence brought to Hayti 
produced sinister impressions, and disturbed the public mind. It
appeared probable that slavery would be maintained in the French
colonies of Martinique and Cayenne, and that at Saint Domingo
France would make an effort for its restoration. Fears began
to prevail, disturbances were threatened. Every eye turned to
Toussaint L'Ouverture. On his part, he was not without 
forebodings, which recently had grown into apprehensions. He had
written to the consul, and received no reply. He felt himself
humiliated. At times tears stole from his eyes when he thought
of the possibility that Bonaparte meant to undo all that he had
done; foreseeing the long train of calamities which would ensue
from such an attempt, he was now and then for an instant
unmanned, and spoke hasty words. “Bonaparte,” he said, “is
wrong not to write to me; he must have listened to my
enemies, otherwise would he refuse me proofs of his satisfaction?
<pb id="beard150" n="150"/>
Me, I say, who have rendered greater services to France than
any other general? The English and Spanish governments
treat with more regard the generals who have signalized 
themselves by services of the first order.” His fears and his vexation
became greater, and affected his demeanour in a more marked
manner, when he heard that preliminaries of peace between
England and France had been signed at London. Peace in
Europe he saw foreboded war to Hayti.</p>
            <p>What now should be his course? Should he anticipate the
blow, and prepare for it by proclaiming the independence
of the colony? By rousing its inhabitants to resistance, and
marshalling his forces with his own ability and vigour, he might
repel even the attack of France when at peace with the world.
And right would such a policy have been. Not impossibly it
would have proved successful. But L'Ouverture was not 
prepared to adopt it. Equal to the demands on his courage and
energy which a determination of the kind would make, he was
not equal to the requisite demands on his sense of justice.
Hayti was a French colony;—as a French colony it had gained
its freedom. A free republic would not sanction its subjugation;
and should Bonaparte attempt to wrest “the rod of empire” out
of his own hands, he had better lose his power than forfeit his
self-respect. Anyway, the duty of the moment was clear; he
must calm men's minds. For that purpose, he issued a 
proclamation (18th Dec. 1801), which, among other things, declared
that it was necessary to receive the orders and the envoys of
the mother country with respect and filial regard. Yet, while
he encouraged obedience, he could not be insensible to the 
possibility that resistance might be his duty. He was, therefore,
under an obligation to foster the means of resistance, and not
only to appear confident himself, but to keep up the spirits of
his soldiers. This twofold state of mind is seen in words which
he uttered from time to time, as in these:—“A well-educated
child owns submission and obedience to his mother; but if that
mother becomes so unnatural as to seek the ruin of her child,
the child must look for justice with Him to whom vengeance
<pb id="beard151" n="151"/>
belongs. If I must die, I will die as a brave soldier, as a man
of honour. I fear no one.”</p>
            <p>It did not escape the eye of those who, having access to the
president, narrowly watched him, that the agitation of his mind
increased, and had risen to a great height. Catching alarm
from these symptoms, some began to take measures for quitting
the island. One of the most distinguished Creoles of Port-au-Prince, 
and who afterwards settled in France, was of the number.
He one day asked Toussaint in private for a passport, in order to
proceed to the mother country. The unexpected request 
disturbed the president. Hastening to the door, to ascertain if
he could reckon on their not being disturbed, he speedily
returned and asked, looking his companion fixedly in the face,
“Why do you wish to go away? You, whom I esteem and
love?” “Because I am white, and because, notwithstanding
the good feelings you have for me, I see that you are on the eve
of being the irritated chief of the blacks, and that within these
few days you are no longer the protector of the whites, since
you have just sent out of the island several for having expressed
joy that the Europeans were about to come to Saint Domingo.”
“Yes,” replied Toussaint, with warmth, “they have had the
imprudence and folly to rejoice at such news, as if the 
expedition was not destined to destroy me—to destroy the whites—
to destroy the colony. In France I am represented as an
independent power, and therefore they are arming against me.
—Against me, who refused General Maitland to establish my
independence under the protection of England, and who always
rejected the proposals which Sonthonax made on the subject.
Since, however, you wish to set out for France, I consent to it;
but, at least, let your voyage be useful to the colony. I will
send by you letters to the first consul, and I will entreat him to
listen to you. Make him acquainted with me; make him
acquainted with the prosperous state of the agriculture and the
commerce of the colony; in a word, let him know what I have
done. It is according to all that I have done here that I
ought, and that I wish to be judged. Twenty times have I
written to Bonaparte, to ask him to send civil commissioners,
<pb id="beard152" n="152"/>
to tell him to despatch hither the old colonists, whites instructed
in administering public affairs, good machinists, good workmen;
he has never replied. Suddenly he avails himself of the peace
(of which he has not deigned to inform me, and which I learn
only through the English) in order to direct against me a
formidable expedition, in the ranks of which I see my personal
enemies, and people injurious to the colony, whom I sent away.
Come to me within four-and-twenty hours. Very ardently do
I wish that you and my letters may arrive in time to make
the first consul change his determination, and to make him
sensible that in ruining me he ruins the blacks—he ruins not
only Saint Domingo, but also all the western colonies. If
Bonaparte is the first man in France, Toussaint is the first man
in the Archipelago of the Antilles.” After a moment of
reflection, he added, in a firm tone, “I was going to treat with
the Americans and the English to procure me twenty thousand
blacks from the coast, but I had no other object than to make
soldiers of them for France. I know the perfidy of the English.
I am under no obligation to them for the information they give
me as to the expedition coming to Saint Domingo. No! never
will I arm for them! I took up arms for the freedom of my
colour, which France alone proclaimed, but which she has no
right to nullify. Our liberty is no longer in her hands; it is
our own! We will defend it or perish.”</p>

            <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
            <argument>
              <p>Bonaparte cannot be turned from undertaking an expedition against Toussaint—
Resolves on the enterprise in order chiefly to get rid of his republican 
associates in arms—Restores slavery and the slave-trade—Excepts Hayti from the
decree—Misleads Toussaint's sons—Despatches an armament under Leclerc.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN vain was it that Vincent, who had attempted to dissuade
Toussaint against the adventure of a constitution, now employed
his honest and prudent arguments to turn aside Bonaparte from
<pb id="beard153" n="153"/>
the intended expedition against Saint Domingo. Disregardful
of the effect which his advice might have on himself, he urged on
the consul that the victorious warriors of Europe would lose their
energy, together with their strength, under the climate of the
Antilles; that such a climate would annihilate the army, even if
the ascendancy of Toussaint L'Ouverture over the inhabitants
did not succeed in destroying it by arms; he added the consideration 
of the probability that the English would openly or secretly
endeavour to traverse his object, and frustrate his attempt. To
the last remark Bonaparte answered—“The cabinet of St. James's
has been disposed to set itself in opposition to my sending a
squadron to Saint Domino; I have notified to it, that if it did
not consent, I would send to Toussaint unlimited powers, and 
acknowledge him as independent. It has said no more to me on the
point.” If this is correct, England, it may be presumed, was
influenced by fear for the effects of such a recognition on her
neighbouring slave colony of Jamaica. Thus does wrong 
support wrong. Having effected nothing in conversation, Vincent
addressed to the consul a written document, in which, after
setting forth the means of defence which the colony possessed,
he said—“At the head of so many resources is a man the most
active and indefatigable that can possibly be imagined. It may
be strictly said, that he is everywhere; and especially at the spot
where sound judgment and danger would say that his presence
is most essential; his great moderation, his power, peculiar to
himself, of never needing rest—the advantage he has of being
able to resume the labours of the cabinet after laborious journeys;
of replying to a hundred letters every day, and of habitually
fatiguing five secretaries; more still, the skill of amusing and
deceiving everybody, carried even to deceit, make him a man so
superior to all around him, that respect and submission go to
the extent of fanaticism in a very great number of persons; it
may be affirmed, that no man of the present day has acquired
over an ignorant mass, the boundless power obtained by General
Toussaint over his brethren in Saint Domingo; he is the absolute 
master of the island; and nothing can counteract his wishes,
whatever they are, although some distinguished men, of whom,
<pb id="beard154" n="154"/>
however, the number among the blacks is very small, know and
fear the extent to which his views proceed.” Bonaparte was
displeased at the frankness of these representations, and banished
Vincent, their author, to the island of Elba, whither, at a later
period he was himself to be banished.</p>
            <p>Resolved to disembarrass himself of the veterans in union
with whom he had gained his renown, but who now from their
strong republican sympathies blocked up his way to the imperial
throne, he called a council to deliberate on the most effectual
means to be taken in order to bring Toussaint under his yoke.
The members of the council were, of course, Bonaparte's creatures. 
Their desire to please the real sovereign of the land was
stronger than their professed attachment to liberty. The councillors 
recommended the employment of force in order to re-establish 
slavery; a large number proposed, that for the sake of terror,
those whom they characterized as “the guilty” should be
decimated. The bishop of Blois, Gregory, that immortal friend
of the cause of the blacks, had not given his opinion. “What do
you think on the matter?” asked the consul. “I think,” he
replied, “that the hearing of such speeches suffices to show that
they are uttered by whites; if these gentlemen were this
moment to change colour, they would talk differently.” The
restoration of slavery was resolved in the legislative body by a
vote of two hundred-and-twelve against sixty-five. Such was
the love of Frenchmen for liberty, for the rights of man, for the
rights of their fellow-citizens, for the freedom of the black 
population of Hayti. The determination of itself justifies the course
pursued by Toussaint L'Ouverture. His constitution may prove
an ineffectual guarantee of the hardly-earned liberties of his colour,
but clearly it afforded the only feasible chance of perpetuating
the good he had wrought out.</p>
            <p>On the 20th of May, 1801, Bonaparte published the infamous
decree which replaced the French colonies in the state in which
they were before the year 1789, and which, authorizing the slave
trade, abrogated all laws to the contrary. This execrable measure
marks the real character of the Corsican adventurer, and hands
his name down to posterity covered with disgrace. Soon, 
<pb id="beard155" n="155"/>
however, did he find that in an evil hour he had overstepped
the limits of prudence; and therefore he put forth another decree
which hypocritically excepted Saint Domingo and Guadaloupe,
“because these islands are free, not only by right, but in fact—
whilst the other colonies are actually in slavery, and it would be
dangerous to put an end to that state of things.”</p>
            <p>The preparation of the public mind for the unjust and wicked
attempt to put down liberty in Saint Domingo, was aided by the
less obvious but powerful efforts, not only of the colonists in general,
but by the mulattoes who dwelt at Paris, of whom Rigaud may
be considered as the head. Overcome and exiled by Toussaint,
Rigaud panted for revenge. In that vindictive sentiment, he
well represented his race, who could not forgive the black 
president for having extorted the freedom of his colour out of their
hands.</p>
            <p>There were in Paris two young men who looked on the
arrangements for the expedition which they saw everywhere
proceeding, with anxiety and alarm. These were Isaac and
Placide L'Ouverture, sons of the liberator of Hayti, whom, as a
testimony of his confidence, and a pledge of his fidelity, their
father had sent to Paris for their education. They both 
resided in the College La Marche, of which Coasnon was the 
principal. The consul judged it politic to throw a veil over their
eyes. Intending to destroy the father, he had no scruples of
conscience about deluding the sons. Coasnon, their teacher,
being gained over, assured the young men that the French
government had none but pacific views. A few days afterwards,
he received a letter from the Minister of Marine, apprising him
that the consul wished to see and converse with his pupils
before their departure. Repairing to the minister's residence,
they received in the presence of Coasnon a confirmation of his
statement that the intentions of the government were of a
friendly nature. They were then conducted to Bonaparte, who,
the better to conceal his real purposes, received them in a 
flattering manner. Having ascertained which of the two was
Toussaint's own son, he said to him:—“Your father is a great
man; he has rendered eminent services to France. You will
<pb id="beard156" n="156"/>
tell him that I, the first magistrate of the French people, promise 
him protection, glory, and honour. Do not think that France 
intends to carry war to Saint Domingo; the army which it sends 
thither is destined not to attack the troops of the country, but 
to augment their numbers. Here is General Leclerc, my 
brother-in-law, whom I have appointed Captain-General, and 
who will command that armament. Orders have been given 
for you to arrive at Saint Domingo a fortnight before the 
fleet, to announce to your father the coming of the expedition.” 
On the next day, the delusion was carried still farther, for
the Minister of Marine, as a kind of practical assurance 
how well Toussaint and his children stood with the highest 
authorities, entertained the young men at a magnificent repast; 
and shortly after, in order to complete the farce by an appeal 
to negro vanity, he, in the name of his government, presented to 
them a superb suit of armour, and a rich and brilliant military 
costume.</p>
            <p>It scarcely needs be stated that the promise that the youths 
should have time to assure their father of the pacific intentions 
of France, was not observed. Having answered its momentary 
purpose, it was openly and deliberately violated. The real 
design of all this collusion was that, misled by the reports of his 
sons in Paris, Toussaint L'Ouverture might be taken off his 
guard. Alas! that in the crisis of his fate, he should have given 
credit to men who blushed not to deal in falsehood.</p>
            <p>It has already appeared from the consul's own words, that he 
had chosen Leclerc, who was the husband of his sister Pauline, 
to be at the head of the expedition. Bonaparte was well 
pleased to have the opportunity of separating himself from 
Leclerc, whom he regarded as a relative little worthy of his 
present and his future greatness. The obscure birth of Leclerc 
in the small town of Pontoise, disquieted his pride. Every day 
there came to Paris persons of low condition who gave 
themselves out as relatives of the consul's sister. That sister
possessed so rare a beauty, that Canova reproduced her features 
in his statue of Venus Victrix, <hi rend="italics">Victorious Venus.</hi> To personal charms she added subtlety and grace of mind. Her looks
<pb id="beard157" n="157"/>
awakened desires in the most indifferent hearts. She gathered
around her all the artifices of voluptuousness. In her furniture
she was luxurious; elegant in her personal decorations, and
choice in the persons attached to her suite. She was attended
by painters, musicians, and buffoons. Pauline accompanied her
husband in the expedition. Leclerc was small in stature, but he
had vivacity of mind and grace of manner. In countenance he
was thought to bear some resemblance to the consul. Though
he had showed some courage and perseverance in the campaigns
of the Alps and the Rhine, he was little else than the blind
instrument of his brother-in-law, whom he imitated in war
as well as in peace, with a closeness which betokened a 
contracted intellect. From such a man was expected the final
settlement of the long quarrel of colour in Saint Domingo.</p>
            <p>The preparations for the armament were made in different
ports. No expense was spared. Holland, then under the
domination of France and Spain, kept in alliance with it by fear,
furnished ships. The fleet, when collected, was composed of
twenty-one frigates, and thirty-five vessels of war. It had on
board all the best sailors of France, and was commanded by
Villaret Joyeuse. In December, 1801, portions of it left the
ports of Brest, Rochefort and Lorient. The rest were to sail
from other points. The ocean was covered with ships in order
to punish a contumacious slave! The magnitude of the equipment 
is a measure of Toussaint's power. This fleet bore to
Hayti one of the most valiant of armies. The Alps, Italy, the
Rhine, and the Nile resounded with the exploits of the veterans
who formed its strength. They now left lands which boasted of
their civilization, to carry chains to a people who, uncultured
though they were, had vindicated their freedom, and used that
freedom wisely.</p>
            <p>As soon as the fleet had anchored off Cape Samana, at the
eastern end of Saint Domingo, Leclerc numbered his sea and
land forces, including others which he expected. They amounted
to sixty ships and more than thirty thousand men, commanded
by generals and captains of experience and renown. Among
them were men of colour, who had become illustrious in
<pb id="beard158" n="158"/>
the sanguinary struggle for emancipation. There was found
Rigaud, whose valour had disputed the laurel with Toussaint
himself There was found Pétion, who under a mild physiognomy 
bore a lofty spirit; he was destined to found and govern a
republic in the island he took part in invading. There was
found Boyer, his illustrious successor, who by a treaty with the
king of France was one day to secure the permanent independence 
of his native land. All these mulatto chiefs had consented
to second the expedition with their council, their courage, and
their example. On the other side, the forces of Toussaint 
consisted at most of sixteen thousand men; five in the north, four
in the west, four in the south, and three in what was formerly the
Spanish territory. These troops thus scattered, were, however,
commanded by captains well trained to mountain warfare; all
were animated by the love of freedom, which they cherished the
more because they had acquired it at the cost of labour, peril,
and bloodshed. Everywhere the Haytian army would find
auxiliaries; soldiers, women, children, citizens, had all lived in the
camps of the civil wars. Full of recollections of their former
servitude, they were ready to perish sooner than submit.</p>
            <p>The gathering of the fleet at Samana took several weeks. The
effect of a sudden descent was lost. On hearing that a fleet was
approaching the island, Toussaint L'Ouverture threw the bridle
over his horse's neck, and galloped to Cape Samana to 
reconnoitre the squadrons. Unversed in marine affairs, he at first
took the manœuvring for hesitation. But as the vessels
anchored in their several places, having never seen so large a
fleet before, he was struck with astonishment, and feeling for a
moment discouraged, he exclaimed to his officers, “We must
perish; all France is coming to Saint Domingo; it has been
deceived, it comes to take revenge and enslave the blacks.”</p>
            <p>Convinced as he was of the hostile designs of the armament,
Toussaint could not deny that its heralds had announced friendship. 
As little did he possess the right of making war against
the forces of the country to which he professed allegiance. Had
he already proclaimed the independence of Hayti, he would have
been relieved from the perplexity of a dubious position. Even
<pb id="beard159" n="159"/>
had he at this last moment proclaimed independence, he would
have been saved from the evils of vacillation. But being
neither at peace nor at war with his assailants, he laboured under
a great disadvantage. However, he made such arrangements as
his unhappy position permitted. To act on the defensive was
compulsory on him in the circumstances, and probably such a
policy was every way the best. Should the armament prove
really hostile; should it attack the island, then resistance must
be made; and if defeat ensued, there were the mountains for a 
retreat, and a succession of strong holds where an almost unlimited
defence might be maintained.</p>
            <p>At length the fleet put itself in movement. After having 
detached Kerverseau to go and take possession of the
city of Saint Domingo, Leclerc directed the armament in
three divisions against three principal points; Fort Dauphin,
and the city of the Cape in the north, and Port-au-Prince
in the west. The island was thus invested. No declaration 
of war was made, no negotiations were opened. The
squadrons sailed to the several points as if they approached a
friendly shore, and as a matter of course entered friendly
harbours. Nor could they be challenged. Toussaint possessed
no vessels, and if he had had vessels, was he not a French
subject, and were these not French ships and French 
commanders?</p>
            <p>It was not possible for Isaac and Placide L'Ouverture any
longer to doubt the nature of the errand on which the 
armament had been sent. They drew up in writing remonstrances
which they presented to Leclerc, who doubtless smiled in his
thoughts at their easy faith.</p>
          </div3>

            <pb id="beard160" n="160"/>
            <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
            <argument>
              <p>Leclerc obtains possession of the chief positions in the island, and yet is not
master thereof—By arms and by treachery he establishes himself at the Cape,
at Fort Dauphin, at Saint Domingo, and at Port-au-Prince—Toussaint
L'Ouverture depends on his mountain strongholds.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE main squadron, under the immediate direction of Leclerc,
proceeded to act against Cape City. Sent on an errand of
duplicity, the commander meant war, yet was obliged to feign
peace. His aim was, if possible, to obtain possession of the Cape,
under the cover of friendship. Surely, admission into a French
port could not be denied to French forces. In order to effect
his purpose, he sent Lebrun, aide-de-camp of the admiral 
Villaret Joyeuse, on shore, to announce his intention of landing his
troops. Lebrun was conducted to General Christophe, who held
the place on behalf of the insular authorities. As Lebrun passed
along, he, as if by accident, let fall a number of proclamations,
intended to serve the cause of Bonaparte by stirring up the 
inhabitants. Having put his papers into the hands of Christophe,
he received for answer, “Without the orders of the Governor-General 
Toussaint L'Ouverture, who at present is in the Spanish
part, I cannot receive the squadron and the troops which are on
board.” Lebrun whispered in the ear of Christophe, that General 
Leclerc was the bearer of splendid tokens of the favour of the
government toward him. “No, sir,” was the prompt and decided
reply, “I cannot listen to any proposition without the orders of
the governor. The proclamations you bring breathe despotism
and tyranny. I shall go and administer to my soldiers an oath
to maintain our liberty at the peril of their lives.” The 
proclamation covertly published by Lebrun, was not wholly without
effect. A deputation of citizens waited on Christophe to impress
on him the responsibility he took on himself in withstanding the
orders of the mother country. He replied that he was a 
soldier; that he acknowledged as his supreme chief only Toussaint
<pb id="beard161" n="161"/>
L'Ouverture; that nothing proved to him that a squadron over
which they saw foreign banners float, had been sent by the
mother country; that France would have taken other means to
cause its commands to be acknowledged, and that it would have
sent them by an envoy, and not by foreign squadrons. He ended
by declaring, that if Leclerc, who called himself Captain-general,
persisted in his resolution to enter the Cape, he would set the
whole in flames rather than the ships should anchor in the 
harbour. However, he permitted a deputation of the city to go on
board Leclerc's ship, and entreat a delay of two days, in order
that Toussaint might be consulted. The general assured the
deputies, that France, full of affection for the colony, had made
every arrangement for its happiness; he set forth in a few words
the great and benevolent projects which the mother country had
for Toussaint L'Ouverture, whose sons it sent back after having
educated them with the greatest care; he announced that he
brought General Christophe proofs of the public gratitude, and
remarked how monstrous would be the ingratitude of which
those two chiefs seemed disposed to render themselves guilty.
He added, that the conduct of General Christophe having caused
him to fear that he would employ the delay asked for in order,
by drawing together his forces, to secure the success of the
meditated resistance, he could not postpone the entrance of the
squadron, and that he should make his arrangements in the space
of half-an-hour—time sufficient to enable General Christophe to
repair the disgrace of his revolt by prompt submission. 
Christophe remained unmoved by the allurements and the threats of
the French commander, though supported by the following
letter:—</p>
            <q type="letter" direct="unspecified">
              <text>

                    <p>“I learn with indignation, citizen general, that you refuse to
receive the French squadron and army which I command,
under the pretext that you have not any order from the governor
general.</p>
                    <p>“France has made peace with England, and its government

I warn you that if this very day you do not put into my
possession the forts Picolet, Belair, and all the batteries of the coast,
to-morrow at dawn fifteen thousand men shall be disembarked.
Four thousand at this moment are landing at Fort Liberté, eight
thousand at Port Republican; you will find my proclamation
joined to this communication; it expresses the intentions of the
French government; but, remember, whatever esteem your 
conduct in the colony has inspired me with, I hold you responsible
for whatever may take place.</p>

            <p>The letter, and the tone of the captain-general served only to
inflame the spirit of resistance, which had time to gather strength,
because the squadron, not being able to procure pilots, was obliged
to gain the open sea without being able to land the troops.
Christophe mustered the soldiers of the line and made them swear
to conquer or die, conformably to the proclamation of Toussaint
L'Ouverture, dated the 18th of December, 1801. The 
proclamation of Leclerc, intended to win over the civil authorities
and the inhabitants, assumed a more pacific character, and 
promised to all the soldiers and functionaries of the colony, 
whatever their colour, the confirmation of their rank and their offices.
Smitten with fear, some of the civil authorities endeavoured to
prevail with Christophe, but he was not a man to be easily 
overcome.</p>
            <p>That chief, born in the island of Grenada, first an emancipated
slave, then an innkeeper, a tradesman, and a cattle dealer, ended
by becoming a king. To the advantage of great height, he added
that of a majestic carriage, and an eye fall of fire. He had a
strong soul, adorned with civic, domestic, and military virtues.
His prudence led him to trust little to fortune. He was active,
patient, and temperate. Without having been instructed in the
schools, he spoke with ease and grace: he took peculiar pleasure
in diverting his guests by the recital of adventures or his valorous
<pb id="beard163" n="163"/>
exploits. He was moreover liable to contrasts of temper which
indicated the fiery impulses of his character. Some of his 
excellencies he lost when seated on a throne. When the messenger
Of Leclerc urged him to surrender the city, he replied with
hauteur, “Go and tell your general that the French shall march
here only over ashes, and that the ground shall burn beneath
their feet.” He afterwards wrote his determination in these
terms—“The decision of arms can admit you only into a city in
ashes, and even on these ashes I will fight still!” Inexorable to
the entreaties of treacherous natives, he was assailed by the
following proclamation from Bonaparte, which they received
from the hands of Leclerc, and put into circulation.</p>

            <p>This proclamation was not of a nature to inspire confidence in
men whom servitude had made habitually distrustful. The
words of the Consul appeared those of a master who alternately
employs promises and threats. The people of the Cape had no
need of being assured of a liberty which they actually enjoyed;
and that wrath presented under the image of the conflagration
of their harvests, looked, in their eyes, like a token of slavery.
All declared that they would rather perish than return to 
servitude. While time was thus spent in useless words, the war
had begun without any negotiation with Toussaint, whether an
order to that effect had been given by the Consul, that he might
strike terror into the inhabitants, or whether Leclerc considered
that promptitude was the best means of commanding obedience.
Rochambeau, who had been sent against Fort Dauphin, attacked
the place by land and by sea. Everything soon yielded to
French valour. The blacks fled, but in flying set the city on
fire. At the sight of the flames, Rochambeau slaughtered all the
prisoners, whom he treated as revolters. The bay of Mancenille
was stained with the blood of many unarmed blacks, whose
crime was that they had shouted “No whites! no slavery!”</p>
            <p>Afraid lest Christophe should carry his threat into execution
and set Cape City on fire, Leclerc resolved to take the enemy in
the rear by landing his forces in the Bay of Acul. But the
movement of the vessels and the noise of the cannon spread on
all sides tumult and alarm. Burning plantations announced that
flames would soon rise from the town. Christophe, threatened
by sea and by land by two bodies of foes, determined to set fire
to the Cape. After distributing torches to his soldiers, and to
all who were devoted to so sacred a cause, he called the Almighty
Protector of liberty to witness that he was driven to extremity,
and commenced the conflagration with his own residence, 
<pb id="beard165" n="165"/>
decorated in a costly manner by the arts of luxury. An ocean of
flames rose in the air; roofs fell in all on fire; and in those
flames the black man saw the preservation of his liberty. The
appearance of the fleet, the blood of blacks and whites flowing on
two parts of the coast, terror, confusion, the loss of so much
wealth, awoke in all hearts the former furies of freedom and
slavery. At the sight of the flames, which changed night into
day, those passions painted themselves on white as well as black
countenances. But no cries, no complaints were heard. Only
fingers were pointed to the high lands above the Cape where
freedom might find an asylum. The flight took place in silence,
as if vengeance was deferred in order to be more terrible. An
explosion of a powder magazine crowned that work of courage
and despair. The flames of the conflagration were seen nearly
at the same time by the French fleet and by Toussaint L'Ouverture, 
who arrived in the neighbourhood from Santo Domingo,
and who then regretted that he had not lost his life, in the plains
of the Artibonite when he fought for France and for his country,
so great was his grief. He showed compassion to a multitude of
old men, women and children, who were scattered on all the
roads, and who were flying through the mountains. How 
embarrassing his Position; the Cape and Fort Dauphin had been
treated as hostile cities.</p>
            <p>Christophe, who had set on fire his own house and the city,
manifested a generosity too rare in war; fearing lest, in the 
confusion and the tumult of the conflagration, some two thousand
whites with their wives and children might become victims of
his men, he conducted them into a place of safety. After
abandoning the Cape, Christophe joined Toussaint, and 
conjointly they raised fire and flames everywhere. At the request
of his chief, Christophe took up a position at La Grande
Rivière, while Toussaint himself went towards the plain of the
north. Both were thus immediately above the invading forces.
The latter in proceeding to his post found himself face to face
with the advanced guard of Leclerc, and passed through a most
terrible fire. His cloak was riddled with balls, and his horse
was wounded. Reaching Mornay, he received a letter from
<pb id="beard166" n="166"/>
Rochambeau, who sought to set off his glory by affectations
of pity. “I did not expect,” he said, “that my soldiers in 
arriving here would have to dye their bayonets in the blood of their
brothers and their friends.” Toussaint L'Ouverture found it 
desirable to quit Mornay, and passing through Ennery, where was his
wife with apart of his family, made his way toward Gonaïves in
the west. While Leclerc and Rochambeau were conquering in the
north towns which were in ashes, their co-operator, General
Boudet, in the west, was seeking by stratagem as much as by
force to take possession of Port-au-Prince. That city, built of
wood, was the rival of the Cape. Agé, who was entrusted with
its defence, had not a soul proof against treachery. But along
side of him there served a captain worthy of “the good old
times.” Lamartinière possessed an heroic soul; his firmness, his
courage, and his patience could not be surpassed. With a handful 
of soldiers, he was capable of resisting the efforts of an army.
When the surrender of the city was demanded, the reply was
the same as that which had been given at the Cape, only the
threat of carnage was subjoined to the threat of conflagration.
“If,” replied the blacks, “if the French disembark before we can
be informed of the resolution of Toussaint, three cannon shot,
repeated from mountain top to mountain top, shall be the signal
for the conflagration of our homes, and for the death of those
who may endeavour to make us slaves.”</p>
            <p>Not without disgust nor without fear, did Boudet, who had
gained renown in the Antilles by wresting Guadaloupe from the
hands of the English, land near Lamentin, distant about a league
to the west of Port-au-Prince. At the appointed signal, flames
arose on all sides. Frightful disorder prevailed in the town.
The blacks, dreading slavery, pursued the whites through the
streets, and even searched for them in hiding-places. At the
recollection of the evils of their past servitude, marks of which
many of them still bore in their mutilated bodies, they saw in
the whites only pitiless masters, and slew them unsparingly, or
carried them away as hostages into the mountains. A large
number of women, children, and old men sought in a church an
asylum against the rage of their former slaves, who, in spite <sic corr="of">o</sic>
<pb id="beard167" n="167"/>
the sanctity of the place, were on the point of sacrificing them
as victims to their liberty; but a priest appeared, and called out
for mercy; presenting the sacred utensils of the altar, and
assuaging the wrath of the assailants, he saved the lives of the
trembling and helpless crowd; but the raging men hastened
away to find, in less hallowed places, whites on whom they might
effectually wreak their terrible vengeance. Boudet, unused to
the terrors that arose on every hand, exhorted his soldiers to
mercy. “My comrades,” he said, “you must regard these people
as fellow-citizens; this is no foreign land, it is your country.
Do not make use of your arms; uncover your breasts to them,
in order that those who follow us may have the right to avenge
us.” By the treachery of its defenders, he obtained possession of
Fort Bizoton, by which his progress might have been long
stopped. Agé was thinking of surrendering the city itself, but
Lamartinière, indignant at a second instance of perfidy, called
into action, for its defence, all his resolution. At the council-board, 
he blew out the brains of a captain of artillery who refused
the keys of the arsenal. So daring a stroke put an end to 
indecision and enkindled courage; he drew after him four thousand
men to the gate of Leogane, where a redoubt, armed with six
pieces of artillery, defended the town. Death was spread in the
ranks of the French, who advanced slowly, uncertain of the use
they should make of their arms. Soon their ardour burned up;
they rushed across the moat, threw themselves into the city, and
preserved it from the threatened conflagration.</p>
            <p>Lamartinière, less afflicted at his defeat than at not having
reduced Port-au-Prince into ashes, hastened to intrench himself
in Croix-des-Bouquets, a little to the north; a position 
surrounded by moats cut in a very hard soil. There he was waited
for by Dessalines, who had come up too late to defend the city.
That chief, who had the west under his command, was of a bold,
turbulent, and ferocious spirit; now from revenge, now from
ambition, he imbrued his hands in the blood of both white men
and black men. Hunger, thirst, fatigue, and loss of sleep he
seemed made to endure as if by a peculiarity of constitution.
His air was fierce, his step oblique, his look sanguinary. His face
<pb id="beard168" n="168"/>
furrowed with incisions, indicated the coast of Africa as his birthplace. 
Under that terrible aspect he concealed an impenetrable
dissimulation. His barbarous eloquence lay in expressive signs
rather than in words. What is strange in his destiny, is that
he was a savage, a slave, a soldier, a general, and died when an
emperor, under the dagger of a Brutus. When he learnt that
Port-au-Prince had escaped from conflagration, he turned pale,
scolded, and roared with wrath.</p>
            <p>Boudet, intending to follow up his victory, flew to Croix-des-Bouquets, 
where he was awaited by those two formidable chiefs.
But Dessalines understood his business too well to encounter the
French general in set battle array. Knowing how by bold and
rapid movements to deceive as well as escape from an enemy, he
outflanked Boudet, and getting in his rear, set on fire Leogane,
a charming city built on a promontory, before the invaders could
arrive in the vicinity. The flames which destroyed that city
rejoiced the soul of the barbarian, but did not console him for
the escape of Port-au-Prince; he meditated fresh conflagrations.</p>
            <p>While the north and the west were theatres of fire and carnage,
the east and the south submitted without the endurance of
calamity. General Kerverseau, on presenting himself before
Santo Domingo, found the inhabitants the more disposed to
receive him, because in perilous missions in Santo Domingo, he
had acquired a reputation for prudence and honour. Kerverseau
was not a great general, but a good man, modest and mild;
respected by parties, he enjoyed much popularity. Paul
L'Ouverture, who commanded the city, refused to yield
without instructions from Toussaint, his brother. Negotiations, 
nevertheless, were opened, but they came to a stop
when the news arrived that all was in flames in other parts.
Then Kerverseau invested Santo Domingo by sea and land.
Paul, meanwhile, had written for instructions to his distinguished
brother. Toussaint sent a despatch commanding him to destroy
the city if he was unable to hold it against his adversary. But
fearing the message might fall into the hands of Kerverseau, he
sent another, which recommended conciliation. These 
communications, intercepted by Spaniards who had taken sides with
<pb id="beard169" n="169"/>
the French, fell into the hands of the besieging general. 
Kerverseau conveyed to Paul the message which bore a friendly
character. Paul, importuned by the townsmen, admitted his
assailant, and joined his ranks. Thus fell Santo Domingo, and
with it there passed under the power of France a portion of
Toussaint's forces.</p>
            <p>The southern province, inhabited chiefly by mulattoes, and
being the scene of Rigaud's revolt, was not likely to offer a stern
resistance. Its commander, Laplume, no sooner heard that the
French were masters of the Cape and Port-au-Prince, than he
resolved to submit to the authority of the mother country. His
troops, mostly of his own blood, cherished no friendly recollections
toward Toussaint, by whom they had been subdued, and were
easily induced by their leader, who painted to them vividly the
evils of civil war, and read the proclamation of the Consul, whose
power, genius, and glory he extolled, to join him in taking place
side by side with the assailants of the constitutional rights of the
island. Thus, the strong points of Hayti were in the hands
of Leclerc.</p>
            <p>At the Cape and at Fort-Dauphin in the north, at Santo
Domingo in the east, at Cayes in the south, and at Port-au-Prince
in the west, the French invader had succeeded in taking up
strong positions. In vain had Toussaint L'Ouverture organised
the best resistance in his power. The enemy were on the island.
True, some of the places they held were only heaps of ruins.
Nevertheless, they had effected a landing. The island, however,
was not in their possession. Neither arms nor treachery had
subdued the natives. Toussaint well knew that the sea-ports
could not withstand so formidable an assault. But he knew also
that a country which is full of mountains is inexpugnable. For
the desultory warfare of the mountains he prepared himself, and,
backed by the population at large, men of his own blood, he
defied defeat, and felt confident that time and the climate would
unstring the arm, and lay waste the spirits as well as the frames
of his assailants. Even one advantage he had gained; for
whereas at the first, the islanders knew not whether they had to
expect peace or war, their leader, consequently, could fully 
<pb id="beard170" n="170"/>
prepare for neither; now at length the cloak was stripped off, and to
all eyes it was clear that the only alternative was victory or
servitude.</p>
            <p>On his part, Leclerc, though victorious, did not deceive 
himself with the notion of having accomplished his work. On 
the contrary, in view of the facts to which we have just adverted, 
he was aware that he had everything but the first step to accomplish. 
The Spartacus of Hayti was on his own mountains, 
supported by a whole people able and ready to resist to the utmost. 
How was Leclerc to succeed? How could a desultory warfare in 
ravines and on precipices, in recesses and in mountain fastnesses, 
be either carried on or brought to a desirable issue against what 
was not in name but literally a<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fre"> levy en masse?</foreign></hi> A different 
method must be tried. So long as Toussaint L'Ouverture was
at the head of those predatory bands, the consequences of victory
would be only a little less beneficial than those of defeat. But
treachery has power, and treachery of the basest kind was put
into action.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
            <argument>
              <p>General Leclerc opens a negotiation with Toussaint L'Ouverture by means of his 
two sons, Isaac and Placide—the negotiation ends in nothing—the French 
commander-in-chief outlaws Toussaint, and prepares for a campaign.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BEFORE he was yet informed of the success of the expedition in 
the east, the south, and the west, Leclerc, well aware that in 
Toussaint L'Ouverture he had to do with an enemy not easy to 
overcome, resolved, when now he had himself taken up a firm 
position in the north, to put into play a method of operation 
from which he expected a decisive and immediate result. 
Vincent, who foresaw the terrible wasting that the European 
troops would have to endure under the tropics, advised the Consul 
to send back, partly as hostages, and partly as mediators, the
<pb id="beard171" n="171"/>
sons of Toussaint—and so take a means for bringing the colony
into subjection, both more sure and less costly than the appeal
to arms. This advice he urged specially on the ground that as
Toussaint had strong domestic feelings, he would not be able to
stand out against the influence which the return of the young
men, after a long absence, would exert on their father in favour
of the Consul's designs. Accordingly, the Captain-General having
sent for the youths, who had remained on board the fleet, spoke
to them of the calamities which had befallen the island, urged
the necessity of a speedy accommodation, and reminded them of
the letter written to their father by the First Consul. “I have,”
he added,“the greatest hope of coming to a good understanding
with your father; he was absent; he could not command the
resistance. You must carry to him the First Consul's letter; let
him know my intentions, and the high opinion I entertain of
him.” It was somewhat late to set on foot a friendly negotiation. 
But the hour was well-timed, since the delay had given
Leclerc a footing in the island, if it had not also served, as
intended, to show Toussaint L'Ouverture the inutility of 
opposition to the will of Bonaparte, The young men felt that their
mission of peace should have preceded hostilities; but they felt,
also, a very strong desire to see their parents and their home;
nor were they wholly without a hope that even yet a pacific
arrangement might be made. They therefore gladly accepted
the embassy, and set out for Ennery, their father's dwelling-place,
accompanied by their tutor, M. Coasnon. Behind them they left
a horrible image of civil war—old men, women, children, flying
from fire and sword; everywhere alarm and consternation. Soon
they came into view of peaceful scenes, the work of their father's
genius—cultivated fields, abundant crops, happy families. There
was a land of desolation—here a land of prosperity. On their
route they saw many inhabitants, but not one soldier. As soon as
it was known who they were, crowds came out to greet them with
acclamations; they were surrounded, welcomed, embraced, and
questioned. Their object? It was to convey friendly assurances
to their father. The news was gladly heard. Nevertheless, doubt
soon resumed the ascendancy. Those were indeed the sons of
<pb id="beard172" n="172"/>
their venerated chief; they had been sent back unhurt; it was
a token for good; yet, why announce peace by cannon balls? Why
land on a friendly shore with a charge of bayonets? Along the
whole route, the same eagerness to see and welcome the youths
was displayed. Delight for a moment took the place of terror.
The family had been warned of the approach of the young men.
At last, about nine o'clock in the evening of the second day
after the departure from the Cape, their mother, accompanied by
a few friends, came with the aid of torch-light to receive them in
the midst of an immense crowd. It is more easy to conceive
than describe the tender scenes which passed that evening in the
home of Toussaint L'Ouverture. After the mother had for the
moment indulged all her emotions in regard to her sons, she turned
to their preceptor, whose care and trouble she acknowledged in
the fullest and warmest terms. All the family, for a short hour,
forgetting the common miseries of their country, gave way to the
sweetest and most joyous sentiments. Duty had prevented
Toussaint himself from taking his place in this affecting interview.
But, at eleven o'clock in the evening of the next day, the sound
of a trumpet and the rattling of horses' feet announced his
arrival. On his entrance, Isaac and Placide threw themselves
passionately on his neck. Their father long held them pressed
closely to his heart, while tears streamed down his hardy cheeks.
M. Coasnon was sent for, to whom L'Ouverture expressed the high
sense of his obligation for the attentions he had bestowed on the
young men; thanking him for having accompanied them into the
bosom of their family—though he was sorry that their arrival took
place in the midst of war, the cause of which, he said, was
unknown to him, and which he had in no way expected. Then
M. Coasnon presented to him the Consul's letter, to which was
suspended by a silk cord the state seal—the whole enclosed in a
golden casket. The epistle was as follows:—</p>

when circumstances are so happily changed, you will be the
first to pay homage to the sovereignty of the nation which counts
you in the number of her most illustrious citizens, both for the
services which you have rendered, and for the talents and force of
character with which nature has endowed you. Conduct contrary
to this would be irreconcileable with the idea which we have

which France has always felt for their happiness has often been
powerless through the imperious circumstances of war; that men
come from the continent to agitate the island and support 
factions, were the products of the factions which distracted the
mother country; that henceforth peace, and the strength of the
Government, will secure the prosperity and the freedom of the
colony. Tell them, that if to them liberty is the first of blessings,
they cannot enjoy it except as French citizens, and that every
act contrary to the interests of the mother country, to the obedience 
which they owe to the Government, and to the captain
general which is its delegate, would be a crime against the

            <p>Toussaint L'Ouverture, after running his eyes rapidly over
this compound of cajolery and menace, was about to reply, when
his sons and M. Coasnon spoke to him of the handsome reception 
they had had from the Consul, and the magnificent promises
he had made them; they also did justice in setting forth the
assurance given them by Bonaparte, that the army commanded
by Leclerc was not sent to Saint Domingo with hostile views;
adding, that it was the desire of that general to enter into an
accommodation with Toussaint L'Ouverture. Then the liberator
of Hayti said in reply: “You, M. Coasnon, you, whom I

cannonaded that city to put to sea. In the midst of so many
disasters and acts of violence, I must not forget that I wear a
sword. But, for what reason is so unjust, so impolitic a war
declared against me? Is it because I have delivered my country
from the plague of foreign and civil conflict; that with all my
power I have laboured for her prosperity and her splendour; that
I have established order and justice here? Since these actions are
<pb id="beard176" n="176"/>
regarded as a crime, why are my children sent to me, in such a
juncture, to share that crime?</p>
            <p>“As for the rest, if, as you tell me, General Leclerc frankly
desires peace, let him stop the march of his troops. He will
preserve Saint Domingo from total subversion, and will 
tranquillize minds exasperated by his system of aggression and 
invasion. I will, M. Coasnon, write him a letter having this tenour,
which you, my two children, and M. Granville, the tutor of my
younger son, shall put into his hands.”</p>
            <p>The conversation was prolonged far into the night. Toussaint
remarked on the inconsistency of recognising him as Commander-in-chief 
of Saint Domingo, at the very time that he was assailed
by an overpowering force. He could not suppress the indignation 
which he felt at the thought that his children were offered
to him as the price of his surrender. He bade M. Coasnon take
them back to General Leclerc, because, at every hazard he owed
the sacrifice of his life to the freedom of his fellow-citizens. The
father struggled with the liberator, and brought a flood of tears
from his eyes. The liberator overpowered even the father, and
exacted the sternest regard to public duty.</p>
            <p>In two days the letter was ready. On the night of February
11th, 1802, the appointed messengers were despatched with the
communication. As they travelled toward the Cape, M. Granville 
acquainted M. Coasnon with the irritation that prevailed
among the blacks. The life of the unfortunate whites hung
by a thread, and at any moment a word would be sufficient to
sunder the slender tie. In his reply, Toussaint reproached
Leclerc with having come to displace him by means of cannon
shot; with not having delivered to him the letter of the First
Consul, until three months after its date; and with having by
hostile acts rendered doubtful the rights and the services of his
colour. He declared that those rights imposed upon him duties
that were superior to those of nature; that he was prepared to
sacrifice his children to his colour, and that he sent them back
that it might not be supposed they were bound by his presence.
He ended by saying, that being more distrustful than ever, he
<pb id="beard177" n="177"/>
required time in order to decide the course which remained for
him to take.</p>
            <p>Leclerc hastened to send back the young men with a
reply, in which he invited Toussaint to come and concert with
him means for putting a stop to the public disorders, giving
him his word that the past should be sunk in oblivion, that he,
Toussaint, should be treated with the greatest distinction, and
that if he complied with the request, he should that moment be
proclaimed the first lieutenant of the Captain-general of the
colony. Leclerc finished his epistle by stating that though he
had precise instructions not to discontinue warlike operations, if
he found it necessary to commence them; yet in the hope of a
good understanding, he would condescend to an armistice of four
days, but, that delay over, he would, by a proclamation, declare
Toussaint an enemy of the French nation, and put him beyond
the pale of the law.</p>
            <p>The allurement was too weak: the threat was impotent.
Duty with Toussaint was superior to every other consideration.
He could be neither bought nor intimidated. Irritated by this
ultimatum he resolved to employ all his energies for the 
maintenance of the liberties he had achieved. Yet had he no wish
to involve his sons in the issue. He therefore, after announcing
to them his final resolution, declared that he left them free to
choose between France and their father; that he did not blame
their attachment to the mother country; but that his colour
stood between him and France; that he could not compromise
the destinies of his colour by placing himself at the mercy of an
expedition, in which figured several white generals, as well as
Rigaud, Petion, Boyer, Chanlatte and others, all his personal
enemies; that the order not to cease from fighting to negotiate,
showed that France had more confidence in its arms than in
its rights; that a confidence of such a nature indicated the
despotism of mere force, and that if no practical regard was paid
to the rights of the blacks, while they had some power, what
would their condition be when he and his should be powerless?</p>
            <p>His sons threw themselves into his arms, imploring him to
yield. Their tears and their caresses failed to move him.
<pb id="beard178" n="178"/>
Remaining inflexible, he merely repeated, “My children, make
your choice; whatever it is, I shall always love you.” At
length his own son Isaac, detaching himself from his father's
arms, exclaimed, “Well, behold in me a faithful servant of
France, who can never resolve to bear arms against her.”
Placide, Isaac's uterine brother, manifested indecision. Toussaint,
petrified, gave his paternal benediction to Isaac, whom he gently
put away from him, Meanwhile Placide, overpowered, threw
himself on his father's neck, and sobbing said, “I am yours,
father; I fear the future, I fear slavery; I am ready to fight
against it; I renounce France.” Immediately L'Ouverture 
invested him with the command of a battalion of his guard,
whom a few days after he led against the invaders. With all
Toussaint's affection for his own son, Isaac, he was unable to
bring himself to offer the least opposition to his joining the
French. A mother's tenderness, however, knows no claims but
those of natural affection, and impelled by that powerful sentiment, 
Toussaint's wife succeeded in causing Isaac to change his
determination. The young man wrote that he was prevented
from returning to the Cape by his mother's urgent entreaties.</p>
            <p>This scene, which was reported to Leclerc, sufficed to prove to
him the failure of the device by which the parents were to be
enslaved through their attachment to their children. Most 
unworthy purpose! What a terrible thing is war! How blind
is ambition! A thirst for self-aggrandisement, when supported
by power and sustained by position, confounds right and wrong,
desecrates the holy, disowns moral obligation, and spreads wasting
and woe through families, cities and nations.</p>
            <p>Further attempts at accommodation were made. Toussaint
offered to prevent resistance, if Leclerc would communicate to
him the instructions he had received from the First Consul,
and stop the advance of the French troops. Toussaint added,
that should Leclerc continue to press forward, he would repel
him by force of arms. A deputation of the natives waited on
the French commander. To their solicitations, Leclerc insolently
replied, that he was the brother-in-law of the First Consul, that
he had the bayonets on his side, and that he would take Toussaint
<pb id="beard179" n="179"/>
before he had his boots off. Full of himself, and fancying that 
he was about to become the Bonaparte of America, he issued 
to the inhabitants of Saint Domingo the following 
proclamation!—</p>

            <argument>
              <p>General Leclerc advances against Toussaint with 25,000 men in three divisions,
intending to overwhelm him near Gonaïves—the plan is disconcerted by a
check given by Toussaint to General Rochambeau in the ravine Couleuvre.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE Captain-general of the French army, having mustered all
his disposable forces in the north, and received a reinforcement
of seven thousand men, commenced operations in three divisions,
amounting in all to five-and-twenty thousand men. One
division, commanded by General Rochambeau, set out from Fort
Dauphin to march to Saint Michel; the second, led by Desfourneaux, 
advanced from Limbé to occupy Plaisance; and the third,
under General Hardy, marching to the centre, went to take
possession of Marmelade. These three divisions were, together
with Boudet, who was to proceed from Port-au-Prince, to effect
a junction at Gonaïves, in order to surprise Toussaint in his head
quarters there, and put a speedy termination to the war. In
proportion as the French army forced its way into the interior
of the country, which was broken by mountains, gorges, and
defiles, the conflict became more and more difficult. The soldiers
were vexed and harassed at having to do with a flying enemy,
who, constantly fighting in ambush, inflicted wounds or death as
if from an invisible cause, with perfect impunity to themselves,
whether from the speed with which they fled into well-known
retreats, or from the height of the mountains, on which the sun
burnt with a heat intolerable to Europeans. In these marches,
which were rather difficult than long, the soldiers suffered
from hunger, thirst, and extreme lassitude; and after the perils
and penalties of the ocean, they found on the land, instead of
repose or glory, a warfare in which victory brought no honour,
and defeat entailed deep disgrace; and in which victory was
purchased by intolerable endurance, and defeat was made afflicting 
by contempt for the foe, and disastrous by the revenge which
that foe could on his own soil so easily take. In quitting Fort
<pb id="beard182" n="182"/>
Dauphin, Rochambeau traversed the country called Ouanaminthe,
passed round the north of La Grande Rivière, climbed the black
mountain of Gonaïves, and descended towards the savannahs of
La Desolée.</p>
            <p>The division commanded by Desfourneaux took possession of
the district of Plaisance, which was treacherously delivered to
him by its commander without striking a blow.</p>
            <p>The division under Hardy scaled and captured the formidable
position at Boispin, and carried at the point of the bayonet
Marmelade, which was defended by Christophe.</p>
            <p>The theatre of the war lay accordingly on the chain of the
mountains which separates the north from the west, and which
overtop the heights of Dondon, Vallière, and the black mountain
of Gonaïves. In those places Toussaint had concentrated his
inferior army in order to prevent the French, who had landed
on three points of the coast, from concerting their operations,
and from surrounding his own troops, overwhelming him at once
with all their sea and land forces.</p>
            <p>The situation of Toussaint had become perilous, environed as
he was on all sides by advancing foes. The peril, however, was
neither unexpected nor unprovided for. Rochambeau was near
Lacroix, lying in the mountains in a line between Esther and
Gonaïves. In order to descend into the plains he must pass
through the ravine Couleuvre. This ravine was a narrow gorge
flanked by precipitous mountains, covered with wood, and which
swarmed with aimed black labourers.</p>
            <p>Rochambeau, by a movement in this direction, seemed likely
to effect great results. He might render himself master of the
person of Madame Toussaint, of her sister and her two nieces,
who had just arrived at Lacroix. He might also cut off 
Toussaint's connexion with Dessalines and Belair, and so bring the
contest to an end by one blow. It was then necessary for
Toussaint to prevent the advance of Rochambeau, unless he was
willing to be the next morning attacked by all Leclerc's
army, in a semicircle, of which the coast, off which lay vessels
of war, would have been the diameter. Leaving General Vernet,
therefore, in command of his troops at Gonaïves, he put himself
<pb id="beard183" n="183"/>
at the head of a squadron and of the grenadier battalion of his
guard, and marched to his habitation at Lacroix. Not finding
his wife and family on his arrival, he inquired where they were,
and at what distance Rochambeau might be. He could learn
nothing more exact than that at the news of the enemy's
approach, the ladies had sought shelter in the forest. Toussaint
having surveyed the district, made his arrangements for attack.
To stop or retard the foe, he closed the defile with trees that
were felled and thrown across the narrow path. In the flanks
of the two mountains he placed ambuscades, that were to fall on
the French on their sides and in their rear, at the same time that
he would assail them in front, thus surrounding them every way.
For fear of being discovered he lighted no fire during the night.
Accompanied by one of his aide-de-camps and two labourers, he
went forward to reconnoitre. One of his guides having pushed
on venturously, fell into the midst of an outpost belonging to
Rochambeau. Captured, he was put to death without being
able even by a cry to warn Toussaint of the proximity of his foes.
Having learned all he could, that general rejoined his band, gave
orders for battle, and addressed to the soldiers the following
speech:—</p>
            <p>“You are going to fight against enemies who have neither
faith, law, nor religion. They promise you liberty, they intend
your servitude. Why have so many ships traversed the ocean,
if not to throw you again into chains? They disdain to recognise
in you submissive children, and if you are not their slaves, you
are rebels. The mother country, misled by the Consul, is no
longer anything for you but a step-mother. Was there ever a
defence more just than yours? Uncover your breasts, you will
see them branded by the iron of slavery. During ten years,
what did you not undertake for liberty? Your masters slain or
put to flight; the English humiliated by defeat; discord 
extinguished; a land of slavery purified by fire, and reviving more
beautiful than ever under liberty; these are your labours, and
these the fruits of your labours; and the foe wishes to snatch
both out of your hands. Already have you left traces of
your despair; but for a traitor, Port-au-Prince would be only
<pb id="beard184" n="184"/>
heap of ruins; but Léogane, Fort-Dauphin, the Cape, that
opulent capital of the Antilles, exist no longer; you have carried
everywhere consuming fires, the flambeaux of our liberty. The
steps of our enemies have trodden only on ashes, their eyes have
encountered nothing but smoking ruins, which you have watered
with their blood. This is the road by which they have come to
us. What do they hope for? Have we not all the presages of
victory? Not for their country, not for liberty do they fight,
but to serve the hatred and the ambition of the Consul, my
enemy, mine because he is yours; their bodies are not mutilated
by the punishments of servitude, their wives and their children
are not near their camps, and the graves of their fathers are
beyond the ocean. This sky, these mountains, these lands, all are
strange to them? What do I say? As soon as they breathe the
same air as we, their bravery sinks, their courage departs.
Fortune seems to have delivered them as victims into our hands.
Those whom the sword spares, will be struck dead by an avenging 
climate. Their bones will be scattered among these mountains 
and rocks, and tossed about by the waves of our sea. Never
more will they behold their native land; never more will they
receive the tender embraces of their wives, their sisters, and
their mothers; and liberty will reign over their tomb.”</p>
            <p>On his side, Rochambeau, too much accustomed to treat the
Africans with pride and contempt, nevertheless thought it prudent
to encourage his men by telling them that this day would raise
their glory to the highest pitch, since there would be no part of
the world which would not be a witness of their triumph; that
the Tiber, the Nile, and the Rhine, where they had conquered
very formidable adversaries, resounded with the echoes of their
exploits; that now they had to combat slaves, who, not daring
to look them in the face, were flying on all hands; and that
they had not come thousands of miles from home to be overcome
by a rebellious slave.</p>
            <p>As soon as the day broke, Toussaint's advanced guard, in
passing a river, encountered the advanced guard of Rochambeau,
which was on its march. Then the action began. The impetuosity 
of the attack was checked by the bravery of the resistance<corr>.</corr>
<pb id="beard185" n="185"/>
The troops in ambush pressed forward on the flanks and in the
rear of the French, who everywhere presented a bold front to the
assailants. The retrenchment having been opened, the conflict
became bloody and obstinate. Now the victory inclined to
this side, now to that. The uncertainty did but inflame the
courage of both. Toussaint was then seen to brave a thousand
perils. Some of his grenadiers yielding a little before the French
impetuosity, a young officer called back their powers by these
words, “What! you desert your general!” That moment he put
himself at the head of a platoon of grenadiers, and ascending an
eminence which commanded Rochambeau's right wing, annoyed
him with a destructive fire. At this moment an officer of
dragoons having informed Toussaint that his wife and family
were behind a mountain not far from the place of action; he
replied, “Do you see that they take the road to Esther; I must
here perform my duty.” His duty he did perform. Regardless
of himself, he encouraged his men when they vacillated, and
ever again led them into the fight. With such fury did the
conflict rage that arms were thrown aside, and combatants,
seizing each other, struggled for life and death. The field of
battle was covered with the slain. A decisive effort was necessary. 
Putting himself at the head of his grenadiers, Toussaint
rushed to the attack, and drove Rochambeau over the river,
where, in the morning, the fight had begun. He then returned,
and took up a position on his side of the stream.</p>
            <p>The issue remained undecided, but Toussaint had rescued his
family and stopped the impetuous career of Rochambeau. He
had also gained time, while Christophe, by a vigorous defence,
retarded the advance of Desfourneaux and of Hardy. Thus had
he saved himself from being surrounded on the plain of Gonaïves.
Like a man of genius, he had chosen the place and the time of
the combat, and in a crisis obtained great advantages.</p>
            <p>Retiring toward his centre, Toussaint pitched his camp on the
banks of the Esther. There, surrounded by his soldiers and his
family, and covered with a cloak, he had only a plank on which
to sit and to sleep. He passed the greater part of the night in
despatching orders written with his own hand, and in going
<pb id="beard186" n="186"/>
from post to post. The next day he sent his wife and family to
the mountain known by the name of Grand Cahos, which runs
in a line with the Artibonite. His visit to Esther, however, was
only for a temporary purpose. He was too good a soldier to
meet the concentrated forces of the enemy in a level country,
where, with all his valour, he would not have been able to 
prevent his comparatively diminutive army from being crushed.
His ability to offer any effectual resistance had arisen from the
judgment he had employed in making the mountains the seat of
the warfare. Justified in this policy by the success which he
had gained, he determined to <sic corr="evacuate">evacute</sic> Esther, and to collect
troops in another mountainous stronghold, still more favourable
than that in which he had defeated Rochambeau.</p>
            <p>A review of the operations of Toussaint L'Ouverture, from the
point at which our narrative has arrived, shows that the method
of his warfare consisted in passive or active resistance, which,
after spreading fire and devastation before the enemy's march,
withdrew from the coast and made the mountains its centre and
its bulwark. That this plan was carefully weighed and well
laid out, may be presumed from a knowledge of Toussaint's
character. It was also carried into effect as thoroughly as 
circumstances permitted. If in any respect it failed, the failure
was owing to no remissness on the part of the great chief. The
following letters written by him at the beginning of the 
campaign, may serve to illustrate and confirm these observations,
and may conduce to the reader's acquaintance with the character
of our hero.</p>

            <argument>
              <p>Toussaint L'Ouverture prepares Crête-à-Pierrot as a point of resistance against
Leclerc; who, mustering his forces, besieges the redoubt, which, after the
bravest defence, is evacuated by the blacks.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE district into which Toussaint L'Ouverture had sent his
family was that to which he meant to transfer his resistance.
The mountain range which he resolved to occupy and entrench,
<pb id="beard189" n="189"/>
bears the name of Artibonite, and is divided into two districts,
the one called the Grand Cahos, the other the Petit Cahos.
These mountains, over which he spread his army, are intersected
with deep ravines and precipitous outlets, at every one of which
a handful of brave men could arrest an army. The 
principal entrance was defended by Crête-à-Pierrot, a redoubt which
blocked up the pass, and which the English had constructed
when they invaded the west.</p>
            <p>In passing toward the new seat of war, where he was joined
by his chief generals, Toussaint was suddenly attacked with a
burning fever. His mind, however, so far mastered his body,
that he scarcely abated his activity, and formed designs of the
greatest daring, in making arrangements for attacking the
enemy in the rear. Ill as he was, he set out to survey the 
district, and arrived in time to prevent the demolition of Crête-à-Pierrot, 
which had been abandoned, and which Dessalines had
ordered to be rased. He then proceeded to add to its strength.
He supplied it with water and food, as precautions against a
siege. He placed in it a garrison, and gave the command to
Dessalines. Having called the officers together, he harangued
them thus:—“Children, yes, you are all my children—from
Lamartinière, who is white as a white, but who knows that he
has negro blood in his veins, to Monpoint, whose skin is the
same as mine:—I entrust to you this post; take measures for its
defence.” The officers declared that he might rely on them,
living or dead.</p>
            <p>To more destructive hands than those of Dessalines, this
important post could not have been confided. In his retreat,
that ferocious monster had dragged away from their homes all
the whites he could seize, whom the sword and the musket had
spared. These were conducted to Verettes, Mirebalais, and
Petite Rivière, towns lying along the banks of the Artibonite.
There were renewed the frightful scenes of the first insurrection.
At the sight of the conflagration which reduced into ashes the
villages and the fields, at the foot of Mount Cahos, where
Toussaint had entrenched himself, a vast carnage was made of
the whites. Four hundred men were massacred at Mirebalais
<pb id="beard190" n="190"/>
and Petite Rivière. In no place was the slaughter so terrible as
at the village of Verettes. At the nod of Dessalines, men who
had been slaves, and who dreaded the new servitude with which
they were threatened, slew seven hundred of the poor wretches
that Dessalines had dragged after him. The daughter breathed
her last on the bosom of her expiring mother. The father was
unable to save the son; the son was unable to save the father.
There a sister died in the arms of a brother; here a nurse tried
to make her body a means of defence for her infant; her milk
and her blood flowed in one stream. Farther on, old men in
vain implored pity from their former slaves, whom they called
on by name, to bring back the remembrance of past acts of
kindness. Whole families were thus bathed in blood. More
frightful and more atrocious still was the sight when sons slew
their fathers, thus revenging themselves for the black blood of
their mothers, and the neglect and disavowal of their fathers.
So great was the fury of the blacks and mulattoes, that they
even wreaked their rage on domestic animals which belonged to
the planters. Thus the banks of the Artibonite were covered
with fire and blood. Before the arrival of the French expedition
all there was peaceful, prosperous and happy.</p>
            <p>The French felt deep compassion when on coming up they
beheld at Verettes so many victims who still remained unburied,
and who retained the attitudes in which they perished, as if to
paint an awful picture of the evils of slavery. They there saw
the arm of one victim locked in that of another, hand grasped
in hand, faces fixed on the same object; father, mother, children
grouped together, a family even in death; young women who
in the last moments forgot not they were women; bodies which
had served as useless ramparts to friendship, and to filial and
paternal love: the scenes were horrible. Nor was their horror
abated by the fact that ravages scarcely less atrocious had been
committed by the white invaders. A little before, the bay of
Mancenille had smoked with innocent blood. And on more
than one occasion had prisoners been slain in bands, in order
to strike alarm into the defenders of their native soil. All the
blacks, however, were not barbarians. Many, moved by pity or
<pb id="beard191" n="191"/>
gratitude, saved the lives of unfortunate colonists; some concealed
them in the mountains, and supported them by what they took 
in hunting; others led them through <sic corr="by">bye</sic> paths, into districts 
occupied by the French. There were blacks who, to prevent 
suspicion on the part of pursuers, covered their white friends 
with leaves and branches, and counterfeited drunkenness when 
they thought there was special danger of discovery. Calamities 
public and private so numerous and so terrible were more than 
human strength could endure, and under their pressure some 
persons lost their reason and others committed suicide. What 
a complication of sorrows, all caused by slavery!</p>
            <p>Having provided for the defence of the country of the Artibonite,
and directed Belair to occupy the mountains of Verettes, 
Toussaint proceeded to execute his daring plan of taking Leclerc in 
the rear in order to operate a diversion in favour of the Artibonite 
lines, and to reanimate the courage of the north. With a small 
but resolute force Toussaint ascended the defiles, and the chain 
of mountains which separate the Artibonite from the district of 
Saint Michel. In vain was General Hardy detached in pursuit 
of him by Leclerc, whose army was in movement to attack 
Crête-à-Pierrot. Toussaint appeared at Ennery, and the French 
garrison which Leclerc had left there fled at his approach to 
Gonaïves. He presented himself before Gonaïves, and might 
have captured it had he chosen. He was satisfied with alarming
the garrison, which was on the point of embarking on board a 
frigate that was in the roads. Having attained his end he 
returned to Ennery where he organized battalions of militia, who 
were employed to guard and defend the country. This work 
finished, he betook himself to Marmelade. There he sent an 
order to Christophe, who was at Petite-Rivière, to return 
promptly into the north, where, in the forest of Grande-Rivière, 
there had, without the French being aware of it, been formed 
a considerable depôt of arms and ammunition. From Marmelade 
Toussaint went to Plaisance. On his arrival he proceeded to 
reconnoitre a fort situated on a height. A few hours after, he 
placed himself at the head of two companies of grenadiers and 
captured it. The following day he divided his troops into two
<pb id="beard192" n="192"/>
bodies. Taking the command of the right wing, he marched
to meet Desfourneaux, who was coming up to attack him. He
bore up against the impetuosity of the French troops, who were
much more numerous than his own, and at length succeeded in
putting them to flight. Sending in the moment of action an
aide-de-camp to learn how things went on in the left wing, he
was led to believe that Desfourneaux was manœuvring so as to
circumvent him. Thereupon he left the right to the care of
Colonel Gabarre, and with a few men hurried to the point of
danger. Among the European troops he recognised the uniform
of the ninth Saint Domingo regiment. Advancing quite alone
to within five or six paces of the regiment, which easily 
recognised their proper commander, he said, “Soldiers of the ninth,
will you dare fire on your general and on your brethren?” The
words fell like a thunder-clap on the soldiers; who forthwith
were on their knees, and, but for the European troops, who began
to fire, they would have joined Toussaint. Seeing the peril of
their general, Toussaint's forces defended him against the 
Europeans. He escaped through the thick of a fire which was very
destructive. A young officer, bearing a letter from Dessalines
to the Governor of the island, received a mortal blow at the
moment that he delivered it, and expired in Toussaint's arms.
From that letter the General-in-chief learned that his aid was 
urgently required at Crête-à-Pierrot; thither therefore he repaired.</p>
            <p>The French had been drawing their strength under the foot
of the mountains of Cahos. As they made their way they beheld
the ravages committed by the enemy. Traces of fire and death
appeared everywhere. Here and there they met a great number
of colonists wandering in the woods and hanging on the sides of the
rocks, with their wives and children, having escaped from death
only by chance or flight. The soldiers restored to them hope,
and promised them revenge. The sight of these unhappy people,
whose clothes were in rags, their cries, their moanings, the 
horror with which they were stricken, inflamed the minds of their
rescuers, and prepared them for any atrocities. Without scruple
and without pity they massacred the herds of blacks whom the
fate of war had thrown into their hands; two hundred they 
<pb id="beard193" n="193"/>
immolated at the fort of Mount Nolo; a little further on, six hundred
fell beneath their murderous hands. Thus carnage was added to
carnage, and black blood flowed to avenge white blood. The
savage and torn sides of Mount Cahos, the odorous banks of the
Artibonite, offered the spectacle of barbarity opposed to 
barbarity, and war was only prolonged assassination. These are
the horrible devastations of slavery.</p>
            <p>No graves were dug, no mounds were raised for sepulture.
Dessalines had prohibited interment, in order that the eyes of
his assailants might see his vengeance even in the repulsive 
remains of carnage. It is said that the monster slew a mother for
having buried her son. The French, carried away by the 
movements of the war, gave no attention to the religious duty of
burial, so that the dead bodies became food for dogs, vultures
and crocodiles; and their bones, partly calcined by the sun,
remained scattered about, as if to mark the mournful fury of
servitude and lust of power.</p>
            <p>Fortune seemed to smile on Leclerc. He lost no time in
announcing to his brother-in-law his success, which he failed not
to exaggerate—entire battalions that had joined his ranks, the
two provinces of the South and the East subdued, all the 
maritime cities in his power,—such were the heads of his triumphant
report. He described Toussaint L'Ouverture as a party-chief,
sullen, violent, fanatical, hateful, breathing only fire and slaughter; 
he called him a barbarian, an unnatural father, sacrificing
his children to his passion for revolt, a mere fugitive slave,
devoured by remorse, abandoned and pursued. This news,
which gave the consul joy, delighted the colonists who had
remained in France, and revived the cupidity of the slave-dealers
whose vessels had for six years remained in harbour unproductive.</p>
            <p>When however Bonaparte began seriously to reflect on all
that had taken place, his satisfaction was not a little diminished.
It was true that he held under his domination, the South rich in
manufactures, and the East fertile in pasturage. But what had
he conquered? Lands in ashes. Port-au-Prince had miraculously
escaped from the incendiary torch. But what a sight in other
parts! Those barbarians do not place the keys of their cities at
<pb id="beard194" n="194"/>
the feet of their conquerors. Toussaint, designated a bandit, is
a formidable general in his mountains. The consul applies
himself to study that remarkable man. He is the soul of
the war, and him he must reach, seize, and put in chains.
That accomplished, what then? He must attach to himself the
men of mixed blood, who are already partly his. Then discord
must be disseminated. The black in revolt will be overcome by
the subjugated black. This was the consul's policy. These were
his means for bringing the island into subjection. To this
purpose, and for these results, he wrote to Leclerc. But suddenly
the war took a new aspect.</p>
            <p>Twelve thousand men, the bravest soldiers of the republic,
are assembled near Petite-Rivière to put down a revolted
slave! Rochambeau, Hardy, Debelle, generals of great skill
and high powers, are stopped in a ravine by a handful of revolted
slaves! their passage is barred, their valour rendered nugatory
by a few men whom they despise! officers and soldiers who have
gained victory and renown against the first troops of Europe,
perish in huge numbers under the blows of half-civilized blacks.
So much do the issues of war depend on opportunity; so dear
is freedom; so odious is servitude.</p>
            <p>The first division which came up to the attack of Crête-à-Peirrot 
was that of Debelle. As soon as the French troops were
seen in the redoubt, Dessalines opened the gates. “The gates
have been opened,” he said, “for those who do not feel themselves
courageous enough to die; while there is yet time, let the friends
of the French depart; they have nothing but death to look for
here.” After having sent away all whom sickness or fear made
desirous of going, he spread a train of gunpowder as far as the
first gate, and seizing a torch, exclaimed, “Now for the first fire:
I will blow up the fort, if you do not defend it.” During these
things the French were advancing, preceded by a herald (4th
March 1802). The herald held a letter in his hand. Dessalines
ordered his men to fire. The herald fell dead. Firing began on
both sides in real earnest. For several hours it continued without
an interval. The French rushed forward with their usual
bravery and enthusiasm, but it was only to meet death. The
<pb id="beard195" n="195"/>
moment they were within reach, the batteries were opened and
the ground was strewed with dead. The general-in-chief Debelle
was grievously wounded, as well as Brigadier-general Devaux.
The division was compelled to fall back with the loss of four
hundred men.</p>
            <p>This defeat deeply affected the mind of Leclerc, who was then
at Port-au-Prince. Was his victorious career, then, to be delayed
by a single stronghold? Not without apprehension he hastened to
the scene of action. He brought with him the division of
Boudet. While the troops were assembling, a scout of Toussaint's,
in his zeal to ascertain all he could, entered their camp, pretending 
to be a deserter. In the midst of his guard, General Boudet
questioned the man. When the former asked him how many
whites he had put to death, the latter, with well feigned fear,
appeared overwhelmed. In the twinkling of an eye, having
learnt the condition of the French, he leapt from his horse.
Boudet, the first to observe the movement, attempted to seize
him, and had his thumb nearly bitten off. The man got away,
slipped beneath the horse's legs, overthrew the soldiers who
attempted to stop him, ran toward the Artibonite, plunged into
the stream, and escaped amid a shower of balls. Arrived on
the opposite bank, he appeared to have been struck, for he fell as
if his thigh were broken. The presence on the other side of the
river of a reconnoitring party of the foe prevented pursuit. The
black scout, who had the rank of captain, appears to have been
carried off by his friends.</p>
            <p>Among the troops which now advanced to the attack, there
were Rigaud and Pétion. True to his instructions, Leclerc
added to the skill of his white soldiers the fury and the animosity
of mulatto blood.</p>
            <p>In the interval which had elapsed since the first attack,
Dessalines had erected a new fort on an eminence which 
commanded that on which stood the famous Crête-à-Pierrot. The
new redoubt, though hastily constructed, was to witness the
defeat of the consul's boastful brother-in-law.</p>
            <p>The French in advancing surprised a camp of blacks who
were asleep. They fell on them; the blacks ran toward the fort
<pb id="beard196" n="196"/>
and the French pursued them. Those who could not enter the
fort threw themselves into the moat. Immediately the fort
opened its fire and mowed down the assailants. General Boudet
received a wound. At the moment when his division was on
the point of perishing that of Dugua came up. Forthwith that
general was struck. Only one general officer kept the field.
Then the blacks rushed to the charge. The French retreated.
In the retreat, Leclerc himself, who came up with reinforcements,
received a serious contusion. This second attack cost the
captain-general eight hundred men.</p>
            <p>In their retrograde movement the Europeans had opportunities
of ascertaining how entirely the population was in enmity against
them. On the plantations they saw the labourers watching
their movements. Those labourers exchanged shots with the
soldiers who flanked the column. If a party of scouts were
detached, they fled; as soon as the scouts retired, they re-appeared.
The French army inspired only terror.</p>
            <p>A third attack was to be made. The stronghold was 
regularly invested. Fresh troops had come up. All that ability,
experience, labour and prowess could contribute was set in
vigorous action.</p>
            <p>While the operations for the blockade were proceeding, the
French soldiers heard from the strongholds the words of the
very songs to which they had themselves marched against the
enemies of liberty in Europe. The effect was singular and
deep. “What! those black men the injured, and we the 
injurers! those black men the oppressed, and we the oppressors!
Are we then no longer the servants and patrons of liberty? The
republic gives freedom; we are fighting for servitude.” Such
impressions were little likely to increase the efficiency of 
republican soldiers. Their duty they would continue to do, but
services higher than a mere sense of duty can command were now
required.</p>
            <p>By degrees, the works were completed and brought into
play against the redoubt. Partial successes were obtained.
Encouraged by these, Rochambeau thought himself able to carry
a battery, which he had for a moment silenced, by one blow.
<pb id="beard197" n="197"/>
He lost three hundred men in the useless attempt. Then a
constant cannonade was commenced. From the 22nd to the
24th of March, it was carried on with great activity. The redoubt
was in the greatest peril.</p>
            <p>At this time a black man and a black woman were 
captured. Suspected to be spies, they were subjected to the
severest punishment. The man said he was blind; nothing but
the whites of his eyes were to be seen. Only in leaning on the
aged negress, his companion, did he appear able to walk. She
affected to be deaf. Scarcely any thing but groans and sobs
could the cruellest treatment extort from them. At length,
compassion prevailed. They were bid go about their business.
They had dreadfully suffered, and seemed unable to move. Not
before they were threatened to be shot, did they attempt to
walk. They were conducted beyond the outlying sentinels.
When fairly out of the reach of their enemies, they began to
dance; and instantly darted off for the fort, where they were
received. They conveyed to its commander intelligence of the
approach of Toussaint L'Ouverture.</p>
            <p>That very night (March 24) an attack was made on the French
lines which was repulsed only with difficulty and loss. That
attack was led by Toussaint himself, who had conceived a project
worthy of his own genius. Having reason to think the north
could for some time give him no more trouble, and afraid lest
Crête-à-Pierrot might be carried by storm, he hastened to the
Artibonite, intending with a few trusty soldiers to penetrate to
Leclerc's head quarters, make him prisoner and ship him off to
France. To aid him in his daring plan, a feint was made in the
attack of which we have just spoken. And the captured 
fugitives were sent to encourage the garrison to hold out.</p>
            <p>The stratagem was too late. Lamartinière, who had taken
the command, with his accustomed bravery had done and endured
everything that man can do and endure. With his soldiers he
patiently bore hunger, thirst, sickness, exhaustion, and the 
prospect of death at any moment. With their aid, he performed
prodigies of heroism. But stone-walls are not proof against
cannon balls and bombs. The forts were defended against
<pb id="beard198" n="198"/>
thousands of brave Frenchmen, even when falling into ruins.
But the hour at length came. Then, when resistance was vain,
the commander resolved to cut himself a passage through the
ranks of his enemies. He escaped from the hands of 12,000
men, not having lost half his garrison, and leaving to his
assailants only the dead and the wounded amid a heap of ruins.</p>

              <p>Shattered condition of the French army—Dark prospects of Toussaint—Leclerc opens negotiations for peace—wins over Christophe and Dessalines—offers to recognise Toussaint as Governor-General—receives his submission on 
condition of preserving universal freedom—L'Ouverture in the quiet of his home.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>DEARLY had the reduction of Crête-à-Pierrot been bought by
the French. The loss deeply afflicted the captain-general, who
induced his subordinates to make it appear as slight as possible,
remembering the contemptuous terms in which he had spoken
of Toussaint and his forces, and well dreading the moral effect
on the inhabitants of the island.</p>
            <p>After the capture of this stronghold, Leclerc took measures
for re-establishing his communications. He ordered Rochambeau's 
division to open them by forming a junction at Gonaïves
with Desfourneaux; and directed Hardy with his forces to make
for the Cape. The latter division were compelled to form for
themselves a road with their arms in their hands. Under the
impression that the invaders had suffered a total defeat, Hardy
had with him only bands of fugitives who hastened to the Cape
in order to fly by sea from the island, while on the whole line of
his march, he encountered opposition from regular troops or
armed labourers. But for the courage of the soldiers who were
kept under discipline, and the judgment and energy of the
<pb id="beard199" n="199"/>
commanders, the whole division would have perished. From
four to five hundred men were lost on the route.</p>
            <p>While the divisions of Rochambeau and Hardy proceeded
toward the north, that of Boudet, under the command of General
Lacroix, was commanded to return to Saint Marc, in order to
attack Belair, who up to that time had remained in observation
on the heights of Matheux, which stand to the south-east of that
post, between it and Mount Cahos. We give a report of the
undertaking in the words of its leader.</p>
            <p>“We climbed the heights by the sources of Mount Ronis. I
had often heard speak of a ‘carabined road;’ but I was, I avow,
far from forming an idea of the obstacles which I had to overcome 
in order to open the carabined road of Matheux. Yet
was I expert in work of the kind, having a year before opened
the passage of Splugen. In the memorable campaign of the
army of reserve, I had also traced round fort Bard, routes on
peaked mountains declared impassable. I had conveyed cannon
by those roads, thus executing an enterprise till then regarded
as impossible. That path round fort Bard threw down the
barrier which stood against the fortune of the first consul; by
that road the army of reserve gained the plains of Piedmont and
reconquered Italy on the field of Marengo. Precipices and road
accidents are every where the same; but in the Alps the bush-wood 
is at least accessible, and the trees are of a determinate
height, while in America the former are fine mountains and the
latter colossal masses which you can scarcely take in in one
view, and which you can displace only by strength of arm and
length of time. I doubt whether I could have been able to gain
the plateau of Matheux, if Belair had added the efforts of his 
resistance to the obstacles of the locality in which he was.</p>
            <p>“After the most fatiguing march, I at last arrived at Matheux.
Belair had quitted the plain the previous evening to join 
Dessalines on Mount Cahos.</p>
            <p>“I wrote to him, suggesting that he should imitate the examples
of Generals Clervaux, Paul L'Ouverture, and Maurepas, and
announcing that I was authorized by the captain-general to
guarantee to him and to his officers their military rank. He
<pb id="beard200" n="200"/>
answered that he blindly followed the authority of Toussaint
L'Ouverture, recognised governor for life, by the constitution of
the colony, and by his numberless services, which France seemed
disposed to disown.</p>
            <p>“The lofty position of Matheux presented to us the aspect
of the champaign lands of France; we there found its 
atmosphere; the lungs of our soldiers dilated; we were agile; on the
contrary, the blacks, whom we had as auxiliaries, wore a shrunk
appearance. In the different gorges of the mountain, we 
delivered from five to six hundred persons who had fled thither
from Saint Marc and the neighbouring lands. Hardy and
Rochambeau had set at large a thousand fugitives in Mount
Cahos.</p>
            <p>“I collected on Matheux a large number of horses, mules, and
horned cattle, which Belair had got together. Two days after, I
began to march toward Port-au-Prince. A letter was brought
me from General Boudet, who, directing me to conduct his 
division to that city, requested that I would make a processional 
entrance into it, and that in so doing, I should make the troops 
appear as numerous as possible, in order to efface from the minds of
the men of colour in the West the impressions they had received
as to the extent of our loss. I put the troops into two ranks; our
sections marched at great distances; all our officers were on
horseback; artillery ready for the field was sent to meet me; I
distributed it in the column with the baggage; and our entrance
produced the moral effect which we expected.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref13" n="13" rend="sc" target="note13">*</ref></p>

            <p>Nothing can more clearly show the valorous resistance made
by Toussaint L'Ouverture than the frank confessions made by
this respectable writer of the disorganized and weakened 
condition of the French troops after the capture of Crête-à-Pierrot.
Scarcely able to keep the field or effect a retrograde movement,
the decimated and shattered armies of Leclerc could not be
allowed, except when tricked out in this fashion, to return to the
capital of the island. What impudence, then, was that which
described the great African leader as a mere chief of banditti!
<pb id="beard201" n="201"/>
and what did that leader want but the support of some
European power, friendly to human freedom, in order to
establish on a permanent basis that constitution which had
been so wisely constructed, and that liberty which had been
purchased at so large a price, and of which the Haytian negroes
had proved themselves so worthy? Alas! such a friendly power
did not exist. England and the United States were both
committed to the support of slavery; and the great war of the
African world had to be fought out by Toussaint alone. Well
was the conflict sustained, and though the immediate result was
adverse, the strife, we trust, will not have to be renewed. If
the plains, the mountains, and the ravines of Saint Domingo say
nothing effectually on behalf of negro rights, surely they cry
with so loud a voice, declaring the horrors of a war of “bloods,”
that even fear will suffice to break the bonds of the slave!</p>
            <p>From the ruins and carnage of Crête-à-Pierrot, L'Ouverture
hastened to the recesses of Mount Cahos, whither he had ordered
the brave defenders of that post to follow him. They, as well
as he, needed a few days' repose. And there, where he had for
some time formerly dwelt, he met his wife and family, and in
their society enjoyed a short tranquillity. Of this brief
leisure, he availed himself to write to Bonaparte, in order to 
explain to him the conduct of General Leclerc and to ask him to
send another to take his place, into whose hands he might resign
the command of the island.</p>
            <p>This was an hour for calm reflection Toussaint L'Ouverture
did not let slip. Thoughtful by nature, he now by the force of
circumstances was drawn to the consideration of his past career
and his present position. He had effected much. At one
time, he thought he had achieved the permanent freedom of'
his colour. But alas! the constitution had not been ratified.
In defence of that solemn national act, he had not only again
and again risked his life and nearly forfeited all he possessed,
but he had given many a severe lesson to its assailants, and
taught them to respect and fear a man whom they disgracefully
attempted to enslave. Yet amid these triumphs, the final
success of his undertaking seemed now to recede into distant
<pb id="beard202" n="202"/>
mists. The present was dark and gloomy. Leclerc, with
shattered forces, was still strong, and should the army now under
his command be annihilated, it could easily be replaced by the
inexhaustible resources of France. Yet, so long as he himself
lived, he was bound to labour in the sacred cause he had 
undertaken. With the past full in his view, he could not despair.
Any way it is for man to deserve, as it is for God to give,
success.</p>
            <p>Instead of sinking beneath his sense of the great loss suffered
by the destruction of Crête-a-Pierrot, Toussaint, after a brief
interval, resumed hostile operations with an active energy not
surpassed even in his days of triumph. He had indeed disappeared 
from the view of his foes, but it was only to deceive them
by false and rapid marches, to prepare ambuscades, to harass
them on their flanks and in the rear; to make them sink under the
fatigue, hunger, thirst, and want of sleep he compelled them to
undergo. Now he covered his flight by deserts and by flames,
to make their victory more baneful than ordinary defeat; now
he waited for his prey in a defile, always doing much, by the
force of his genius, to carry the warfare beyond all acknowledged
rules. Christophe in the north, Dessalines in the west, supported
his adroit and rapid movements. At the sound of the church
bells, he sent forth from the pulpit a manly and magical eloquence,
which painted to the eye and impressed on the heart the horrors
of servitude and the delights of liberty, and preached a religion
which, acknowledging all men as brothers, disclaimed and 
condemned slavery, and made his soldiers feel that in fighting for
freedom they fought on the side of God and Christ. His sermon
over, he resumed the soldier and the general, disappeared, flew,
re-appeared, and seemed almost as if he possessed a species of
omnipresence. All the time he had an army at his command,
though where they were, or what the number and resources of
his troops, was hidden to all but himself and a chosen few;
while, by means as sure as they were hidden, he learnt all
<sic corr="that took">thatt ook</sic> place among his assailants. Moved by his authority,
his spies and scouts, now in appearance blind, deaf, lame, and
now beggars or fugitives, made light of toil, peril, and torture
<pb id="beard203" n="203"/>
in a service which religion, as well as civil obedience, seemed
to them to exact.</p>
            <p>The different bodies of the French army, who believed 
Toussaint ruined, if not dead, felt his blows on every side; as they
returned to the Cape, or to Port-au-Prince, he disturbed them,
beat them, worried them, alike in their communications, in their
attacks, in their marches, in their retreat. Everywhere, he 
carried alarm and dread. When the soldiers entered the Cape,
Toussaint appeared in its suburbs. The city required both walls
and defenders. The blacks, if they appeared to be friends,
proved to be enemies in reality. With all despatch, Leclerc
raised anew the fortifications of a town in which, more than
ever, the party of servitude and the party of liberty disputed and
contended. In that war, no man knew his neighbour; you
lived side by side with your enemy; you slept under the same
roof, you ate at the same table with him, and yet you knew him
not; for there were blacks on the side of the consul, and there
were whites on the side of Toussaint. At length, arms were
taken up, the ships supplied cannon, and the sailor was brought
on shore to fight. Only the more vigour did Toussaint put
forth, and the city was about to become his prey when fresh
troops arrived from France, and the black hero thought it 
prudent to retire.</p>
            <p>The position of Leclerc had become one of extreme difficulty.
By painful experience, he had learnt with what singular enemies
he had to contend. Of what use was it to continue a war in
which victories cost so much and were so readily effaced by 
reverses? Already had he lost five thousand men in battle; a
like number, sick or wounded, were in the hospitals. Besides,
the war offered no reward; what glory was there even in totally
subjugating semi-barbarian blacks? Conquest, instead of 
enriching the soldier, only carried him into burning towns or desert
mountains. The army murmured; the climate was intolerable;
the work they had to perform was repulsive. “The consul,”
they said, “has sent us here to perish, companions though we
are of his achievements and sharers in his glory.”</p>
            <p>These, and similar complaints, which reached the ears of the
<pb id="beard204" n="204"/>
captain of the expedition, occasioned him lively disquietude, the
rather because his army was attacked by a malady which, bad
as it was, threatened to become more deadly; and although he
expected fresh troops, scarcely would all suffice to keep the 
population in order, to say nothing of the exigencies of war. He
had, it is true, many blacks under his banners, but could he
count on their fidelity? Did he not know, that their chiefs who
showed the most zeal and devotion, were wrapped in impenetrable 
dissimulation, and that he kept them obedient only by
reiterated promises of liberty.</p>
            <p>The people of colour appeared to him more devoted, but had
they not, in preceding wars, passed now into the party of the
whites, and now into that of the blacks, as much from 
inconstancy as for the sake of liberty? The barbarous chiefs, however,
who were his enemies, gave him most concern; Christophe,
filled with prowess and intrepidity; Dessalines, that savage
Achilles, of unequalled courage and fury; Toussaint, who by his
prolific genius was capable of everything, who escaped only to
reappear, who everywhere caused foes to spring up under the
feet of his army, as if they were born of the mountains.</p>
            <p>Reflecting on these things—counting his losses, surveying his
disappointments, measuring his enemies, calculating his difficulties, 
and forecasting his prospects—Leclerc came to the determination 
that he should act wisely, if he tried what could be done
in the way of negotiation. Should the attempt fail, he would
have gained time; should it succeed, he would have put an end
to a doubtful and disastrous war.</p>
            <p>Among the heads of the hostile army, Christophe had shown
the least aversion to accommodation. With him, Leclerc
commenced his negotiations; he intimated to Christophe that,
as the mother country would unquestionably give legal 
confirmation to the abolition of servitude, the war was useless and
without an object, and that the sole obstacle to peace being the
ambition of Toussaint, he would arrange with him in order to
arrest that chief in the most secret manner possible. Instead of
becoming the instrument of that perfidy, Christophe replied in
language and tones of virtue, saying that to arrest his friend,
<pb id="beard205" n="205"/>
his companion, his chief, would be to betray at once friendship
and honour, as well as his country; and that a treason so 
disgraceful could not for a moment be entertained by him. He
ended his letter with these words: “Show us the laws which
guarantee our liberty, then Toussaint, my brethren, myself—all
of us—will with joy throw ourselves into the arms of our mother
country. How could we believe the consul's words, brought to
us, as they were, amid demonstrations of war? Excuse,” he
added, “the fears and the alarm of a people which has suffered
so much in slavery: give it grounds of confidence, if you desire
to terminate the calamities of Saint Domingo; then, forgetting
the past, we shall in security enjoy the present and the future.”</p>
            <p>Struck with the wisdom and energy of this reply, Leclerc felt
that it was more than ever necessary to put away all idea of
slavery, which could be restored only in very different 
circumstances. With this view, he dealt freely in protestations. The
consul, he urged, could not have proposed laws for a country
with which he was not acquainted, but in the name of the 
Supreme Being, the avenger of falsehood, he affirmed that the
liberty of the blacks was the basis of the laws which would be
passed.</p>
            <p>An interview ensued, and, in reliance on the protestations
and the oath of Leclerc, Christophe went over to the French
with twelve hundred men, surrendering the mountains of Limbé,
Port-Français, and Grande Rivière, with an immense amount of
warlike stores.</p>
            <p>Christophe immediately sought an interview with Toussaint,
and among other things, remarked that Leclerc appeared very
sorry at having undertaken the war, that he had done so in the
persuasion that he could soon bring it to a successful termination, 
and that, being now disabused of that error, was desirous
of concluding a peace; adding that, at the express request of the
captain-general, he wished to converse with Toussaint on the 
subject.</p>
            <p>On his part, Toussaint complained that Christophe had
listened to overtures from the enemy, contrary to military
<pb id="beard206" n="206"/>
discipline, since he had no authority from his superior officer.
Before leaving, Christophe put into the hands of Toussaint a
letter from Leclerc. Prevented at the moment from reading
the communication, Toussaint did not learn till after 
Christophe's departure, that he had gone over to the French. The
regret which he felt gave place to astonishment, and astonishment 
was succeeded by indignation. He sent for Adjutant-General 
Fontaine, the chief of his staff, and to him alone communicated 
the contents of the letter, directing him to go to 
Christophe, and command him to repair to the head-quarters at 
Marmelade, in order to explain his conduct. The traitor affected
compliance. Many of his officers, on hearing of the mission of
General Fontaine, declared that they had been misled. On his
return, that officer reported the surrender of Port-Français and
other places. Toussaint L'Ouverture assembled his chief officers,
and announced to them the extraordinary event. Christophe's
conduct appeared to them no less incomprehensible than 
blameworthy. The news having spread among the people and the
soldiers, they burst forth in reproaches against him, and by a
spontaneous -movement, assembled around Toussaint's dwelling,
to assure him of their fidelity and devotedness.</p>
            <p>In this conjuncture, the hope of an approaching peace, which
for a moment even Toussaint had indulged, vanished wholly.
The warlike spirit became universal, together with indignation
at the treachery. All swore to die for their chief, because in so
doing they would die for liberty. Toussaint's orders flew on all
sides in order to prevent or abate the consequences of the 
perfidy. He still had, in the west and in the north, faithful 
battalions and devoted districts; the less his resources became, the
more grand did his character appear. Had fortune, then, 
abandoned him? Could he no longer look to the Highest of all
Powers, whose work he had undertaken, and by whose hand he
had been guided and protected? Was his country, after all, to
fall under the dishonourable yoke of servitude? Adversity
crushes only ordinary men; Toussaint took courage even from
despair.</p>
            <p>Shortly, he learned that Dessalines had imitated Christophe
<pb id="beard207" n="207"/>
and joined the ranks of the enemy. This was the second heavy
blow. Toussaint did not so much regard the individual loss of
these two leaders, nor the loss of the troops they carried with
them, nor the loss of the lands they commanded, as the loss of
his own influence which must ensue, and the perplexity in which
he found himself as to who was and who was not trustworthy.
His best captains—Christophe, Dessalines, Laplume, Clervaux,
his two brothers, his nephew, were in the camp of his foes.
Where could he be sure to find men worthy of his confidence?</p>
            <p>Under these circumstances it was that Leclerc put every
means into action in order to induce Toussaint to come to an
accommodation. The captain-general was the more desirous of
such a result because, though he knew that Toussaint's power
was broken, he knew also that the population at large were
wholly alienated from his own government, and might at any
moment be roused to a resistance more determined and more
sanguinary than what they had made already. With a view to
appease the hardly suppressed ill-humour, Leclerc had sent
Rigaud out of the island, hoping thereby to gain some favour
with the blacks. The effect on the whole was inconsiderable.
Even after their treachery, the negro chiefs were idols, while
Frenchmen were objects of indifference or detestation. This
contrasted feeling was observed, and is spoken of by an 
eyewitness thus:—</p>
            <p>“On arriving at the Cape, I had occasion to make very
serious reflections. I saw many of our general officers in full
uniform pass by; the inhabitants, no matter what their colour,
showed no sign of exterior deference. Suddenly I heard a
noise—it was General Dessalines; he came for the first time to
pay his respects to the Captain-General Leclerc. The population 
of both sexes and of all colours rushed to meet him: they
fell down at his approach. I was saddened rather than revolted.
Dark and painful ideas accompanied me to the mansion of the
general-in-chief. In the ante-chamber I found General Dessalines. 
The horror he inspired me with kept me at a distance
from him. He asked who I was, and came to me, and without
looking me in the face, said, in a rough voice,‘I am General
<pb id="beard208" n="208"/>
Dessalines; in bad times, General, I have heard you much
spoken of.’ His bearing and his manners were savage; I was
surprised at his words, which announced assurance rather than
remorse. The barbarian must have felt himself powerful, or he
would not have dared to take that attitude.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref14" n="14" rend="sc" target="note14">*</ref></p>
            <note id="note14" n="14" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref14">* Mémoires, &amp;c., par Lacroix, ii. 191, 2.</note>
            <p>Once before had Leclerc made an attempt to bring Toussaint
to treat. The attempt failed. A second effort had a different
result. To Leclerc's overture, Toussaint in substance replied,
“I am powerful enough to burn and ravage, as well as to sell
dearly a life which has not been useless to the mother country.”
But with bootless destruction such a mind as Toussaint's could
not be satisfied. For a great object he had taken up arms: if
that object could be secured by peaceful means, his duty was
clear. This view, on which his own mind had for some time
been dwelling, was enforced by the representations and advice of
persons around him, whose fidelity and courage gave them a
right to be heard. Toussaint became less indisposed to listen to
terms of accommodation. Leclerc proposed, as the principal 
conditions of peace, to leave in Toussaint's hands the government of
Saint Domingo, to hold by his side the office of delegate from
France, and to employ Toussaint's officers according to their
rank. “I swear,” he said, “before the face of the Supreme
Being, to respect the liberty of the people of Saint Domingo.”</p>
            <p>Toussaint L'Ouverture replied, “I accept everything which is
favourable for the people and for the army; and, for myself, I
wish to live in retirement.”</p>
            <p>Noble resolution! resolution worthy of all thy previous 
conduct, thou noble-hearted man! All for others, nothing for 
thyself! Yet had he now the option of retaining supreme power in
the island, sanctioned and guaranteed by French authority.
And out of that supreme power, were he ambitious, he might
have carved a crown. But didst thou think that thy frank
disinterestedness might be turned to thy own ruin? The 
possibility could hardly have escaped thy sagacious and foreseeing
mind. Nevertheless, rather wilt thou incur any personal risk
than prolong the horrors of this war, which every day becomes
more fratricidal and more disastrous!</p>
            <pb id="beard209" n="209"/>
            <p>As a consequence of this accommodation an interview between
Toussaint and Leclerc was agreed on. It was proposed that
they should meet on a spot in the mountains of Mornay.
Learning that the place had given rise to suspicions, Toussaint
magnanimously resolved to repair to the Cape. His journey
was a triumph. Everywhere crowds pressed and prostrated
themselves before the hero. They hailed him as their friend;
they hailed him as their liberator; for in their acclaim they bore
in mind that the liberty for which he had fought, was sanctioned
and secured by the captain-general's solemn oath. His arrival
at the Cape was announced by salvos from both the sea and the
land forces. The multitude surrounded him with demonstrations 
of love and veneration; the mother pointed him out to
her child, and girls strewed his path with flowers. Leclerc
received him in his mansion, situated near the sea. During the
interview four hundred horsemen, who had accompanied 
Toussaint, stood near, drawn up in order and with bare sabres. To
the captain-general Toussaint was no longer a fanatical slave in
revolt, and condemned to death, nor was he an unnatural father.
The consul's brother-in-law took pains to laud his good faith and
his magnanimity. He dwelt with emphasis on the reconciliation
thus ratified, which would restore prosperity to the colony. He
repeated his oath in presence of the chiefs of the two armies:
“General,” he said, “one cannot but praise you and admire you
when one has, as you have done, borne the burden of the government 
of Saint Domingo. Your presence in this city is a proof
of your magnanimity and your good faith. Our reconciliation
will make this island, of which you are the restorer, bloom
again; and will consolidate its new institutions, which are the
fundamental basis of the liberty and the happiness of all.”</p>
            <p>“When the people of Saint Domingo,” replied L'Ouverture,
“triumphed in a war foreign both in relation to France and to
themselves, they never thought that they should ever have to
resist their natural protector. If explanations had preceded
your arrival in this island, the cannon would not have been fired,
except to welcome the envoy of a great power, and you would,
on reaching these shores, have seen no other lights than 
<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fre">feux de</foreign></hi> 
<pb id="beard210" n="210"/>
<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fre">joie.</foreign></hi> 
You knew for certainty that I was at Santo Domingo.
There was still time to send me news of your mission. When
you were before the Cape, General Christophe begged you to
grant him delay sufficient to acquaint me with the fact that a
French squadron was on our shores; you might reasonably have
acceded to his request, instead of reducing the people to despair
by your threats, and exposing your army on the crater of a
volcano.”</p>
            <p>Leclerc admitted that pilots, whom he had taken near the
bay of Samana, had assured him that Toussaint L'Ouverture was
at Santo Domingo. “But I am the brother-in-law of the first
consul; I am commander-in-chief of a French army, and 
consequently in position and rank superior to General Christophe, and
I did not think it consistent with my dignity to stop before a
brigadier-general, and to listen to all his allegations.”</p>
            <p>“Nevertheless,” rejoined Toussaint, “you waited for four days,
and you will agree that some days more would not have done an
injury to your honour, since, according to the words and the
letter of your brother-in-law, you are intrusted with only a
pacific mission. It seems to me that by patience you would
have served equally France and Saint Domingo.”</p>
            <p>“It is true; but I was not master of myself. Let us retain
no recollection of the past; all shall be repaired. Let us,
General, rejoice at our union. Your sons, the officers who have
accompanied you, as well as the generals and officers of my army,
who are here, must be witnesses of our common gladness.” At
these words the door of the hall opened, and at Leclerc's invitation 
all the persons who were in the next apartment entered
and took their places. In their presence the captain-general
renewed his oaths. During this exchange of words Leclerc,
pressing Toussaint as to the reduced condition of his resources,
asked him where he could have obtained arms to continue the
war. In a truly Lacedemonian manner the hero replied, “I
would have taken yours.”</p>
            <p>Presently there entered a fine boy, who leapt on the neck of
Toussaint L'Ouverture—it was his youngest son. During the
war he had been lost by his father, and carried off by the French.
<pb id="beard211" n="211"/>
Taken to the Cape, he was consigned to the care of his tutor;
and now, as a touching pledge of friendship, he had been restored
to his father, who was deeply affected by thus recovering his
beloved child.</p>
            <p>In returning from this conference, in the details of which we
learn on how insignificant causes depend peace and war with
all their mighty issues, Toussaint L'Ouverture passed through
the posts of the French army, in the midst of the acclamations
of the soldiers, the militia, and the people, who crowded around
him; and under salvos of artillery entered Marmelade, where
the commander received him at the head of his own troops.
The day following he addressed the grenadiers and the dragoons
of his guard. Having spoken to them of the peace, and shown
them that it could not be violated except by perjury, he praised
their courage, and thanked them for the love and devotedness
they had displayed toward himself, and solemnly declared that
the recollection of their deeds would for ever remain engraven
on his mind. In order to testify to them his satisfaction, and at
the same time take his farewell, he embraced all their officers.
Those brave and hardy veterans could not restrain their tears,
and the soldiers were sad and inconsolable. Toussaint then
took the road for Ennery, which he had chosen for his residence.
When near it, he was surrounded by crowds of people, who
shouted out, “General, have you abandoned us?”</p>
            <p>“No, my children,” he answered, “all your brethren are under
arms, and the officers of all ranks retain their posts.”</p>
            <p>When Toussaint L'Ouverture had fixed himself in the fertile
and delightful valley of Ennery, to enjoy the repose of private
and domestic life, he found occupation a necessity, and employed
his energy in repairing and improving the dwellings of the 
inhabitants, and dispensing around him other benefits. Though
retired from the world he was not forgotten. Generals and
other officers of the French army, and strangers from distant
lands, came to visit him, and were welcomed with an affability
which was a part of his nature. Exempt from fear and 
disquietude, he lived in the bosom of his family as if he had been
<pb id="beard212" n="212"/>
guarded by an army. He rode over the country, and was 
everywhere greeted with tokens of respect.</p>
            <p>With the cessation of hostilities, bands of black troops 
descended from the mountains, and the two armies mingled together
as brothers. Freedom rendered friends those whom slavery had
made deadly enemies. The population laid down their arms to
engage in the labours of the field. The dwellings, which the
fear of servitude had burned down, rose again under the reign
of liberty. With a view to confirm the peace, the captain of
the expedition put into the hands of Christophe the police of
the north, and into those of Dessalines the police of the west.
The cities which had been consumed were rebuilt. Vessels
soon filled the ports. Commerce began once more to flourish.
Everything promised a smiling future. Songs were heard and
dances were seen in the villages. The whole country offered a
proof how happy this world would be but for the disturbances
occasioned by human passions.</p>

            <argument>
              <p>Leclerc's uneasy position in Saint Domingo from insufficiency of food, from the
existence in his army of large bodies of blacks, and especially from a most
destructive fever.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ERE long, the natural consequences of the ravages which had
been carried over the country, and of the abstraction from 
agriculture of a large portion of the population, were felt in scarcity
of provisions, the rather that Saint Domingo did not abound in
articles of human food of a superior kind. This scarcity was
augmented by the necessity of supporting out of the public
magazines a large number of soldiers, for though the European
part of the army was much reduced, a large number of blacks
and men of colour had been thrown on the government stores.
Shortness of food and the high prices which ensue, are specially
trying to a government of force. Complaints began to spread
among the native population, and not without difficulty were
the servants of the state supplied with the necessaries of life.</p>
            <p>Application for aid was made to the governors of foreign 
possessions in the neighbourhood. The Spaniards furnished supplies
with chivalrous generosity; but those supplies were very far
from being sufficient. The English, who had not anticipated
the success of the French arms, and saw that success with 
uneasiness, refused to give succour. From Americans a similar
answer was received. The conduct of their agents disclosed the
<pb id="beard214" n="214"/>
regret which their governments felt in not finding at Saint
Domingo, under the French sway, the commercial advantages
which they enjoyed while it was ruled by Toussaint L'Ouverture.
The state of the island, combined with the native politeness of
the French character, caused attentions to be paid to foreign ships
and visitors, which were interpreted into tokens of a sense of civil
and political weakness. This adverse impression found its way
into the minds of the blacks, so that the spirit of the colonial
army became increasingly difficult to manage. Thus what at
first was the captain-general's power, proved a source of weakness 
and embarrassment. To provide a remedy, he attempted
to incorporate the colonial troops with the reinforcements that
came from France, but the prejudices of Europeans rendered the
plan all but nugatory. Yet, if it was dangerous to have entire
large bodies of blacks, it was not less dangerous to discharge and
dismiss them at once. Leclerc had no resource but time, and
sought to govern by dividing. Accordingly, he took care to
employ black soldiers only in small detachments, and regarded
even desertion with satisfaction. He could not, however, feel
at ease unless he knew that the blacks were resuming their 
agricultural labours, and though in sending them back to the plantations, 
he received assistance from some of their chiefs, he was
made sensible of the want of such an influence as that which
Toussaint L'Ouverture had exerted before the war, and effected
his purpose only on a limited scale.</p>
            <p>These difficulties, however, though in themselves not small,
were inconsiderable compared with those which sprang from a
terrible malady with which the island, and especially its 
European inhabitants, was now visited. The yellow fever, which
had already proved destructive, broke out with great violence at
the same time at Port-au-Prince and at the Cape. It appeared
there in a form unusually repulsive and deadly. It seized persons
who were in good health, without any premonition. Sometimes
death was the immediate consequence. Happy those who were
immediately carried off! Ordinarily it was slow in its progress as
well as frightful in its inflictions. The disorder began in the brain,
by an oppressive pain accompanied or followed by fever. The
<pb id="beard215" n="215"/>
patient was devoured with burning thirst. The stomach, 
distracted by pains, in vain sought relief by efforts to disburden itself.
Fiery veins streaked the eye; the face was inflamed, and dyed of
a dark dull red colour; the ears from time to time rang painfully.
Now mucous secretions surcharged the tongue, and took away
the power of speech; now the sick man spoke, but in speaking
had a foresight of death. When the violence of the disorder
approached the heart, the gums were blackened. The sleep,
broken, or troubled by convulsions or by frightful visions, was
worse than the waking hours, and when the reason sank under
a delirium which had its seat in the brain, repose utterly forsook
the patient's couch. The progress of the fire within was marked
by yellowish spots, which spread over the surface of the body.
If, then, a happy crisis came not, all hope was gone. Soon the
breath infected the air with a fetid odour, the lips glazed, despair
painted itself in the eyes, and sobs, with long intervals of silence,
formed the only language. From each side of the mouth spread
foam, tinged with black and burnt blood. Blue streaks mingled
with the yellow over all the frame. Death came on the 
thirteenth day, though more commonly it tarried till the 
seventeenth. All remedies were useless. Rarely did the victims
escape.</p>
            <p>The malady produced a general melancholy. Its depressing
effects were visible in the troops who had not yet been stricken
with the fever. You saw the men regard each other with furtive
glances, and in deep yet ominous silence: their arms looked
tarnished; their steps were heavy and slow. Unconquerable in
the field, they already felt themselves the victims of destiny.
When undergoing review, the men, scarcely expecting to see
each other again, affected a foolish gaiety, the real character of
which was betrayed by a bitter smile, or took leave of each
other sadly, as pilgrims, through suffering, to the dark shores of
the eternal world.</p>
            <p>The city of the Cape then presented one of those sights which
are rare in the history of human calamities. Scarcely had a
part of the buildings destroyed by the conflagration been hastily
reconstructed, when the town and the hospitals were filled with
<pb id="beard216" n="216"/>
the sick and the dying. The chief hospital, situated on a height
which overhangs the city, having been burnt down, consisted
now only of large sheds covered with sugar canes. Therein the
patients were for the most part laid in straw, unprovided with
necessary appliances, exposed now to the fury of storms, now to
torrents of rain, and now to the burning rays of the sun. Those
remaining in the city were better protected and cared for, but
breathing an impurer air, and deprived of breezes by the 
mountains, they suffered scarcely less, and died as certainly.</p>
            <p>Military discipline disappeared: the common soldier had the
same authority as the general, and each general acknowledged
no authority except his own. Men spoke no more of combats,
of exploits, of glory. The heart of the soldier sank within him.
Even the funeral knell ceased its mournful sounds; the common
calamity crushed the sense of religious observance. In the midst
of disorder and confusion death heaped victims on victims.
Friend followed friend in quick succession; the sick were avoided
from the fear of contagion, and for the same reason the dead
were left without burial. Despair alone remained in activity—
fierce despair, for the dying man could cast his eye on neither
friend nor nurse, and had to suffer and expire in terrific solitude
or more terrific companionship. The country, the mountains,
the sea, afforded no place of refuge. The troops that were
removed to a distance from the towns were not the less attacked.
Their camp was transformed into an hospital. Soldiers died
under trees laden with fruit and under plants breathing perfumes.
The ships of war and merchant vessels lost their crews. Eight
and forty passengers from Bordeaux expired in disembarking at
the Cape. Terrified at the destruction, some, on nearing the
island, went on board vessels that were quitting its infected
shores, yet perished, smitten by the poisoned air. Four 
thousand men who came in Dutch vessels perished, Fear multiplied
the victims.</p>
            <p>When the malady was in all its force, human passions 
manifested their guilty excesses. Virtue was disregarded when it no
longer offered an earthly reward. Some sought distraction and
relief to their wretchedness in gambling and in voluptuousness;
<pb id="beard217" n="217"/>
violence and adultery became common. Others endeavoured to
drown their torments in reckless intoxication; others, again,
attired in military costume, which at such a moment was simply
ridiculous, threw insult at the disease, and braved death, either
in satirical gaiety or in buffooneries, or in roars of silly laughter.
The words “Ah! the funny fellow,” became a derisive phrase to
indicate a poor wretch that was trying to laugh or trick away
his calamity. Others, again, deep sunk in guilt, sought to
deceive death in the arms of a mistress or in perfumed baths.
While all around was perishing, songs were heard from the sea.
They were the attempts of men who thus tried to cheat 
themselves into momentary joy. The nearer men were to eternity, the
more greedy they were of the pleasures of earth.</p>
            <p>Pauline, the wife of Leclerc and the sister of the consul, did
not renounce her voluptuous habits in the midst of so terrible a
plague. In the hope of breathing a less infected air, she had
gone to a country house, on the declivity of a pleasant hill
which overhung the sea. Here she passed her hours in pleasure
and luxury. She saw die around her officers whose incense she
had welcomed, but for whose sufferings she showed no concern—
intent only on putting away all unpleasant objects, and seizing
with avidity on sources of gratification. Now she caused 
herself, like a queen, to be borne in a palanquin through the most
beautiful scenes of nature; there would she, for hours together,
dwell in contemplating the ocean and its delightful shores,
loaded with the luxuries of tropical vegetation: now she plunged
into the depths of odoriferous forests, and surrendered herself
to the captivating reveries of love; and now she sailed on the
sea, accompanied by courtiers, musicians, and buffoons, as if she
would sustain the character of Venus rising from the waves.</p>
            <p>What is still more remarkable is that she took pains to defy
the malady by festivities, in which she gathered around her
dancing, music, pleasure, and voluptuousness: there she drew
on herself admiration by her wit, her graces, her beauty, and
the ravishing tenderness of her looks. But around and in
those festivities, Death bore his funeral torches. The balls
which she ceased not to give took place on the brink of
<pb id="beard218" n="218"/>
the grave. The dancers of to-night were dead on the morrow.
But the more joyous did she affect to appear. “These,” she
said, “are our last moments; let us pass them in pleasure.”</p>
            <p>As the disorder raged in other places as well as in the cities
of the Cape and Port-au-Prince, there died every day, on land
and on sea, not less than from three to four hundred persons. More
and more irregular in its symptoms and its course, the fever
baffled and defied the skill of the physicians, who died together
with their patients.</p>
            <p>The little attention which at first was paid to funeral rites,
became less and less, and soon was wholly discontinued. The
dead bodies were put on the outside of the doors and carried off
by night. If anything could excite compassion, it was to see
on some of those livid frames the scars of wounds received in
the battles of Europe, where he had gained his fame who sent
those warriors and heroes to die on a distant foreign and deadly
shore. As it was necessary to remove the dead as soon as they
had breathed their last, some were carried off while yet alive;
groans were heard in the heaps of abandoned corpses, and from
the putrid mass some rose and returned to take their place
among the living. As very many bodies were tossed into the
sea, the waves bore them up and down the harbour, or left them
on the shore, painful mementoes to spectators, and food for
birds and beasts of prey, while they added to the foul infection
with which the atmosphere was burdened.</p>
            <p>During the prevalence of these accumulated disasters, the
black population, proof against the pest, remained faithful to
the peace which had been forced on them and their venerated
chief. Had they chosen to rise, the whole expedition would
have perished. Their virtue was more than abstinence from
self-avengement. With characteristic hospitality they received
sick persons into their homes, and gave them unlooked-for aid:
they did more; they gave them tears and sympathy, seeing in
them not Frenchmen and assailants, but sufferers. There were
other benefactors. Sisters of charity, truly worthy of the name,
went from street to street, and from bed to bed, ministering
with tenderness and skill to the sick, the despairing, and the 
<pb id="beard219" n="219"/>
departing. Womanly love was almost the only virtue that 
maintained itself erect. When all other remedies had proved vain,
that noble affection showed itself fertile in resources, nor was it
the less respectable because in the extremity it resorted to fetish
practices which had their origin in Africa. More simple and
even more touching was that manifestation of it which 
compelled young women to follow their lovers to their graves,
<q direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>Amid the faithless only faithful found.</l></lg></q>
It is terrible to think that some of these worthy women may
afterwards have been repaid with slavery.</p>
            <p>At length, when the summer heats had reached their height,
the malady redoubled its fury, and broke down alike benevolence 
and virtue. Then was the harvest of death. According
to authentic tables, there died fifteen hundred officers, twenty
thousand soldiers, nine thousand sailors, and three thousand
persons who loosely hung about the skirts of the army in quest
of employment or fortune. Not fewer than fourteen generals
lost their lives in the plague. Of that number was Debelle,
whose virtues made him regretted alike by foes and friends;
Dugua, an intrepid and joyous old man, whose hairs had grown
grey on the borders of the Nile; Hardy, who had displayed rare
courage in the victories and the reverses of the expedition.
Almost incredible is it that there died seven hundred medical
men, worthy, for the most, of high praise, such was their courage,
their patience, their devotedness.</p>
            <p>The malady changed the character of the army. Those who
survived, experiencing a long and difficult convalescence, became
habitually depressed, morose, or exasperated. Some had their
memory weakened; some remained broken down or crippled
for life. Discipline was restored with difficulty. Even news
from home brought little pleasure, and gave only a transient
relief; and communications with France were intercepted, in
order, so far as possible, to conceal from the mother country the
awful loss which she had endured.</p>
            <p>Such was the terrible punishment which fell on the predatory
<pb id="beard220" n="220"/>
expedition sent by the Corsican adventurer against the hero and
patriot of St. Domingo.</p>
            <p>And can there be a more decisive proof of anything than we
have here of the honour of Toussaint L'Ouverture? The 
necessity of the French was his opportunity. With what ease now
might he have mustered those blacks which were in Leclerc's
way, and extorted from his enfeebled hands the sovereignty of
the island. That Toussaint remained quiet at Ennery disproves
the base insinuations which were fabricated expressly for his
ruin.</p>
          </div3>
          <div3 type="chapter">
            <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
            <argument>
              <p>Bonaparte and Leclerc conspire to effect the arrest of Toussaint L'Ouverture,
who is treacherously seized, sent to France, and confined in the castle of
Joux; partial risings in consequence.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IF the establishment in Saint Domingo of the authority of
France had been the object of the expedition, the present settlement 
of its affairs would have been left to unfold its resources,
and the blessings of the existing peace would have been permanent. 
All opposition had been put down. Mutual explanations
had been given. With one exception the leaders of the blacks
held rank and power in the French army. Toussaint L'Ouverture, 
the only exception, was engaged in rural pursuits and acts
of beneficence. Leclerc was sole master in the island. Hayti
was now at least a colonial dependency of France. And if there
were evils or obstacles which he could not at the moment put
away, they were nothing more than such as promised to disappear 
before good government, aided by the healing and reformatory 
hand of time. Even through the tempest of the plague,
tokens of coming serenity were readily discerned. But the
occupation of the island was only the first act in the drama.</p>
            <p>The intelligence of the ravages of the fever in St. Domingo
shocked the mind of Bonaparte, though he had foreseen and
<pb id="beard221" n="221"/>
even premeditated the calamity. One obstacle which lay in his
way to the imperial throne had been removed. So far the 
expedition had not proved nugatory. There were two other 
obstacles. One was the freedom of the blacks. Such freedom, in
the consul's eyes, was licentiousness. It was, moreover, 
incompatible with his designs. If Saint Domingo remained free, the
other French colonies must and would be free. In their 
emancipation, the colonial system would be endangered, nay, would
soon be lost; for freedom was the precursor of independence:
and if the colonies became independent, what strongholds would
France possess in the West Indies to check the growing power
of England; and where would be its outposts to keep the United
States in good behaviour? Even more important were those
dependencies when considered as pastures for the powerful and
the aspiring around the consul's person. Let the colonies be
reduced into servitude; then would they naturally enter as
constituent parts in an empire under governors with more than
the power of ordinary princes, who, with Bonaparte at their
head, would form a regular and august political hierarchy, and
so lay the basis of a dominion which might extend widely over
both hemispheres, if not in time comprehend the civilized
world. To the ambitious Corsican the prospect was enchanting.
The herds of Haytian negroes must be sent back into slavery.</p>
            <p>This resolution, he knew, could not be carried into effect so
long as Toussaint L'Ouverture lived on the island. His existence
there was the second great impediment. That impediment, too,
the consul determined to remove. The determination was the
more readily formed because the world had come to regard
Toussaint as a sort of rival to Bonaparte. The phrase became
current which designated the one “the first of the blacks,” and
the other “the first of the whites.” Comparisons were made
between the two which the First Consul always found offensive,
and which were not always to the First Consul's advantage.
Was his bright star to pale before the fiery meteor of a slave?
Besides, that slave had not been easily subdued; he had all but
overcome and destroyed the soldiers of Egypt and Italy. When
peace was concluded, it was difficult to say whether the
<pb id="beard222" n="222"/>
assailant or the assailed was in the worse condition. This
manly and effective resistance Bonaparte could not forgive. It
would have been less intolerable had it been made by 
Europeans; but to come from negro slaves—it was an unpardonable
offence. Yes, Bonaparte hated Toussaint, and resolved to effect
his destruction. His arrest was the first point to be gained.
With Toussaint in his hands, everything else he judged would
be easy.</p>
            <p>The First Consul was not deterred by the consideration that
such a step could not be taken without dissimulation and 
perfidy. The end covered, if it did not justify, the means, in his
eyes. In Leclerc he had a ready and passive instrument. Nor
was the captain-general without his own reasons for the 
contemplated apprehension. The hatred borne by the master had
taken possession of the servant's soul. Little satisfaction did he
feel in a peace which a hard fate had induced him to seek and
conclude. The popularity of the negro chief caused him to be
an object of fear with Leclerc. In the war, the chief glory had
been gained by his foe, and now that foe, having become his
rival, eclipsed Leclerc in the estimation of the natives of nearly
all classes and all opinions. He had, moreover—and he knew he
had—injured, deeply injured Toussaint L'Ouverture, and injury
invariably begets a hatred in proportion to its own intensity.
Besides, the original plan, which so far had been successful,
remained to be completed. Leclerc, in consequence, was well
disposed to execute the consul's will.</p>
            <p>Without waiting for express directions in a matter on which
he well knew the mind of Bonaparte, the captain-general began
to prepare the way for the final act. For this purpose he spoke
of Toussaint, not as an independent power who had of his own
accord laid down arms, and declined the highest post in the
colony, but as a revolter who had been outlawed and condemned
to death, but pardoned by an act of grace on his own part.
Consulting him as to the disposition of the troops, so as to 
prevent suspicion, he sought occasions which, in extorting complaints
from him, might form the grounds of a disagreement, and so
afford pretexts for his seizure. Two frigates anchored off
<pb id="beard223" n="223"/>
Gonaïves. The soldiers no longer paid Toussaint military
honours. The plot was dimly seen by friends, who advised the
black hero to be on his guard. Some went so far as to 
recommend him to take measures for his personal security. He
replied, “For one to expose one's life for one's country when in
peril is a sacred duty; but to arouse one's country in order to
save one's life, is inglorious.”</p>
            <p>In order to give some colour to the contemplated arrest,
Leclerc complained that Toussaint's body-guard had not been
wholly disarmed. Toussaint replied that he had given orders
for its disbandment, and advised the captain-general to proceed
mildly in bringing that result about. Impatient of contradiction,
Leclerc employed force, and with difficulty succeeded. In this
opposition an excuse was found for filling the district of Ennery
with European troops. The inhabitants complained. Toussaint
L'Ouverture became the medium for making those complaints
known. “This was exactly what was wanted,” says one who
knew Leclerc's designs.</p>
            <p>On the 7th of June, General Brunet wrote to Toussaint
L'Ouverture the following letter:—</p>

                    <p>“The moment, citizen-general, has come to make known to
General Leclerc, in an incontestable manner, those who may
deceive him in regard to yourself: they are calumniators, since
your sentiments tend only to bring back order in the district
which you inhabit. It is necessary to render me aid in order to
restore the communication with the Cape, which was yesterday
interrupted, since three persons have been murdered by a band
of fifty brigands, between Ennery and Coupe-à-Pintade. Send
toward those places faithful men, whom you will pay well; I
will be accountable for the outlay. There are, my dear general,
<pb id="beard224" n="224"/>
arrangements which we ought to make in concert, which it is
impossible to treat of by letter, but which an hour's conference
would terminate. Had I not to-day been overwhelmed with
business, I would myself have brought the answer to your
letter. Occupied as I am, I must beg you to come to my 
residence. You will not find there all the pleasures which I would
wish to welcome you with, but you will find the frankness of an
honourable man, who desires nothing but the happiness of the
colony and your own happiness. If Madame Toussaint, whom
I shall have the greatest pleasure to become acquainted with,
could accompany you, I should be gratified; if she has occasion
for horses, I will send her mine. Never, general, will you find a
more sincere friend than myself. With confidence in the 
captain-general, and friendship toward all under him, you will enjoy
tranquillity.</p>

              </text>
            </q>
            <p>Now here is a piece of consummate villany. This man, who
signs himself Brunet, who calls himself a man of honour, and
who would have run any one through who should have thrown
on that honour the slightest doubt—this man, who probably
went to church, and heard mass and professed Christianity, or
who, at any rate, did not in private pick pockets or cut throats,
this man deliberately sits down and employs his ingenuity in
fabricating a tissue of lies in order to ensnare to his ruin an
innocent patriot, the liberator of his country. Every word in
this diabolical composition is selected with a view to deceive.
By implication, inuendo, and direct averment, the tissue of
falsehoods goes forward to its end. “You are, you know, alleged
to be less quick than might be wished. False, doubtless. Now
you may prove how false by acting in concert with me. Come
hither, and so convict your calumniators; let the captain-general
see how earnest you are for the furtherance of public tranquillity.”
This is a dexterous movement. To remind Toussaint that he
was suspected was to prepare him for the offered means of 
exculpation. An innocent man, from a consciousness of his 
<pb id="beard225" n="225"/>
innocence, and a guilty man, in order to affect and display such
consciousness, would alike be inclined to accept the 
expedient. Then for this honourable man, who does not invent, but
merely employs groundless suspicions, he himself is quite 
confident that his victim is calumniated. “No, in coming to me,
you come to a friend who knows the real facts, and so is fully
aware of what you have done and are doing to tranquillize the
country. But, notwithstanding your efforts, disturbances exist.
These must be put a stop to. I have said I have confidence in
you: I now show it, for I ask you to take the requisite
measures.” Excellent Jesuit! Yes, the way to beget confidence
is, you well know, to show confidence. But how show 
confidence so much as by employing a man to put down the very
evils he is accused of causing? Surely this, if anything would
make him feel that he is trusted, or at any rate show him how
desirable, even for his own bad purposes, if he has bad purposes,
it is that he should act as if he felt that he is trusted.</p>
            <p>“Then as to the cost of these efforts, we will settle that when
we meet.” Yes, it is a small affair of business between two
generals of division—nothing more—some brigands to 
exterminate, some expense to be incurred,—all to be amicably talked
of when the two friends are taking a glass of wine together, and
to be ended by an order for payment on the public purse.
What more simple, what more natural, what more straightforward? 
None but one deeply versed in deceit could have thought
of treachery.</p>
            <p>But the tricks are not exhausted. “We must have an interview. 
For that purpose I intended to come and see you. I
had ordered my horse and an escort; but really I cannot leave;
I am nailed to the spot. I must throw myself on your goodness; 
pray come; I will do all I can to make you comfortable,
and bring your wife with you on this little excursion—a mere
party of pleasure. Shall I send my own horses to convey her
and her domestics? What! do you hesitate? still hesitate?
Ah! take care you fail not to confide in the Captain-general.
Distrust on your part may justify distrust on his part. Insinuations 
are best repelled by confidingness. And, you know, trust
<pb id="beard226" n="226"/>
in Leclerc involves friendship towards me. Yes, you must
come; you will come.”</p>
            <p>In this wily epistle there is only one mistake, but it is a
serious one. Brunet declares that he is an honourable man.
Over this declaration, you, Toussaint, surely paused. Here
the cunning hand displays its cunning. Yet thy guileless
nature will not entertain a distrust. In general, the epistle
has a fair seeming. You will accept the invitation. Suspicion
of treachery is dishonourable to him who entertains it. And
had not Toussaint, when the clouds were really dark, gone to
the Cape? And did not a friendly arrangement ensue? The
oath of Leclerc remained in force. And here was an opportunity
not only to benefit his neighbours, but to purge himself from
any suspicions which weak men, or designing men, had raised.
As to the rumours of peril to himself, the timid always abound
in illusions of their own fabrication. A brave man never fears
danger, and a wise man is not very careful to shun danger.
Besides, the civilities of hospitality have their claims. Clearly,
on the whole, there was no valid reason against going, and
many valid reasons for going. Toussaint had intended to go
to Gonaïves before he received Brunet's letter. He was on his
way thither: he turned not back when the invitation was put
into his hands.</p>
            <p>Proceeding on his journey, he met Brunet on the plantation
called Georges, where the general was waiting for him. For
some time they conversed together. Then Brunet begged to
be excused, and left the room. The next moment there
entered from eighteen to twenty officers, with drawn swords
and pistols in their hands. Toussaint L'Ouverture took them
for assassins, and arose. He drew his sabre, resolved to sell
his life dearly. Then the colonel, who was at the head of the
band, seeing that he waited for them with intrepidity, advanced
toward him with his sword lowered, and said, “General, we
have not come here to attempt your life. We have merely
the order to secure your person.” At these words, Toussaint
put his sword back into the scabbard, saying, “The justice of
Heaven will avenge my cause.”</p>
            <pb id="beard227" n="227"/>
            <p>Those prophetic words have had accomplishment; those 
prophetic words will have accomplishment: nor ever will they be
fulfilled until slavery is blotted out of America, and is known no
more in the world.</p>
            <p>From the plantation, where he was arrested, to Gonaïves,
troops had been placed from distance to distance along the road.
At midnight, the prisoner was taken on board a French frigate,
called the ‘Creole.’ The officer who commanded the ship was
touched, even to tears, at the lot of that victim of the basest
treachery. They sailed for the Cape, where Toussaint was 
transferred to the Hero, which waited for them off the port. “Adieu,
Captain,” said the captive, on leaving the Creole, “I shall remember 
you, till my last sigh.” When he reached the Hero, he
found in his arms, St. Jean L'Ouverture, the very son, who, on
a brighter day, had been restored to him by Leclerc. Placide
L'Ouverture was arrested next day. Isaac was at Ennery.
Ignorant that his father had been seized, he was tranquilly
reading about seven o'clock in the morning, when he was startled
by a brisk firing, followed by alarming cries. Hastening from
the room, he beheld labourers, women, and children, running
hither and thither in terror, and from three to four hundred
French soldiers firing on them in pursuit. A servant urged
him to fly. He feared that evil had befallen his father, but
remained. Forthwith he was arrested. The officer told him
that his father had been embarked, and that he had orders from
General Brunet to apprehend him and all the family; adding
that he should not have fired on the people, had they not
attempted to bar his passage. The money and the papers belonging
to Toussaint L'Ouverture were taken possession of. The house
was rifled; insolence was added to robbery. Madame Toussaint
and her niece were carried off. “Only a heart of stone,” says
Isaac L'Ouverture,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref15" n="15" rend="sc" target="note15">*</ref><note id="note15" n="15" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref15">*<foreign lang="fre">“Mémoires d'Isaac, fils de Toussaint L'Ouverture,”</foreign> &amp;c., p. 309.</note> who has described the whole scene, “could
fail to be softened by the tears and the lamentations of the men,
the women, and the children who were present, and who 
deplored her (Madame Toussaint's) lot, when she was for ever
<pb id="beard228" n="228"/>
quitting her country, a part of her family, and her abode, which
was the abode of beneficence and hospitality. Those men, those
women, and those children, in the excess of their grief, expressed
their fears and their regrets with deep sensibility. “Madame,”
cried they, “are you leaving us? shall we never see each other
again?” then addressing the commanding officer, they added,
“Ah! at least, Sir, don't kill her, don't kill her children;”—they
all believed that Toussaint L'Ouverture himself was dead.
That woman, who was worthy of those marks of attachment and
love, quitted her home without taking anything with her.</p>
            <p>Madame Toussaint and her son Isaac, and her niece, were 
conducted to the Cape, and put on board the Hero; the vessel 
forthwith set sail for France. It is related that, in fixing, for the last
time, his straining eyes on the mountains made memorable by
his exploits, Toussaint L'Ouverture exclaimed, “They have only
felled the trunk of the tree (of the freedom of the blacks);
branches will sprout, for the roots are numerous and deep.”</p>
            <p>And in that confidence, thou large-hearted man, dost thou,
sail over that waste of waters; saddened, but not overwhelmed.
Thou carriest the cause of thy colour in thy soul, and, with a
mind replete with Christian principles and affections, thou
neither doubtest nor despondest. Twenty-five days hast thou
to live on the sea, uncertain of thy own fate; but with such
knowledge of thy oppressors as must have occasioned dark 
forecastings. To thy own view, however, thy past is bright. Not
for thyself, but for others hast thou toiled and bled: and those
others are the outcast, the ignorant, the injured, and the lost.
True disciple of thy Galilean Master, bear up in the recollection
of His load and His persecutions—yet heavier than thine. And
now, in the hour of darkness, find and acknowledge thy glory, in
that which heathen France accounts thy shame. Not on man's
judgment dost thou rely. Not by a local tribunal wilt thou be
judged. The wide earth will take cognizance of what thou didst
attempt and achieve, and pronounce thee a benefactor, not of
thy colour only, but of thy kind. Regret not the president's
chair, left vacant in thy beloved mother country, nor let men's
ingratitude and perfidy sour thy feelings. From high motives
<pb id="beard229" n="229"/>
thou wroughtest for a high purpose; and that purpose, though
not in thine own way, will be attained. Be greater by patience,
in the day of thy weakness, than thou wast in the day of thy
power by thy valour; and thy name will pass down to posterity,
encircled with undying fame. Listen to that solemn voice in thy
own heart, which tells thee that Hayti will be free.</p>
            <p>On the voyage, Toussaint was denied all intercourse with his
family; he was confined constantly to his cabin, and the door
was guarded by soldiers with fixed bayonets. Uncertain as to
his fate, yet apprehensive of a very dark future, he determined
to make a solemn appeal to Bonaparte, and prepared the following
epistle:—</p>

FIRST CONSUL OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC.
<salute>“CITIZEN FIRST CONSUL—</salute></opener>
                    <p>“I will not conceal my faults from you. I have 
committed some. What man is exempt? I am quite ready to
avow them. After the word of honour of the Captain-general
who represents the French Government, after a proclamation
addressed to the colony, in which he promised to throw the veil
of oblivion over the events which have taken place in Saint
Domingo, I, as you did on the l8th Brumaire, withdrew into the
bosom of my family. Scarcely had a month passed away, when
evil-disposed persons, by means of intrigues, effected my ruin with
the General-in-chief, by filling his mind with distrust against me.
I received a letter from him which ordered me to act in 
conjunction with General Brunet. I obeyed. Accompanied by two
persons I went to Gonaïves, where I was arrested. They sent
me on board the frigate Creole, I know not for what reason,
without any other clothes than those I had on. The next day
my house was exposed to pillage; my wife and my children were
arrested; they had nothing, not even the means to cover 
themselves.</p>

responsible for my conduct to the Government I have served. I
have too high an idea of the greatness and the justice of the
First Magistrate of the French people, to doubt a moment of
its impartiality. I indulge the feeling that the balance in its
hands, will not incline to one side more than to another. I claim
its generosity.</p>

            <p>When he wrote this high-spirited letter, in which the writer
characteristically shows his concern for others more than for
himself,—and the tone of which contrasts favourably with that
which his oppressor, when fallen, and on the point of quitting
Europe for St. Helena, addressed in true French melodramatic
style to the English people,—Toussaint obviously had no idea of
the extent of the perfidy to which he was about to fall a victim.
He had been seized and carried off, but only, as he thought, that he
might be confronted with his maligners, and have a fair trial in
France. All he requested, therefore, was an impartial hearing,
assured that the even hand of Justice would repair the injuries
he had suffered. Little did he then foresee the dreadful end to
which he had been destined by the Consul's blind ambition.</p>
            <p>While on board the Hero, Toussaint wrote also to Admiral
Décrès, Minister of Marine and of the Colonies:—</p>

            <p>This simple and dignified letter is reported to have drawn
tears from the eyes of the minister. That minister felt the

contrast between the dark designs of the Government and the
unsuspicious tone of the communication. “Justice!” As well
ask mercy from tigers; as well seek grapes on a bramble-bush.</p>
            <p>As soon as the vessel arrived at Brest, the First Consul, glad
to have so formidable an enemy in his hands, gave free course
to his resentment. Without paying any respect to Toussaint's
character, fame, services, or former position, he, consulting only
his fears and selfish interests, tore him from his family, and
began the persecution which was to end in a most painful death.
Toussaint was immediately hurried on shore. On the 13th of
August, the maritime provost of Brest, at five in the morning,
sent an officer of police and four men to transfer the negro
chief from the vessel. On the deck only was he permitted to
have an interview with his wife and children, whom he was to
meet no more in this life. Only his servant was he allowed to
take with him. When in the boat, he bade a last adieu to
Madame Toussaint, to Isaac, to Saint-Jean, who then remained
on board the Hero, and extended his hand to Placide, whom
a cruel policy at the same moment was tearing from the arms of
his mother, and was conveying on board the corvette La Naïade
to Belle-Isle en Mer. In the evening, Placide learnt of the
removal of his father from the Hero. Previously, he had sent
the following letter to him, which was found under Toussaint's
pillow:—</p>

            <p>When he thus rudely broke up this amiable and interesting family,
the First Consul did not foresee that one day he would be torn
away from his wife and son. Curious coincidence in the destiny
of the oppressed and that of the oppressor! Bonaparte was
repaid in his own coin, nor in this instance merely—others have
presented themselves in our narrative. But what a 
“superfluity of naughtiness” have we here! why are all the members
of the L'Ouverture family involved in their father's ruin? And
if stern policy required their deportation from Hayti, why are
wife and children separated from their natural head, and why
should the aged captive be denied the companionship of her who
was the choice of his youth, became the comfort of his adult
age, and might still have supported his overladen heart to bear
his troubles? Was she severed from him expressly to exasperate 
his feelings, and augment his woes, making his load heavier,
the more surely and the more speedily to put an end to his
existence? Oh the depth of wickedness with which what is
called policy is chargeable! Reader, be not hoodwinked by
general terms. Policy would be nothing without politicians,
and when statesmen lose their manhood in state-craft, and
perpetrate, in their public capacity, wherein they have power,
deeds which they dare not attempt in their individual capacity,
wherein they are weak, then do they contract a criminality
which should make them abhorred by all good men, and which
is a virtual forfeiture of the tenure by which they hold their
high position. Office does not change the character of realities.
What is the painful reality here? It is nothing less than
theft. Toussaint L'Ouverture was stolen. The First Consul
was a man-stealer. He was more, he was a burglar: he broke
into Toussaint's house, and having ransacked and plundered it,
he stole the family, after having perfidiously carried off its head.
And having stolen father, mother, and children, he not only
separated them one from the other, but murdered, at least, the
father. This is plain speaking. At least, it is intended to be
so. Crime does not appear crime in men's eyes, unless it is
branded as crime. Therefore do I declare and proclaim, that
Bonaparte and his accomplices were, and for ever remain, guilty
<pb id="beard233" n="233"/>
of man-stealing, robbery, and murder, in their treacherous,
violent, and most wicked conduct towards this virtuous 
household.</p>
            <p>Madame Toussaint and her children were conveyed to
Bayonne, where they were placed under the supervision of
General Ducos. L'Ouverture, with his servant, Mars Plaisir,
was put on shore at Landerneau, where they were taken in
charge by two companies of cavalry. Compelled to quit 
immediately, Toussaint in one carriage and Mars in another, set
out for Paris under a strong guard. At Guingamp, some
officers of the eighty-second, who had served under Toussaint
L'Ouverture's orders, prevailed on the commander to stop the
cavalcade, that they might enjoy the opportunity of saluting
their old general. The permission was accorded. This was the
only solace that the captive enjoyed on the French soil. He
reached Paris on the 17th of August, and was immediately
imprisoned in the Temple. Thence, without any interview with
Bonaparte or his ministers, and without the slightest explanation 
he was hurried away into the department of Jura, and 
consigned to the dungeons of the castle of Joux. Singular caprice
of what is called history, at that very hour the same prison
held in chains Rigaud, the rival and the foe of Toussaint.
Separated in the busy hours of public life, Toussaint and
Rigaud were united by misfortune. And yet the union was
little more than nominal, for they were too powerful, even in a
dungeon, to be allowed to confer together. Suffering deserves
compassion even when it cannot command respect. Therefore,
I leave Rigaud to his endurance, without commenting on his
guilt in joining Leclerc's marauding enterprise. Rigaud and
Toussaint, the first a man of colour, the second a negro, but
for your skin, or rather but for European prejudice against
your skin, you would not have come to your present unhappy
condition. You are dark in hue, therefore are you persecuted.
Distinguished representatives of your respective races, there are
still men who deal in the like of you as they deal in pigs, in
poultry, in flocks, and in herds, and there are others who
justify this traffic in human flesh on the ground that your
<pb id="beard234" n="234"/>
epidermis contains a colouring matter of a somewhat deeper
shade than their own. Yes, to this issue the question comes
at last. How long, O reason, shall so patent and flimsy a
pretext prevail? A brown complexion, commonly called white,
ensures and justifies personal immunity and personal freedom;
a rather deeper brown, and a complexion of a somewhat sable
tinge, ensures and justifies the loss of personal liberty, and
therein the loss of all the rights, privileges, and possibilities of
manhood. Nay more, the former may buy and sell, oppress,
maim, mutilate, brand, scourge, imprison, and even kill the
latter; and that, too, not only with perfect impunity, but with
all the high bearing of unquestionable right. The relation of
master and slave, when reduced to its last link, is the relation
of simply more or less in the hues of the skin, of which the
varieties are so very numerous, and which extend from the
fair Circassian to the raven-black negro. Where, in this 
minutely graduated scale, is the point at which liberty ends, and
slavery begins? And who has fixed that point? And on what
authority? In truth, slavery in its origin and in its essence
is simply man-stealing, is robbery of the very worst kind; it is
the strong preying on the weak; it is the law of the bludgeon,
the bayonet, the fetter, the prison, the ship, the gallows. 
Bonaparte, in carrying off Toussaint L'Ouverture, did no more than
his African prototypes in power did before him, and, alas!
continue to do to the present hour. One and all, he as well
as they, and they not more than he, are robbers and plunderers.
What then are those who purchase the stolen goods? And
what they who grow rich and fatten on the system? Let men,
then, renounce the Christian name, or change from the top to
the bottom a “domestic institution,” which, having piracy and
theft for its basis, and violence for its support, stands in flagrant
contradiction to the clearest precepts, the simplest doctrines,
and the fundamental principles of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>As soon as the carrying off of L'Ouverture was known in
St. Domingo, General Belair, in the mountains of Saint Marc;
Colonel Sans-Souci, at Valière; the chief of the battalion of
Noel, at Dondon, took up arms as by one accord, and set in
<pb id="beard235" n="235"/>
movement the population of those districts. The latter made
his way as far as Ennery, overcoming all opposition in his route,
and augmenting his troops at every step. A multitude of men
and women who followed him, at the sight of the French 
garrison, made the hills of Ennery resound with their cries of woe,
indignation, and vengeance. Sans-Souci had no sooner drawn
his sword than he was arrested, as well as General Baradat, by
Christophe, sent to the Cape, and embarked for France. Belair
was at the head of considerable forces, when Dessalines, who
was despatched from the Cape against him, came into the
mountains of Saint Marc, and requested a colloquy; Belair,
hoping that the interview might bring a similarity of 
sentiments to light, acceded to the request. He thus fell into the
snare laid against him by Dessalines. He was arrested; and,
with his wife, conveyed to the Cape, where they were both
shot. Thus perished General Charles Belair, the victim of his
devotion to Toussaint, and of his confidence in Dessalines. A
model of friendship, with bravery, and military talents, he
united the qualities which make a good and amiable man.
Toussaint, well pleased with his conduct when he was his 
aide-de-camp, once said to him, “Charles, you have acted to-day
like Labienus.” “General,” he replied, “I hope I shall be
more faithful to you than Labienus at last proved to Cæsar.”
The hope became a reality. Other less distinguished, but
worthy and faithful friends of Toussaint L'Ouverture, impelled
to espouse his cause, suffered death in ways which soldiers
account disgraceful.</p>
            <p>Society exacts from bad men an account of their deeds,
and bad men, unable to give a satisfactory account, feel it
necessary to put forth at any cost colourable pretexts. Leclerc
could not endure the voice of public opinion, even as it existed
in Saint Domingo. He had treacherously seized, and hastily sent
from the island, one who had been both its hero and its pacificator. 
The evil work given him to perform by his brother-in-law, 
he had fully executed. Yet did he fear men's tongues.
As a palliation of the misdeed, he set abroad a statement that
Toussaint was plotting against the peace of the island. What
<pb id="beard236" n="236"/>
was the evidence? A fabrication. Two letters, said to be
written by Toussaint, and intercepted, were put into circulation.
The fraud has come down to these days; it is so clumsy as to
bear its own condemnation on its front. If the authenticity of
these letters were ascertained, they prove nothing to Toussaint's
disadvantage. Even the most tortuous interpretation could not
extract from them a valid suspicion. But their broken and
scattered words only show to what extremities their fabricators
were driven, in the fear of detection. And so far as their sense
can be made out, neither the ideas nor the style corresponds
with the warm, energetic, rapid, and figurative manner of
Toussaint L'Ouverture. The fabricator was some poor mean
creature, who was utterly unable to give to his wretched 
composition the most superficial mark of that genius which appears
in all that we possess of Toussaint's writing or dictation. 
However, the fragments in some way served their purpose, in turning
attention from Leclerc's perfidy to the allegation of evil designs
on the part of his victim. Even if the evidence were less worthless 
than it is, the presumption would be against the Captain-general, 
who shunned a public investigation, and condemned
unheard a man to whom he had solemnly pledged his honour.</p>
            <p>The blacks, guided by a simple sense of right and justice,
gave no credence to the alleged conspiracy, and saw the blood
of innocent men and women shed with alarm and indignation.
At the same time, they lost all trust in Leclerc, for had they
not seen their Liberator seized and sent away, contrary to the
obligations of an oath, the claims of a solemn compact, and the
sacred rights of hospitality?</p>

            <argument>
              <p>Leclerc tries to rule by creating jealousy and division—Ill-treats the men of
colour—Disarms the blacks—An insurrection ensues, and gains head, until it
wrests from the violent hands of the general nearly all his possessions—
Leclerc dies—Bonaparte resolves to send a new army to Saint Domingo.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>As the news of the deportation of Toussaint L'Ouverture spread
abroad, secret and deep discontent began to prevail, which
threatened disturbance, if not disaster. In vain Leclerc tried to
prevent these consequences of his own misdeeds, by a slow 
concealed tyranny. He created division among the black chiefs
by insinuating into their violent natures rivalry, jealousy, and
hatred; he set the ambition of one in opposition to the moderation 
of another; now he brought into contrast this man's fidelity
with that man's want of fidelity; mingling adroitly together
praises and enticements, favours and disgrace, encouraging and
rewarding mutual accusations. Special pains did he take to
revive the old animosities between the blacks and the men of
colour; animosities which in reality were only a consequence of
the difference in the servitude to which they were in common
subject. As a result of this Machiavellian policy, many officers of
black and of mixed blood were persecuted, imprisoned, or banished
to a distance. Of this number was Rigaud, next to Toussaint
the most renowned of all. He was arrested in the port of Saint
Marc, whither he had been sent as if to take a command. In his
indignation, he threw his sword into the sea, to prevent its being
sullied by traitors. He was sent to France, and curiously enough,
was, as we have seen, cast into the prison which held Toussaint
L'Ouverture. Lamartinière, who had displayed the virtues of a
champion of liberty behind the walls of Crête-a-Pierrot, was 
massacred in an ambuscade. Thus was manifested the hatred of the
colonists against men whom they could not endure to see in the 
enjoyment of freedom. That hatred was fostered by the Consul, and
by his representative Leclerc. Of special consequence did the
Captain-general consider the disarming of the blacks; but the
<pb id="beard238" n="238"/>
step was one of extreme difficulty. Men, whose passions are
excited, and whose future is uncertain, do not easily surrender
their arms. Cajolery and mutual distrust were put into action;
the result was, that thirty thousand muskets were collected
and laid up in the common armoury. But in the midst of the
operation, discontent was displayed, menaces were uttered, 
sedition was fostered, risings took place; the Government was 
compelled to employ vigour as well as adroitness. Troops were set
in movement, blacks who were in subjection were employed
against others who were ripe for revolt; some sullenly gave up
their arms, others hid them, waiting their opportunity. 
Ferocious bands were formed, who practised all kinds of atrocities.
The disarming succeeded best in the south; in the west it was
very partial; the coloured population, distrustful and disquieted,
especially since the deportation of Rigaud, betook themselves to
the mountains; then most unjust and injudicious severities were
exercised; suspicions sufficed for the infliction of death; the
scaffolds were loaded with victims of both sexes, and of all ages.
Several of the wives of the officers of the seventh colonial brigade
were publicly executed. After capturing Belair, Dessalines
slaughtered three hundred blacks and men of colour in the vale
of the Artibonite, to avenge the death of some European soldiers,
massacred within the country under his command. Meanwhile,
an impression had been obtaining prevalence that the disarming
and other offensive measures were parts of a system intended to
issue in the restoration of slavery. Some imprudent colonists,
whom experience of evil had not taught anything but revenge,
uttered in one of their assemblies the old maxim—“No slavery,
no colony.” The alarm caused thereby was augmented by news
that slavery had been restored in other French dependencies,
and that even the slave-trade was resumed. Under the growing
fears and distrust, some applied to purchase their freedom. The
request was refused by their former owners. “We are then,”
said mothers of families, with tears in their eyes, “we are then
about to fall back into slavery.” To prevent the calamity, the
blacks made such preparation as they could. Circumstances
were in their favour; a malady which had gone far to destroy
<pb id="beard239" n="239"/>
the army and the fleet; the rainy season, which was at hand,
not less baneful to the whites than favourable to the blacks; the
asylum of the mountains, where their foes would pursue them
almost in vain. Full of fear yet full of courage, they spoke to
each other words of exhortation: “Do they expect to find slaves
in us? why did they not leave us at large in our forests? Was
Africa, our native land, weary of us? Have our rivers been dried
up? Did not our flocks, our fields, did not hunting and fishing
suffice for our wants? We learnt no other wants but at the
price of our liberty; they have deceived us in our simplicity by
poisoned gifts. Were not our feet accustomed, unshod, to walk
over burning sands; and did not our uncovered heads brave the
fires of the torrid zone? Our skin, given by nature to enable
us to live near the sun, performed the office of garments 
fabricated by luxury. Was not the limpid wave of our fountains
preferable to the liquors which cause brutal fury? To enjoy the
sweet manifestations of friendship, the guileless smile of our
children, the caresses of a mother who, during three years, 
nurtured us with her milk; to trouble neither our own lot nor the
lot of others; to pass our life without fear and without desires,
as a river of a tranquil and uniform flow—such were the precious
advantages of which we have been robbed by our enemies.”
While thus they inflamed each other by fancy pictures of their
ancestral mode of life, they drew a too true and a very painful
contrast in adverting to their actual condition. Here a man
held forth his arm, mutilated by a barbarous monster; there
another pointed to his leg, eaten into by the links of an iron
chain; others drew attention to the scars left by the driver's
thong; women uncovered their breasts, which showed traces
of the branding-iron,—the breasts which had suckled their
masters' children. And then, with what pride did they turn to
the blessings of freedom! “Heaven, in its pity, has given us a
new country in this land of exile, of grief, and of shame shall
it be torn from us?”</p>
            <p>Soon the standard of revolt was raised. At first the banner
was unfurled by obscure men who occasioned little solicitude.
But civil wars are pregnant with great leaders. In the 
<pb id="beard240" n="240"/>
mountains of Saint Domingo there were always tribes of untamed
Africans, who had thrown off the yoke of slavery. At the head
of one of these tribes was Lamour de Rance, an adroit, stern,
savage man, half-naked, with epaulettes tied by a cord, for his
only token of authority. At home in the mountains, he passed
from one to the other with something of the ease of one of their
own birds. Toussaint himself had in vain pursued him in those
retreats, whose proper inhabitants are wild beasts; that chief
acknowledged no other authority than that which nature gave,
in no way thinking or caring about monarchy or republicanism.
His tender of obedience to the Government had been a matter
of mere form. His dress, his manners, his character, his mode
of fighting, at the Cape, where he just showed himself, were
objects of curiosity and amusement with the French army. A
greater insult could not be given than to ask this savage warrior
for his arms. Were they not the protectors of his life? He
avenged the insult by carrying fire and sword over the Highlands
in the vicinity of Port-au-Prince. In the plain of Léogane he
reduced to ashes more than a hundred plantations; he carried
off the labourers, and inflicted barbarous cruelties on the whites.</p>
            <p>The revolt extended. In the north, as well as in the south
and the west, it broke out and spread devastation. As reports
of these insurrections got abroad at the Cape and Port-au-Prince, 
consternation increased. News was eagerly sought after,
though almost always the source of fresh anxiety. Some reported
that they had seen on fire the mountains which overhang 
Port-au-Prince; others that Lamour de Rance had reduced to ashes
the plantations of Léogane. This day brought intelligence that
Sans-Souci was in arms at Vallière; the next that Noël had
seized Dondon and Sylla Plaisance. “You have heard that
Macaya raises the country around Port-de-Paix?” “No; but
a band of insurgents is spreading terror in the island of Tortue.”
More lamentable still were the narratives which some had to
give how their brothers, their wives, their children, had been
massacred with an incredible refinement of cruelty.</p>
            <p>The general alarm was exaggerated by the colonists, who,
forgetful of the share they had had in causing it, and that but
<pb id="beard241" n="241"/>
for them there would have been no conquest of the island, no
violation of oaths, no intention of restoring slavery, accused (as
is the custom of such men) their destiny, the Government,
Heaven, every object but themselves, the real sources of all
these evils. “Heaven, then,” they said, “has not ceased to 
persecute us; have we not suffered enough during ten years of
exile and misery? Shall we always be driven into flight, or be
massacred by our ferocious slaves? Was there ever a similar
succession of reverses and misfortunes? Are we not the most
unfortunate of men? Our slaves are before our eyes kindling
incendiary torches, and twice have we seen our plantations and
our towns burned to the ground. Why does not the Government
act with decision? Why leave us to certain and speedy 
destruction?” Then they invoked the aid of the black chiefs who
remained attached to their party, and who replied to them only
by a fierce silence or by dissimulation. But always allowing
themselves to be borne away by vengeance, they surrounded the
Captain-general with their pernicious counsels, and he, instead
of employing clemency and mildness, made use only of arms and
punishments. In the cities scaffolds were raised, which were
bathed in the blood of the blacks. They even executed women
and children, whose only crime was that they had brothers,
fathers, or husbands, among the revolters; they were accused
of corresponding with them—the penalty of such intercourse
was death. Port-au-Prince, in consternation at the ravages of
Lamour de Rance, became the special theatre of executions.
All suffered death with intrepidity, calmness, and resignation.
The more numerous the executions, the more extensive were the
desertions. Instead of terrifying they exasperated; they fed
the insurrection, though they intended to suppress it.</p>
            <p>While the scaffolds were crowded with victims, Leclerc applied
to Dessalines for assistance. He went to the Cape, and renewed
his protestations of fidelity and devotedness. Cruel as false, the
monster declared that he thirsted for the blood of the revolters.
In a moment when his indignation had gained the mastery, and
the agitation of his members manifested more rage than even
his words, the General-in-chief said to him in transport, “The
<pb id="beard242" n="242"/>
troops which I expect from France will give me the power of
striking a terrible blow.” “There shall be,” shouted Dessalines,
in fury, “a general earthquake!” A Government that stimulates
and employs such wretches condemns itself and forfeits its
authority. Instead of carrying on the war honourably, Dessalines 
pretended to entertain feelings in favour of the revolt.
By this means it was that he entrapped General Belair.</p>
            <p>While Dessalines was subduing mounts Cahos, Leclerc ordered
Rochambeau to punish Lamour de Rance; but the troops who
went in pursuit of him, saw only vast fields of fire which covered
his flight. When circumstances suggested, the barbarians 
sheltered themselves in the heart of precipitous mountains, which
were to them fortifications stronger than any which the art of
man ever constructed. All that could be done was to oppose
some limit to the ravages of the foe in the west and the south,
the frontiers of which two provinces he had laid waste.</p>
            <p>At the same time the captain of the expedition, seconded by
Christophe and Maurepas, employed all his efforts both to put
down the sedition in the Isle of Tortue, and to arrest the 
progress of the revolt in the north. But Sans-Souci was an
African not less agile than Lamour do Rance. He also covered
his flight with deserts and flames; he did not, however, fear to try
actual combat. Twice he defeated the troops sent against him.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile the black generals still attached to the French
preserved only a suspected fidelity, and barely concealed their
disquietude. Christophe, afraid of being arrested like Toussaint,
did not accept Leclerc's invitation to a banquet, until he had
directed his troops to be in readiness for a sudden blow. An
officer who sat next him at table, took pleasure in filling his
glass. Christophe, suspecting an evil design, turned to him in
rage, and said, “Dost thou know, thou little white thing, that
if I had drunk the wine which thou pouredst out for me, I
should have desired to drink thy blood and that of thy general?”
These words caused great agitation among the guests. Leclerc
reproached Christophe with what he called Toussaint's treason,
and commanded the officers of his guard to run to arms. “Vain
is it to call your soldiers,” the chief replied; “mine are under
<pb id="beard243" n="243"/>
arms, and with a single word I can make you a prisoner; but,
as to my betraying you, learn to know me, I remain subject
to you as I was to Toussaint; had he said to me, ‘Hurl this
island into the sea,’ I would have done my best. This is the
way I obey or command. The faith of oaths and treaties—
security of person—sacred rights of hospitality—has not all been
violated by your cruel policy? Prison, banishment, death, are
the rewards of those whose blood flows for our liberty. No
longer are you around me, friends, soldiers, heroes of our 
mountains! And thou, Toussaint, the pride of our race, the terror
of our enemies—thou whose genius led us from slavery to
liberty—thou whose hand adorned peace with lovely virtues—
thou whose glory fills the world, they have put thee in irons like
the vilest criminal! But what is there in common between
you, Captain-general, and Toussaint? Your name came amongst
us only as his who turned parricidal arms against the 
representatives of your country. It is this crime, doubtless, that
the Consul wished to reward in giving you the government of
Saint Domingo.” These were bold words to be spoken at the
Governor's table. The guests looked astounded. Leclerc, alarmed
in his inmost soul, affected composure.</p>
            <p>In truth, the condition of the colony was lamentable. The
fever continued its wasting career. The Government every day
lost power, while its enemies increased. Suspicion and alarm
opened on every hand. This state of things finds a good description 
in the words of an eyewitness. Thus does General Pamphile
de Lacroix speak: “I was invited to the heights of the Cape by
General Boudet, whom the General-in-chief was sending to
France to acquaint the Government with the true condition of
the island. At the house of General Boudet I found Generals
Clervaux and Christophe. I asked them the cause of the progress
of the insurrection. The latter replied, ‘You are a European,
and you are young; you have fought merely in the armies of
the mother country; you, consequently, cannot have any 
prejudices regarding slavery. I will therefore speak to you with
frankness. The revolt grows because distrust is at its height.
If you had our skin, you would not, perhaps, be so confiding as
<pb id="beard244" n="244"/>
myself, who am intrusting my only son, Ferdinand, to General
Boudet that he may be educated in France. I make no account
of the brigands who have given the signal for the insurrection.
The danger lies not there; the danger is in the general opinion
of the blacks; those of Saint Domingo are frightened because
they know the decree of the 30th Floréal, which maintains
slavery and the slave-trade in the colonies restored to France by
the treaty of Amiens. They are alarmed at seeing the First
Consul re-establish the old system in those colonies. They are
afraid lest the indiscreet talk that is heard here on all sides
should find its way to France, and suggest to the Government
the idea of depriving the blacks of Saint Domingo of their
liberty.’ In order to pique his self-love, I asked him how it
was that he, who had so much influence in the south, should not
have found troops sufficiently devoted to put Sans-Souci into
his hands? His reply struck me: ‘If Sans-Souci was a soldier,
I might get hold of him; but he is a mean and cruel brigand,
who has no scruple to kill whomsoever he suspects; he knows
when to fly, and he knows how to cover his flight with the
deserts which he leaves behind him. He goes about the affair
better than we did at the time of your disembarcation. If, then,
instead of fighting, our system of resistance had consisted in
flight, and in well alarming the blacks, you would never have
been able to overtake us. So said old Toussaint: no one 
believed him. We possessed arms; the pride of making use of
them was our ruin. These new insurgents follow the system of
Toussaint; if they persist in it, we shall have difficulty to 
reduce them.’</p>
            <p>“General Christophe urged me not to return that evening to
Fort Dauphin; saying, that the revolters having attacked his
posts in the plain, were probably informed of my journey. I
thanked him; but urging that the danger would be greater 
to-morrow, I said that I should return as soon as I had seen the
General- in-chief. General Leclerc acquainted me with his
melancholy situation, congratulating himself in seeing none but
bandits among the new chiefs of the insurrection, and added,
that in the feeble state of the forces of the mother country, he was
<pb id="beard2452" n="245"/>
glad to find the generals of colour still faithful to France. On
my way to Saint Michel, I stopped at General Christophe's, who
hearing discharges of fire-arms in the mountains, repeated his
request that I would not that evening press on to Fort Dauphin.
I persisted in my intention. He then ordered six of his guides
to accompany me. ‘Bear in mind,’ he said to them repeatedly,
‘that you are escorting a general whom I esteem and love.’</p>
            <p>“We set out. Of a sudden the guides, who led the way
with torches, stopped before a detachment of thirty blacks,
who had concealed themselves in a ditch. Forthwith one heard
the words, ‘Halt! stop! halt!’ Shots succeeded. The 
commanding officer meanwhile recognised in Don Diego Polanco,
who was with me, an old friend. We were saved. But I had
seen reason to believe that the chiefs of the colonial troops and
the coloured generals had communications with the insurgents.</p>
            <p>“Too frequently did the Europeans speak of the reinforcements
captured from France for the blacks not to perceive the need in
which we stood of them.”</p>
            <p>The news of the events which had taken place at Guadaloupe,
the maintenance of slavery at Martinique, indiscreet talk, and
insinuations from foreigners, fomented distrust in the minds of
the black chiefs. The words which the First Consul had 
addressed to the Abbé Grégoire, at an<sic corr="official"> officeal</sic> presentation at the
Institute, were repeated in the colony: “From what is taking
place in Saint Domingo, I wish the friends of the blacks throughout 
Europe had their heads covered with mourning crape.”
The words struck men's imaginations. The minds of the blacks
and of the men of colour were at the height of disquietude when
the frigate, Cocarde, entered the roads, having on board blacks
sent from Guadaloupe; many of them in the night jumped into
the sea, swam to shore, and by their reports made the alarm
still greater. At the same time, some men of colour, also from
Guadaloupe, brought to Saint Domingo information that the
slave-trade in that island comprehended their caste. Here
were dark presages of what might be expected in Saint Domingo,
The fidelity of the chiefs of the Colonial troops was from that
hour irrevocably shaken.</p>
            <pb id="beard246" n="246"/>
            <p>General Clervaux, who had recently condemned Charles
Belair to death, first threw off the mask by deserting. The
evening before, being at Madame Leclerc's, he had said in a fit
of passion, “I was free formerly; only to new circumstances do
I owe it that I have raised up my reviled colour; but if I 
fancied that here the restoration of slavery would ever be thought
of, that instant I would become a brigand.”</p>
            <p>Judge, if you can, of the position of Captain-general Leclerc;
he knew the danger, he could not prevent it. The crews were
not sufficient for the service of the ships. The garrison of the
Cape did not comprise more than two hundred Europeans; there
were in it fifteen hundred colonial soldiers. On the night of
the 13th-14th of September (1802), Pétion, that coolly audacious
chief, threw all into confusion at the Cape, spiked the guns, and
disarmed the European cannoniers.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref16" n="16" rend="sc" target="note16">*</ref></p>
            <note id="note16" n="16" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref16"><foreign lang="fre">*Mémoire</foreign>s, vol. ii. 224, seq.</note>
            <p>Two days after, Clervaux and Pétion made an attack on the
Cape, but failed to capture it. So well were they received by
Brigadier Anhouil that, thinking they were opposed by the fresh
troops expected from France, they drew off their forces which, if
pressed forward, must have been overwhelming, so superior were
they in number to the defenders of the colonial metropolis. At
the moment of the attack, Leclerc, as a measure of precaution,
sent on board vessels in the harbour, whose crews had been greatly
reduced by the fever, detachments of the colonial soldiers who had
remained at the Cape. The sailors, panic-struck, cried out, “Let us
kill those who may kill us.” They fell on the black soldiers,
and ruthlessly drowned of them more than a thousand.</p>
            <p>Then Christophe, already prepared for defection, and lately
standing, to use his phrase, <hi rend="italics">as a benevolent spectator,</hi> in other
words, watching the right moment, joined Clervaux. A few
days after Dessalines threw himself into opposition.</p>
            <p>The insurrection became general. The entire population was
the enemy of France. The mother, the daughter, the child,
as well as the father, and the brother, all were soldiers. The
woods were their camps, dens their dwellings; the mountains
<pb id="beard247" n="247"/>
their ramparts; they found their food in the spontaneous
products of the earth; they transmuted into arms the instruments 
of agriculture. Stones hurled from the rocks served
them instead of artillery. They threw their whole life into
assaults, combats, and ambuscades. A new future was before
them. “Death or liberty!” again became their rallying cry.
Everywhere the insurgents repulsed, and laid waste the enemies
of their freedom, They captured Poit-de-Paix, Gonaïves, Fort
Dauphin. In the evacuation of the last place, General de
Lacroix was obliged in his extremity to destroy powder and
provisions to the value of two millions of francs. Escaping by
sea to the Cape, he lost in the short voyage sixty-six sick 
persons, who were thrown into the sea. The first words which
Leclerc addressed to him on landing them were, “General, what
have you done? You bring a coloured population four times
more numerous than your Europeans; you do not know then
that they are tigers, serpents, that you bear in your bosom.”</p>
            <p>Leclerc felt that the colony was escaping out of his hands. Of
all his conquests there remained only, in the North, the Cape,
and Môle Saint-Nicholas, and in the West, Port-au-Prince, and
Saint Marc. But for the colonists, who then appeared with
arms in their hands, all was over.</p>
            <p>At the prospect the Captain-general was greatly alarmed.
He looked everywhere for succour. In his perplexity he sent
to an enemy's camp to beg the aid of Christophe, offering him
honours and riches. Christophe contented himself with replying, 
that he was rich and honoured enough in possessing liberty
himself, and in securing the liberty of his colour.</p>
            <p>Shortly, Christophe put himself at the head of the insurgents,
and proceeded to attack the Cape. Then was Leclerc on the
land side shut up within the walls of the capital. Scarcely did
he possess vessels sufficient for flight.</p>
            <p>Such was the condition of Hayti, when, in the first of November, 
1802, the Captain-general, worn down by fatigue and pains,
and overwhelmed with vexation, disappointment, and despair,
breathed his last, as the final result of a sickness which had long
threatened to prove fatal. A little before his death he expressed
<pb id="beard248" n="248"/>
his regret for the errors committed by himself in the government. 
Regret now utterly vain; errors which had proved
disastrous to all the great interests of the colony. Nor less 
disastrous to France was this iniquitous expedition. Of 
four-and-thirty thousand warriors, twenty-four thousand had perished,
and eight thousand were in the hospitals; scarcely more than
two thousand were fit for service.</p>
            <p>Amid this thick darkness, and surrounded by these vengeful
penalties, the Captain-general passed to a tribunal before which
diversities of skin are unknown. Leclerc wanted neither sense
nor manners. He possessed an easy eloquence which threw
light on the discussions of his council-chamber. But he was
little acquainted with the human heart; and was unable to 
interpret the peculiar character of Africans. In war he was
active, uncertain, and presumptuous. Blindly obedient to the
wishes of the First Consul, he made peace consist of a complication 
of troubles, divisions, treachery, and violence. By these
deplorable crimes, he was reduced to the state of impotence
which has been described. As he had none of the qualities of a
great commander, a funeral oration pronounced in his honour
before a few soldiers, who had escaped from the fever and the
sword, was a mere harmonious assemblage of idle words.</p>
            <p>Pauline, Leclerc's wife, affected the marks of extraordinary
mourning, but she betrayed appearances by choosing for her
companion one of the most handsome men of the army, and
returned to her ordinary habits of luxury, pleasure, and 
voluptuousness. After having had her husband's body embalmed, she
crossed the sea to France. When her vessel appeared at 
Marseilles, the inhabitants at the sight of the Consul's sister, a
widow, so young, in tears, manifested their sorrow by decorating
the port and the streets with crape and funereal garlands. The
tokens of sadness had been commanded, but they had some
reality, for many of them had seen her grow up to adolescence
within their walls.</p>
            <p>In mournful procession she entered Paris. Brothers, sisters,
and wives, then shed true tears at the remembrance of sons,
brothers, and husbands, whom they had lost in the expedition.
<pb id="beard249" n="249"/>
Pauline herself let some tears fall when she saw her brother,
who embraced her with joy and tenderness. Then she spoke to
him eloquently of Saint Domingo as a land of fire, blood,
and desolation. The Consul heard her in silence, and said,
“Here is all that remains of that fine army—the body of a
brother-in-law, of a general, my right arm, a handful of dust;
all has perished, all will perish. Fatal conquest! cursed land!
perfidious colonists! a wretched slave in revolt! These are
the causes of so many evils.” He concealed from himself for a
moment that he had sent away so many brave warriors that they
might not throw their bayonets across the road to the imperial
throne, whither he was urged by his impetuous desires.</p>
            <p>Soon his mind arose from that dejection, and in the immensity
of the future which his genius embraced, he regarded the calamities 
of Saint Domingo only as an unlucky but useful incident.
Had he not thrown into prison Toussaint, the chief and the soul
of the revolt? The fever had nearly consumed its fuel; 
Rochambeau, whose character he knew, would terrify the island
into obedience. Those wandering bands of insurgents, without a
head, without union, divided among themselves, would desert the
mountains to enjoy the pleasures of the cities. Besides, did he
not possess the two heads of Saint Domingo, the South and the
Spanish territory? Had he no more soldiers, no more ships?
Let twenty thousand men fly over the ocean. Thus Bonaparte
prepared for the loss of a second army. Blind ambition, reckless
of its means, reckless of the misery it occasions! Meanwhile
the First Consul deposited Leclerc's corpse amid much pomp in
the Panthéon, and erected statues to his memory. The greater
the calamities of Hayti, the more he endeavoured to efface the
recollection of them by show and pomp, and by the aid of those
arts which ought to transmit to posterity the memory only of
truly great men.</p>

            <argument>
              <p>Rochambeau assumes the command—His character—Voluptuousness, tyranny,
and cruelty—Receives large reinforcements—Institutes a system of terror—
The insurrection becomes general and irresistible—The French are driven
out of the island.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>AFTER the death of Leclerc, the command of Hayti passed into
the hands of Rochambeau. That General was deformed in body,
but of a robust constitution; his manner was hard and severe,
though he had a propensity to voluptuousness. In his youth he
had, under the eyes of an illustrious father, served the cause of
independence in North America. He lacked neither ability nor
experience in war. He possessed tender, domestic, and friendly
affections. His good qualities would have accompanied him to
the tomb, if he had not been called to the government of Saint
Domingo. Regarding virtue as both lovely and requisite in 
private life, he judged it useless and even dangerous in public
affairs, as if the laws of eternal justice depended on position
and circumstances. Misled by this gross delusion, he feared not
to give himself up to acts of violation, spoliation, and cruelty of
all kinds. Blaming the tardy and hesitating administration of
his predecessor, he resolved to employ all the resources of terror
in order to establish his authority.</p>
            <p>Masters who had been impoverished by the freedom of the
slaves, saw with joy Rochambeau succeed a chief who, according
to circumstances, espoused or betrayed their personal interests.
But the blacks were disquieted when they knew that he had
taken the helm. Independently of the massacre he had
committed in the bay of Mancenille, they remembered that
when merely a general, he had not scrupled to degrade them with
the punishment of the lash; but what caused them greater
alarm were some words addressed in a tone of pleasantry, to
their wives at a festivity which he had given at Port-au-Prince.
“You,” he said, “are invited to dance at your interment.” A
<pb id="beard251" n="251"/>
hall hung with black, and lighted up by funeral torches, seemed
to them the image of their approaching sanguinary end.</p>
            <p>Despotism and sensuality have often been companions. In
Rochambeau the one sharpened the appetite for the other, as
though greediness of bodily pleasure welcomed the zest arising
from the sight of bodily pain. No small part of his time
Rochambeau passed at table, or on sofas, with Creole females,
worshippers of pleasure, as well as most cruel towards their
slaves. They spoke to him constantly of chains, prisons, the
scourge and other punishments, in the midst of games, laughter,
caresses, and senseless gratifications with which they intoxicated
his soul. As his policy inclined him to violence, he willingly
allowed himself to be overcome by the fascinations of these
women, as well as by irritated proprietors, who continually
pointed him to their houses in flames, and their slaves in revolt
in the mountains. Thus did he listen only to counsels of hatred
enforced by contempt and vice.</p>
            <p>The fever had changed the character of the army. The heart
of the soldier was worn by regret, fatigued by misfortune, and
filled with trouble; no longer had the noise and glitter of arms,
encampments, war, and victory, any attractions for him. A
bitter and savage melancholy had succeeded to the hilarity and
joy of courage and hope. Even officers of rank were seen to
disown authority and to favour a revolt, which they judged 
legitimate. But Rochambeau, who required a blind submission,
dismissed those the firmness of whose soul he doubted; thus
giving free course to tyranny in order to oppose an effectual
remedy to the evils he wished to put down.</p>
            <p>Up to this time punishment and violence had been covered
with a veil. Toussaint had not been arrested except as a result
of a pretended conspiracy; a military tribunal had condemned
Charles Belair. Those who had suffered death, had been
taken with arms in their hands, or had kept up communications 
with the insurgents. In truth many women and
children were in the number of the victims, but they were
at least implicated by some accusation, and it was through fear
rather than cruelty that disarmed soldiers had been drowned at
<pb id="beard252" n="252"/>
the Cape. But from this time there was no longer any study of
appearances; law, judges, and tribunals were ceremonies too
circuitous and too tardy.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile Rochambeau, who received in different detachments 
fresh troops, to the number of 20,000 men, sent them
under different circumstances against the revolters, whom he
drove away from the country around Port-au-Prince, Mole 
Saint-Nicholas, and the heights which overhung the Cape. As he
was most eager to signalize his command by some victory, he
retook Fort Dauphin and Port-de-Paix without any memorable
action. This was the term of his success. The blacks without
regret, abandoned fortresses which to them seemed contemptible
in comparison with their rocks. But in the degree in which
they were repulsed at one point, they extended towards another,
so that they only acquired accessions of strength. But what
was more for their encouragement and advantage, was that they
were furnished with arms by English vessels. Rochambeau
thought that there was no surer means to repress their ardour
than to affright them by some extraordinary punishment.</p>
            <p>The sea off the Cape was chosen to be the theatre of an 
execution, unparalleled in what is called civilized life. For fear that
Maurepas, who had gained distinction under Toussaint L'Ouverture, 
after having embraced the side of France, should join the
insurgents, Leclerc had written to him to come by sea, with his
family and his troop, to take the command of the Cape, which
he destined for him as a reward for his services. No sooner had
he arrived than he and his soldiers were seized and disarmed.
Rochambeau ordered preparations to be made for a barbarous
punishment, in order to put the negro general to death, with his
troop, consisting of 400 blacks. It was also put in deliberation
whether death should be inflicted on his children, in order to
prevent them from rising up to avenge their father.</p>
            <p>After having been bound to the mast of a vessel, Maurepas
was frightfully insulted. His wife, his children, and his soldiers
were brought to be drowned under his eyes. The executioners
were astounded when they beheld a father fix his dying eyes by
turns on his children, his wife, and his companions in arms,
<figure id="ill7" entity="beard252"><p>REVENGE OF THE FRENCH ON THE BLACKS.</p></figure>
<pb id="beard253" n="253"/>
undergoing a violent death; while they, on their part, turned
their eyes away from a father, a husband, a general, whose 
countenance was disfigured by the tortures he was enduring. After
being made to contemplate each other's sufferings, they were all
tossed into the ocean. They died without complaining, in a
manner worthy the champions of liberty. With a reversal of
the order of nature, the father died last; he also suffered most.</p>
            <p>Thus died Maurepas, whose character was a compound of
frankness and severity. Thrice had he repulsed the French at
the gorge of Trois-Rivières; he had at once the glory and the
misfortune to go over to the French with victorious arms. The
elevation of his soul equalled his valour. He preserved a tender
feeling for the master whose slave he had been; he caused
funeral honours to be paid to that master, and when his grave
had been negligently prepared, he throw off his upper garment
in order to perform the pious office properly. Among men of his
own blood he was a powerful chief. A spirit of order and
justice prevailed in his life. His riches, which were considerable,
were given up to pillage. It would almost seem as if so much
excellence were subjected to so much ignominy, expressly to show
that while black men are capable of any virtue, white men are
capable of any crime. Certainly, my narrative is replete with
instances which, beyond a question, prove that moral as well as
mental excellence is independent of the varieties of colour.</p>
            <p>This brutal punishment, preceded by vile perfidy, filled the
camps of the insurgents with horror. That horror was 
augmented when Rochambeau, at the Cape, put to death five hundred
prisoners. On the place of execution, and under the eyes
of the victims, they dug a large hole for their grave, so that
the poor wretches may be said to have been present at their own
funeral.</p>
            <p>Dessalines burning to avenge Maurepas and his fellow-soldiers,
rushed like a lion on the Cape, and, in his impetuous and terrible
march, he surrounded and made prisoners a body of Frenchmen,
who, at the post called Belair, defended the approach to the city.
Then, with branches of trees, that ferocious African raised, under
the eyes of Rochambeau, five hundred gibbets, on which he
<pb id="beard254" n="254"/>
hanged the same number of prisoners. Of these victims of
vengeance, the greater number had been the Consul's companions
in arms; they had assisted that bad great man to acquire his
pretensions to a throne, and for their reward they had been sent
out of his way to suffer an ignominious and painful death at the
hands of a savage.</p>
            <p>Rochambeau, who occupied himself less and less with war,
continued to plunge into the delights of the table, and of 
voluptuousness with courtezans and wives of colonists who never
ceased to stimulate his tyranny, and exact from him the restoration 
of their slaves. Then, while the insurrection, in the name
of liberty, made head in the mountains, on the plains suspicion
converted everything into crime. If you went abroad, you
joined the revolters; if you stayed at home, you were waiting for
them; if you manifested joy, you took pleasure in the public
calamities; if you appeared sad, you grieved over the reverses
of the revolt; if you wrote letters, you corresponded with the
enemy; if you talked, you spread sedition; if you were observed
to listen, you were a spy; if you failed to salute a white, you
insulted a master: bravery was dangerous, weakness was 
complicity, innocence was stratagem. Interpretations were put on
a gesture, a smile, a sigh; silence was accused of sedition, and
even thoughts had no asylum in their last refuge, the human
heart.</p>
            <p>Such is the character of the tyranny which under the slightest
pretext and often by mere hazard, threw its toils round a 
multitude of victims without distinction of age or sex, to effect their
ruin. The number of sufferers was greatly augmented, because
colonists by a species of rivalry denounced the peaceful slaves of
other colonists, so that it became almost the sole business of
Rochambeau to order or even to devise punishments; the sea and
the land were covered with them. The unfortunate blacks were
bound together and then thrown into the sea to perish: if they
came up to the surface and made their way to the shore, they
were in sport pursued and massacred. The executions were
varied: now the blacks were beheaded, now they were dragged
down into the depths by the weight of a shot tied to their feet;
and now they were stifled by sulphur on ship-board.</p>
            <pb id="beard255" n="255"/>
            <p>Among the number of these victims were female priests, who
worshipped African fetish idols. That veneration for the gods
of their fathers was punished with death; so little does unbelief
guarantee toleration. A French general, touched with compassion 
at the approaching death of one of these superstitious but
well-meaning women, implored that her life might be spared.
Rochambeau, taking into his hands the pigmy idols of her 
worship, said, “How can I save the life of one who worships these!”
Yet during the fever these very women had bestowed every attention 
on sick French soldiers. Unhappy women, their charity
had no other recompense than the punishment which is reserved
for the vilest crimes. Base ingratitude of the commander!
Here, again, on which side is the moral superiority? Oh, 
civilization, what crimes have been committed in thy name! Ye
weak ones, whose “feeble knees” a Christian authority 
commands Christian men to strengthen (Heb. xii. 12), how have
indignities and woes been heaped on your heads, simply because
ye were weak, not only by sceptics and scoffers, but even by
professed believers in a divine religion!</p>
            <p>The numerous executions which began at Cape City soon
extended to other places; Port-au-Prince had its salt waters
made bloody, and scaffolds were erected and loaded within and
without its walls. The hand of tyranny spread terror and death
over the shores of the north and the west. As the insurrection
became more daring, it was thought that the punishments had
not been either numerous enough, violent enough, or various
enough. The colonists counselled and encouraged vengeance as
if it was their wealth.</p>
            <p>All human passions were let loose. Never was such a spectacle
of ferocity beheld. The calm, concentrated, impassible revolt
which followed the death of Leclerc, had committed only particular
acts of revenge; but at the sight of punishments so numerous
and so horrible, insurrection roared and raged on all sides. Men,
scarcely anything else than barbarians, made the mountains 
resound with this death song:—
<q direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“Open, ye sepulchres of our ancestors; ye dusty bones, shudder;</l><l>Vengeance! vengeance t reply the tombs and all nature.”</l></lg></q>
<pb id="beard256" n="256"/>
With shouts of joy they ran to battle, and impatient to avenge
their colour, they seized the enemies of their liberty, and cast
them to the earth to perish. The South was once more on fire.</p>
            <p>At the same time, at the Cape, at Fort Dauphin, at Port-de-Paix, 
at Saint Marc, at Port-au-Prince, and all along the shores,
everywhere were whips, crosses, gibbets, funeral piles; and
soldiers, colonists, sailors engaged in slaying, strangling, drowning
human beings, whose only crime was their refusal to go back into
slavery. Some had their bodies lacerated by the scourge; then
they were fastened to posts in the vicinity of a marsh, that they
might be devoured, half alive, by blood-sucking insects. Others
were literally burnt alive, as if they had been martyrs for religion.
Death thus appeared before the negro in its two most terrible
aspects, extreme slowness and extreme rapidity. Others in
greater number perished in the sea or on the scaffold. In the
country, trees loaded with flowers and breathing perfumes,
served as gallows, as if to put in broad contrast the goodness of
God and the vileness of man. Countries created for peace, 
happiness, and joy, were thus desolated by human passions scarcely
less baneful to those who fostered and indulged them than to
those against whom they raged.</p>
            <p>On the countenance of those who were led to death shone an
anticipation of the liberty which they felt was about to grow on
a land watered with the blood of their caste. They had the same
firmness, the same resignation, the same enthusiasm as 
distinguished the martyr of the Christian religion. On the gibbets,
in the flames, in the midst of tortures scarcely was a sigh to be
heard; even the child hardly shed tears. The words “our
country,” “freedom,” breathed quietly from their dying lips. They
often encouraged each other to bear death manfully. A black
chief named Chevalier, hesitated when he saw the instruments of
his punishment. “What!” said his wife, “thou knowest not
how sweet it is to die for liberty!” and without allowing herself
to be touched by the executioner, she took the rope and ended
her days. A mother said to her daughters who were going to
execution, “Be glad, you will not be mothers of slaves.”</p>
            <p>The strength of soul which the blacks showed in their tortures
<pb id="beard257" n="257"/>
was so surprising, that the whites ascribed the cause to some 
peculiarity of organization. It was pretended that the fibres of the
blacks contracted with so much force that the sufferers became 
insensible to pain. Thus, by vain suppositions, an effort was made to
rob the victims of the glory of their death. If the question was
to make them slaves, then they were not men; if the cruellest
punishments were to be inflicted on them, then they did not
suffer. If they were not men, why make them do the work of
men? If they did not suffer, why impose the punishments?
Beasts may do the work which was laid on beings who were not
men; and sufferings not felt, were inefficacious both as punishments 
and examples. But when did tyranny lack a pretext, or
cruelty lack a palliation? In this case, the pretext and the
palliation did but throw the enormity of the injustice into
relief.</p>
            <p>Ordinary expedients were too tame, or too slow, or not 
sufficiently efficacious. History was ransacked for others. Children,
women, and old men were confined in sacks, and thrown into the
sea: it was the punishment of parricides among the Romans. It
was ascertained that three centuries before, in that same country,
Spaniards had employed dogs to run down the innocent savages.
Frenchmen of the nineteenth century rejoiced that they had at
their command a resource so effectual, and I must add, so 
diabolical. Rochambeau, however, sent a vessel to the isle of Cuba
to purchase dogs whose nature, under man's training, made them
fit for the work of hunting human beings. When this ship
appeared at the fort of the Cape, wives of the colonists went to
receive them on the shore, and made the air resound with cries
of joy; they put garlands on their necks, and strewed their path
with flowers. Some degraded themselves so far as to cover those
instruments of their vengeance with kisses. To what extravagances 
does slavery lead! An experiment must be made. In
the courtyard of a convent a sort of amphitheatre was erected,
which was filled with a multitude panting for negro blood. The
victim was bound to a post. The dogs, sharpened by extreme
hunger, were no sooner let loose, than they tore the poor wretch
pieces. The raging animals disputed with each other the 
<pb id="beard258" n="258"/>
palpitating members, and the ground was dyed with human blood
and canine foam. A report spread among the blacks, that at
the last groan of that pitiable creature, the heavens opened, and
received his soul.</p>
            <p>This kind of death, with circumstances more or less frightful,
became common, until cruelty, dispensing with all forms, disdainfully 
cast human beings to the dogs, who were kept in packs
near the city; and when the appetite of the animals, satisfied
with human flesh and gore, refused any longer to destroy, the
sword finished the bloody work: showing that man's passions
surpass in atrocity those of wild beasts. Indeed, language failed
of terms to describe the crimes which the lust of unjust power
perpetrated. New expressions were invented. The drowning
of two or three hundred human beings was called “a good
haul;” death on a gallows was “a step upwards;” to be torn in
pieces by dogs was “to enter the arena.” Some executioners
gained celebrity; the name of Tombarel long continued to make
men shudder. The sea and the rivers were stained with blood.
The numbers of victims was so considerable that the inhabitants
refused to eat fish, lest they should feed on blood of their own
colour.</p>
            <p>Many blacks, of whom some had witnessed these atrocities,
and others, who, in the confusion, had, by swimming or flight,
escaped from the hands of the executioners, went to join the
ranks of the insurgents in different places. Often, under the
shade of a tree, or under the point of a rock, these fugitives
might be seen recounting to their companions the punishment
they had witnessed, or suffered. How great soever the cruelty,
it was exaggerated in their hyperbolical phraseology. The
crowd listened with intense curiosity, silence, and horror; often
the narrators were interrupted by questions respecting the fate
of a child, or a sister, who had died on the gibbet, or had been
tossed into the sea. It these frightful accounts, the auditors
shed tears, but they were tears of vengeance. Some shouted,
“Shall we go down into our tombs without having avenged
them? No! their bones would repulse ours.” Others, by 
gestures and cries, not satisfied with having carried fire and sword
<pb id="beard259" n="259"/>
over the low lands, stirred each other up to deeds of carnage and
devastation. Vengeance of a certain barbaric grandeur burst
forth. In listening to one of these narratives, Paul L'Ouverture,
the brother of Toussaint, learned, that, without any reason, his
wife, who lived at the Cape, in the peace of her own home, had
been drowned. He fell into a madness of revenge which grief
nourished, and which nothing appeased. He captured, near Fort
Dauphin, a shipwrecked vessel, on board of which were thirty
French passengers. He took them, and having led them to one
of the principal entrances to Cape City, he pitilessly immolated
them all to the manes of his innocent wife, taking pains to put
on a post an inscription, which stated that the death of a beloved
partner had extorted from his grief a vengeance worthy of a
proud, loving, and deeply afflicted soul. Truly, indeed, is revenge
blind as well as ruthless. Who can describe, who can dare to
contemplate the evils of slavery? Sixteen of the bravest generals
of Toussaint L'Ouverture, chained by the neck to the rocks of an
uninhabited island, breathed their last miserable sigh after wasting
away during seventeen days. These abominable cruelties are not
wholly without relief. Captains of ships, instead of casting the
innocent victims put into their hands for the purpose into the
sea, supported them at their own expense, and landed them on
some of the neighbouring islands, or on some remote shore of
Saint Domingo. None showed more humanity than Mazard,
who employed as much zeal in saving victims as others did in
destroying them. “I have,” he said, “deceived your tyrants; my
heart is lacerated to see the land and the sea covered with victims;
go into the mountains, rejoin your people, that posterity may
learn that savages dragged to servitude have founded a new
state; but pity men's passions, and leave your revenge to time,
to remorse, to heaven.”</p>
            <p>All the sea-captains did not act with the same elevation of
soul. They did, indeed, save the blacks from death, but their
conduct was dictated by a base avarice; they took them and
sold them as slaves in some neighbouring island. On one of
these occasions, the governor of Porto-Rico made this fine
<pb id="beard260" n="260"/>
reply: “If they are slaves, I will not purchase them; if they
are free men, you have not the right to sell them.”</p>
            <p>Nor was the army without examples of virtue. There were
generals who, indignant at so many cruelties, uttered 
remonstrances, or disobeyed inhuman commands. Allix, who 
commanded at Port-au-Prince, refused ten thousand shot intended
to be fastened to the feet of victims to freedom. This act of
disobedience, which was really a virtue, Rochambeau punished
by banishment. Other officers were punished for similar offences.
Truly did the forcible eloquence of the Africans characterize the
war as “a War of Cannibals.”</p>
            <p>Suddenly the south, which had been tranquil, awoke at the
noise of the punishments which sent from the north and the
west corpses to float on its shores. That province was peopled
chiefly by men of colour, who possessed great wealth, and who
showed themselves less than in other parts, enemies of the whites,
with whom, notwithstanding the force of prejudice, they were
united by marriage. When they saw that they themselves were
not spared any more than the blacks, they ran to arms. The
revolt began in the district of Petit-Troux, where, under the
pretext of a conspiracy, of which nothing has ever become known,
they had drowned Boudet, who had delivered up the fort Bizoton
at the attack of Port-au-Prince. That punishment revolted public
opinion the more because it involved ingratitiude. The revolt 
became general as soon as it had been resolved to put to death in the
city of Cayes inhabitants of colour, who were in the police
service, and who were charged with betraying signs of discontent. 
But how could punishment be inflicted on so many in
silence? Recourse was had to the sea. The men were seized,
disarmed, put into a ship, murdered, and thrown by night into
the waves. But womanly love could not be blinded. Women,
who had heard the voice of the carnage, demanded with tears in
their eyes, that the massacre of their brothers and their husbands
should not go unpunished. Then there appeared on the stage a
new man, named Ferrou. Highly esteemed in peace, he was
terrible in war. He was not a barbarian, his vengeance had
some dignity. After having raised the country, he ordered all
<pb id="beard261" n="261"/>
the colonists to be arrested, and to be conducted safe and sound
to the village Coteaux, situate not far from the sea where his
people had been destroyed. Not expecting clemency, the 
captives disdained supplication, and prepared for death. Ferrou
addressed to them these words full of pride and bitterness:
“Cruel whites, you hesitate not to sacrifice to your hate those
who in this land are your defenders. Of what use is it that we
are allied to you by the sweet and sacred bonds of nature, for
our wives are your mothers and daughters? Not fearing the
crime of parricide, you imbrue your hands in our blood. From
this spot behold that sea in which, during a frightful night,
under the pale light of the stars, you drowned a band of our
people. What was their crime? To love you and to serve you.
The winds and the waves bear back to us their livid bodies.
They are brothers, husbands, companions, faithful friends in
servitude, in war, in freedom. A just resentment commands us
to sacrifice you; but go across that blood-stained sea, and join
your own colour; behold in us enemies but not executioners.”
Ferrou then sent them in a vessel to Cayes, and forthwith made his
arrangements for marching against the city.</p>
            <p>Informed of this revolt, provoked by imprudent attacks,
Laplume precipitately returned from the frontiers of the South,
where he was engaged in checking the ravages of the terrible
Lamour de Rance. Scarcely had he got back when he discovered
the smoke of Ferrou's camp, in the vicinity of Port-au-Prince.
He fell on him, and compelled him to retreat into the rugged
mountains called La Hotte, whose decomposing rocks, breaking 
and bursting under men's feet, throw them into their
abysses. But Ferrou knew the safe ways. Those he chose, and
from them he rushed down to make an irruption into the plains
near the town, Petit Goave. The body of troops employed in
the defence of that city was in part composed of people of colour,
and partly of Frenchmen—the former joined the devastator, the
latter took to flight.</p>
            <p>In order the more effectually to keep his eye on the insurrection 
which now covered three provinces, Rochambeau had fixed
his residence at Port-au-Prince, still drawing after him a great
<pb id="beard262" n="262"/>
number of women, with all the equipage of effeminate luxury.
As soon as he had learned the disastrous news, he sent Nétervood
by sea to recapture the city of Petit Goave. As he did not
doubt of success, he gave his lieutenant a pack of hounds partly
to pursue the insurgents with, and partly to devour the prisoners.
Nétervood hastened on his errand, and made an attack. But
the enemy, setting the city on fire, entrenched themselves in a
fort, whence they dealt death on their assailants. Nétervood
received a mortal wound in the midst of his soldiers, who were
fast perishing, being placed between a burning town and a powerful
stronghold. Flight by sea was the only resource; and the dogs,
in the confusion dispersing abroad, added to the dangers and
disgrace of the defeat. Thus Nétervood, eager for peril and
combat, lost his life in the flower of his youth, in the dishonourable 
cause of slavery.</p>
            <p>Bands of insurgents, inflamed by victory, occupied the long
chains of mountains which run through the southern province.
They formed communications one with another, and at their
convenience and their pleasure rushed down into the plains in
torrents which carried away whatever was before them. 
Dessalines put himself at the head of that great movement. Two
powerful chiefs, Geffrard and Cangé, passed from the north to
the south. They joined Ferrou, and in unison hastened across
the mountains to ravage the fertile lands of Cavaillon, of Saint
Louis, and of Cayes. Then they carried devastation over those
of Jérémie.</p>
            <p>These events threw consternation into the soul of Rochambeau. 
The insurrection threatened to pluck out of his hands
the southern provinces. He had at first sent six hundred men
to Laplume for the defence of Cayes; but that weak supply
proving insufficient, he immediately directed toward Jérémie,
vessels which were bringing from France a reinforcement of two
thousand men. One moiety of these men reached Jérémie,
and without delay prepared to set out for their destination. But
from the peaks of his rocks Ferrou saw them, watched them, and
prepared to cut them to pieces. Scarcely were the French ten
miles from Jérémie, when they fell into an ambuscade. After
<pb id="beared263" n="263"/>
a sanguinary conflict they were routed. A frightful slaughter
ensued. The few that escaped, hurried back to Jérémie, where
they spread the utmost alarm.</p>
            <p>The other moiety who landed at Tiburon, were also taken in
an ambuscade, and cut to pieces, near Coteaux. The few who
escaped took refuge in Cayes, into which six hundred other
soldiers had thrown themselves, who were to have formed a
junction with the two defeated divisions.</p>
            <p>Wherever the insurrection reigned scaffolds were erected.
The cities of Cayes and Jérémie were afflicted with numerous
executions, which drew more closely the bonds between the
blacks and the coloured population, and more and more secured
success to the cause of freedom.</p>
            <p>Laplume, seeing that all was lost, embarked for France, where
he died, without leaving means for the interment of his remains.</p>
            <p>Rochambeau, on the brink of despair, made new efforts to put
a stop to the insurrection. He took special pains to withstand
the ravages of Dessalines, whom in a proclamation he threatened
to flog to death, as the meanest of slaves. Men only laughed
at the folly. Nevertheless, he succeeded in protecting from the
continual incursions of that brute, the plain Cul-de-Sac, and
Mirebalais, which furnished provisions to Port-au-Prince. At
the same time he guaranteed the environs of the Cape from the
frequent attacks of Christophe.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Rochambeau experienced increasing difficulties in
the low state of his exchequer. He sought remedies in stock-jobbing, 
and in exactions of all kinds. He drew on the United States
bills to a very large amount, which his government refused to
honour. He levied large contributions on cities that were half
ruined. He imprisoned opulent persons, who obtained their
liberation only by paying large sums of money; some had even
to give up their property altogether. He attempted to justify
these exactions by pleading the necessities of the public service.
But he alienated the hearts of those who through interest
remained attached to his party, to such a degree, that after
having lost a second army, destroyed thousands of poor victims,
and wasted much money, he fell into the same state of distress,
<pb id="beard264" n="264"/>
misery, and abandonment, as that in which Leclerc was a short
time before his death; with this difference, that under the latter
the south had not been polluted or devastated by insensate
passions and internecine war.</p>
            <p>Rochambeau's efforts to stay the insurrection were utterly
futile. Like a vast conflagration, it extended from the south to
the north. If it went out at one point, it blazed up in another.
Soon the war changed its seat. Masters on land, the Africans
commenced hostilities on the seas, which they carried on the
more advantageously because they were protected by the
English. In light boats, with the aid of the tide and of oars,
they went up and down the rivers, passed from the mountains
into the ocean, and from the ocean into the mountains, spreading
terror wherever they appeared. They attacked ships, massacred
the passengers, and loaded themselves with plunder, which they
carried back into their rocky fastnesses. Woe to the French who
sailed toward those deadly shores. Two vessels, from Havre
and from Nantes, fell into their hands; all on board were
slaughtered. As on land so on water, the insurgents could not
be reached; they hid their boats in forests; dispersed, re-assembled, 
defying alike the soldiers and the ships of war; and,
almost with impunity, pursued at will their destructive career.</p>
            <p>At the sight of an insurrection, which was master both on land
and on the sea, Rochambeau was seized with an alarm that he
in vain endeavoured to conceal. The Consul, who rewarded
success only, was to be feared by a man who was overwhelmed
in failure. Of what use so many victims, so many tortures, so
many gallows, so many drownings, so many raging hounds?
All this serves only to illustrate the strength of the insurrection, 
and the hopelessness of his cause. The moment that the
General-in-chief was no longer in a state to make head against
the rebellion, it began to insult and brave him, even in the cities
which were his last places of refuge. His temper became more
and more disquiet and fierce. The shades of his victims 
appeared to him in his dreams. Now he cried out that he would
make Saint Domingo a vast cemetery, where at least slavery
should bear sway. Now he declared he would re-establish
<pb id="beard265" n="265"/>
liberty, which his cruelties had made only more precious to the
inhabitants. Then, but too late, he grew angry at the artifices
of the women who had him in their toils, and at the colonists
who had misled him by their selfish counsels. Yet did he think
it necessary for the security of his troops to continue the system
of terror.</p>
            <p>A situation so deplorable could no longer be kept concealed
from Bonaparte. Rochambeau sent deputies to Paris, who
reported that the revolt, somewhat calm after the death of
Leclerc, having become active again, had spread from the. north to
the south; that Rochambeau, in order to stop its progress, had
employed the force of arms and the utmost terror; that these
remedies had proved powerless; that the insurrection, animated
by a fanatical spirit of liberty, had broken down every embankment; 
that at the head of the insurrection appeared in the
west Dessalines, Christophe in the north, and in the south
Ferrou; that after having laid waste the interior, the insurgents
ravaged the coasts like pirates; that the colonists were in a
state of extreme affliction, at seeing so great an armament 
overwhelmed with reverses; and that the only means of safety was
another expedition.</p>
            <p>Another expedition was impossible. Already had a bad feeling
arisen between France and England. Soon the latter power
declared war against the former. This rupture gave the finishing
blow to the French cause in Hayti. On land, Rochambeau's
troops were invested by the insurgents. At sea the English were
supreme. Nevertheless, the French general maintained himself in
his post with an intrepidity which would have done honour to a
good cause. The sufferings of the besieged became extreme;
rarely have woes equal to theirs been experienced. Rochambeau
has related how pitiable was the existence of himself and 
comrades during this period, when placed between death and life;
they appeased their hunger as well as they could by eating their
horses, mules, asses, and even their dogs: yes, the very hounds
they had obtained, in order to run down their foes.</p>
            <p>Things remained in this condition until the middle of 
November (1803); then the besiegers forced some of the exterior
266
works, and prepared for a new attack. The inflexibility of the
French commander was at length obliged to give way. Well
did he know that an assault, if made, must succeed, and he feared
to fall into the hands of his furious assailants. He offered to
capitulate. The offer was accepted. On the 19th of November
the articles were signed. The treaty stipulated that the French
should evacuate Cap Français at the end of ten days, with all
their artillery, ammunition, and magazines; that they should
withdraw to their vessels with the honours of war and the
guarantee of their private property; that they should leave their
sick and wounded in the hospitals, whom the blacks should take
care of until they were well, and that then they should be sent
to France in neutral vessels. These conditions were more
favourable than the invading army had a right to expect. The
day on which this convention was signed, the French general
sent two officers to treat with the commander of the English
squadron for the evacuation of the Cape. The offered conditions
were rejected. Others were proposed, which Rochambeau found
inadmissible. His refusal had for its ground the hope that the
season would soon compel the English to retire from the vicinity
of the Cape, and so render his escape possible. Vain expectation.
On the 30th of November the standard of the blacks waved
over the Cape. Rochambeau felt compelled to throw himself
on the mercy of the English. At the moment when the ships
in which he had taken refuge were about to be sunk by red-hot
balls prepared by the negroes, the ægis of Britain was thrown
before them, and a frightful massacre was prevented. A short
agreement having been hastily drawn up, Dessalines was
informed that the vessels had surrendered to the arms of his
Britannic Majesty. Not without difficulty did the vengeful and
ferocious Dessalines consent to allow his prey to be thus plucked
out of his hands. Shortly, a favourable breeze having sprang
up, the three frigates and seventeen small craft that formed the
French fleet at the Cape, set sail, according to the convention,
under the French flag; then having tacked, they struck their
colours and surrendered. The prisoners of war amounted to
eight thousand.</p>
            <pb id="beard267" n="267"/>
            <p>Saint Marc, Cayes, Jérémie, Saint Nicholas, the Spanish territory, 
were successively abandoned by the French. The departure
of the troops in the different cities was a painful scene. Families
of the colonists and many other persons lacked vessels to fly
from the fury of the irritated blacks. Wives and children were
separated from their husbands and their fathers. The shores 
resounded with cries and lamentations. On land these were about
to fall into the hands of persons who had been their slaves; on sea
those were about to become prisoners to the English. A number
entrusted their lives and their fortunes to fragile barks.</p>
            <p>As they sailed from the island, Rochambeau, the soldiers, and
the colonists saw the tops of the mountains glow with fire. 
Aforetime the blaze had been kindled for war and devastation; now
the blacks lighted up their high lands in token of their joy.
Freedom had been wrested out of the hands of their foes. Every
heart beat with the thought. The dark past was wholly gone:
the future was radiant with hope. “Freedom! freedom!” ran
in joyous echoes from mountain-top to mountain-top, till the
whole island shouted “Freedom!”</p>
            <p>Thus ended this deplorable expedition. In less than two years
sixty thousand persons fell: fifteen hundred were officers of superior 
rank; eight hundred were medical men; three and thirty
thousand were soldiers, of whom not a sixth perished in battle.
The attempt at subjugation cost the blacks more than twelve
thousand men, of whom about four thousand found death at
the hands of executioners of various kinds.</p>

            <p>Toussaint L'Ouverture carried with him into his dungeon the
conviction that he was to undergo a trial. In this conviction he
sustained his soul. He felt confident of a triumph. His enemies
he knew were numerous and powerful. The Consul, he 
suspected, feared as much as hated him. Yet what was his
crime? Had not his authority emanated from the supreme
power in France? By that power his position and his acts had
been sanctioned. And if even he had offered resistance to the
expedition, that opposition had been covered by an act of
indemnity proclaimed by Leclerc. If solemn asseverations meant
anything, if reiterated oaths retained their validity, he could
stand before any tribunal in full confidence of an honourable
acquittal.</p>
            <p>But the First Consul was far from intending to give his prisoner
the advantages of a trial. A trial was a public appeal to the
great principles of law and right. In such an issue Bonaparte
knew very well who would be the loser. There was another,
and, for his purpose, a safer way. Toussaint was advanced in
years. He had been accustomed to active pursuits. He was an
African, and had lived only in tropical regions. His days, 
therefore, could be only few, and their number would be much
abridged by confinement in a foul prison, under a chilling
climate. Could he hold out through the coming winter? If he
survived too long—why, other prisoners had passed away
secretly; power has its secret strings and its swift remedies.</p>
            <p>By a series of cunningly devised and coolly executed measures,
<pb id="beard269" n="269"/>
Toussaint L'Ouverture was, ere many months, brought to his
grave.</p>
            <p>All communication with the outer world was forbidden him.
He received no news of his wife and family. He passed his
days alone with his servant; the presence of that faithful domestic
was a support to him. That solace was taken away, and 
Toussaint was left alone. Yet was he not alone, for God was with
him. In prayer his soul rose hourly to his Maker, and he received
constantly new effusions of comfort and strength. Religious
thoughts and observances carried his mind back to the country
for which he had sacrificed everything. There, in imagination,
he again saw the chapel where he and his family were wont to
worship, and while the hymns of praise went up from its 
neatly-formed roof, he was drawn into sympathy with the worshippers,
and with a moved heart and liquid voice, he joined his 
thanksgivings with theirs. Day by day, and often hours together, was
he on his knees, seeking aid and finding support at the footstool
of the heavenly grace, where never mortal knelt in vain.</p>
            <p>But time passed on, and there were no signs of the expected
trial. Hope sustained against hope began at last to fail. What!
was he then a prisoner for life? If so, his sufferings, if severe,
would not be long. Already he felt the chills of the nights of
autumn—there alone, in that cold, dreary dungeon, no fire, little
clothes, no companion, those long pinching nights. And then
the winds bean to blow hollow and loud, as if they announced a
worse time coming. How soon? How long? The winter must
be at hand; his captivity may extend through its whole course;
but can it endure, can life stretch out, till the genial breath of
spring return?</p>
            <p>One day, in the midst of Toussaint's gloomy solitude, a visitor
was announced. A visitor! what, if it were his son Isaac! or if
not he, perhaps an officer of justice to announce the coming
trial, No, it was Cafarelli, aide-de-camp to the First Consul. “O
then, here is an order for liberation; the prison doors will fly
open, and I shall once more see my wife and children!” Alas,
poor heart, no! the man comes from one whose soul is meaner
than his own. Bonaparte thinks it a pity the treasures he
<pb id="beard270" n="270"/>
fancies you have buried should be lost; and though he does not
intend to give you your freedom as the price of the disclosure,
yet he sends his aide-de-camp to trick you into some kind of
confession on the point, which he may turn to account, and in
the result of which, if it is enough, he may find some compensation 
for the millions he has lavished in Saint Domingo in
making you his captive.</p>
            <p>Toussaint, great in misfortune, gave for his reply, “I have
lost something very different from money.” Yes, thou hadst
lost the liberty thou didst once enjoy; and, peradventure, in a
moment of sorrow thou thoughtest thou hadst lost the sacred
cause in which thou hadst put thy soul.</p>
            <p>But mark this Consul's mean spirit. He had his victim there
cooped up only too safely in that humid and infected prison.
Still he was unsatisfied. Possibly the prisoner had money. If
so, why its hiding-place must be ascertained, ere his lips are
sealed in the silence of death. “Go then, Cafarelli, get the
secret out of the old negro, and then he may be allowed to die.”</p>
            <p>Toussaint would not resign himself to his fate without an
effort. There was only one tribunal, and that tribunal was a
perjured one. Yet an appeal might have some effect. The
following letter was therefore written:—</p>

is contrary to my intentions; if I was wrong in forming the

through having employed too much zeal, too much self-love,
thinking I was pleasing the government under which I was;
if the formalities which I ought to have observed were neglected,
it was through inattention. I have had the misfortune to incur
your wrath, but as to fidelity and probity, I am strong in my

frankness, have forced me to open my heart to him.</p>

            <p>Days passed away, and no notice was taken of this epistle.
The report of which it speaks was either suppressed or
neglected. Dead to pity, Bonaparte watched for the 
consummation of the villany he had designed. It was customary
to allow the commander of the prison five francs (about four
shillings) a day for the subsistence of each prisoner; the First
Consul wrote that three were sufficient for a revolter. More
than sufficient for thy base purpose! Didst thou remember
those words when thou didst beat thyself against the bars of
thy own cage in the island of St. Helena, complaining daily
of a table which, compared with thy allowance to “the first of
the blacks,” was a banquet of delicacies to “a dinner of herbs!”</p>
            <p>While the process of gradual starvation was going forward,
its unconscious victim, outraged by his sufferings, wrote this

humanity, to cast a favourable eye on my appeal, on my position,
and my family; direct your great genius to my conduct, to the
manner in which I have served my country, to all the dangers
I have run in discharging my duty. I have served my country
with fidelity and probity; I have served it with zeal and courage;
I have been devoted to the Government under which I was; I
<pb id="beard272" n="272"/>
have sacrificed my blood, and a part of what I possessed, to serve
my country, and in spite of my efforts, all my labours have been
in vain. You will permit me, First Consul, to say to you, with
all the respect and submission which I owe you, that the Government 
has been completely deceived in regard to Toussaint 
L'Ouverture, in regard to one of its most zealous and courageous
servants in Saint Domingo. I laboured long to acquire honour
and glory from the Government, and to gain the esteem of my
fellow-citizens, and I am now, for my reward, crowned with
thorns and the most marked ingratitude. I do not deny the
faults I may have committed, and for which I beg your pardon.
But those faults do not deserve the fourth of the punishment I
have received, nor the treatment I have undergone.</p>
                    <p>“First Consul, it is a misfortune for me that I am not known

very strong in my conscience in that matter; and if I had not

services. All my life I have been in active service, and since
the revolution of the 10th of August, 1790, 1 have constantly
been in the service of my country. Now I am a prisoner, with
no power to do anything; sunk in grief, my health is impaired.</p>

            <p>Alas! the First Consul has pronounced judgment, and the
<pb id="beard273" n="273"/>
consequent sentence the prisoner is even now undergoing. That
sentence is “slow death!” And then as you, Toussaint, shake
with the cold of the northern blast, or sink overcome with sorrow
on the moist, foul floor of your cell, or refuse with loathing the
unsavoury food; and as your limbs part with their strength, and
your heart flutters in debility, and your blood becomes thin and
poor, and as you look to the winter's frost, snow, hail, and storm,
with a vague distress and dismal forebodings—in each step of
the process of slow death the Consul's verdict goes into execution, 
and another day, or another week, is taken from the brief
number that remain to you.</p>
            <p>Yet well and noble is it, that under the depression of your
unhappy condition, while your heart sinks with the sinking of

supplications, and that, retaining your own high manly spirit, you
protest your innocence, proclaim your services, and charge your
enemies with ingratitude.</p>
            <p>Toussaint L'Ouverture then began to compose with his own
hand a document, in which he entered into a systematic defence
of his conduct. This document, the orthography of which is
said to have been defective, was couched in correct and 
sometimes eloquent terms. By permission of the governor of the
castle, it was copied by Martial-Besse, then one of his prisoners,
and on the 2nd of October it was transmitted to the First Consul. 
The document contained the following passages:—“General
Leclerc employed towards me means which have never been
employed towards the greatest enemies. Doubtless, I owe that
contempt to my colour; but has that colour prevented me
from serving my country with zeal and fidelity? Does the
colour of my body injure my honour or my courage? Suppose
I was criminal, and that the General-in-Chief had orders to
arrest me,—was it needful to employ a hundred carbineers to
arrest my wife and children, to tear them from their residence
without respect, and without regard for their rank, their sex;
without humanity, and without charity? Was it necessary to
fire on my plantations, and on my family, to ransack and 
<pb id="beard274" n="274"/>
pillage my property! No! My wife, my children, my household,
were under no responsibility,—have no account to render to
Government; General Leclerc had not even the right to arrest
them. Was that officer afraid of a rival? I compare him to
the Roman Senate, that pursued Hannibal even into his retirement. 
I request that he and I may appear before a tribunal,
and that the Government bring forward the whole of my 
correspondence with him. By that means, my innocence, and all
I have done for the Republic, will be seen.</p>
            <p>“First Consul, father of all French soldiers, upright judge,
defender of the innocent, pronounce a decision as to my destiny:
my wound is deep, apply a remedy to it: you are the physician,
I rely entirely on your wisdom and skill.”</p>
            <p>These appeals to the justice, honour, and humanity of the
First Consul proved abortive. Bonaparte's mind was made up.
His ear, therefore, was closed. Toussaint spoke to a foregone
conclusion; his words were encountered by a fixed determination. 
That determination was so fixed, and so well known,
that no one dared to speak in favour of the oppressed and doomed
hero. Fear of the supreme magistrate occupied all minds around
him, and gave to his will the force of law.</p>
            <p>That precipitate and iron mind found the process of slow
murder too slow. Solitude, cold, and short fare, were tardy in
their operation. Their natural tardiness was not abated by the
presence with the captive of his faithful servant. Mars Plaisir
was therefore taken away by an express order of the Government.
In parting from him, Toussaint L'Ouverture said, “Carry my
last farewell to my wife, my children, and my niece. Would I
could console thee under this cruel separation: be assured of my
friendship and of the remembrance which I shall always preserve
of thy services and of thy devotedness.”</p>
            <p>Toussaint, thou art still the same, still self-forgetful, still
mindful of thy wife and family. The disinterested benevolence
which made thee a patriot, and which the prospect of supreme
power could not bribe into subjection, remains unchilled by the
cold of the Jura mountains, and unsuppressed by bodily weakness,
and unperverted by ingratitude and perfidy.</p>
            <pb id="beard275" n="275"/>
            <p>Mars Plaisir was loaded with chains and sent to Nantes, where
he was put in prison. But unwelcome truths make their way
through bars and walls, therefore was the good servant specially
guarded and watched, lest, before his master's demise, he should
disclose facts that might prove troublesome, or set in motion
instruments that might traverse the designs of the tyrant.</p>
            <p>The progress made in Hayti by the assertors of the national
independence, kept Bonaparte in a constant state of solicitude.
He could not conceal from himself that the escape of Toussaint
from his dungeon was a possible event. He was well aware that
his reappearance in Saint Domingo would make the reduction
of the inhabitants impossible. Nay, the mere knowledge of his
being still alive, while it encouraged the hope of his yet taking
the lead of the soldiers of independence, served to keep up the
courage of the insurgents, and to augment the difficulties of
Rochambeau. His death, therefore, seemed to Bonaparte
urgently necessary. Affairs were hurrying to a crisis in the
West Indies. A blow must be struck. The trunk of the 
insurrection, the First Consul had it in his power to pluck up and
destroy: at least, so he thought. Therefore the order went forth,
“Cut it down: root it up.” The manner was worthy of the
deed.</p>
            <p>The governor of the castle was chosen for the perpetration of
the crime. Scarcely was he a man for the work. He had
scruples of conscience. But nothing short of plenary obedience
would be accepted. Besides, it was not a question of the dagger
or the bowl. All that was wanted was a more decided system
of privation. And that system he scarcely needed to work
actively. When a prisoner is kept in close confinement, and
must be got rid of, you have only to reduce his means of 
subsistence until death ensues as a matter of course. And if the
process is too slow, it may be accelerated by a little well-timed
neglect. To an attenuated and famished frame, the want of
nutrition for a few days brings certain death. Let the ordinary
pittance of supply then be forgotten, and your end is gained.
And who shall dare to call an act of oblivion by the foul and
offensive name of murder?</p>
            <pb id="beard276" n="276"/>
            <p>The governor twice took a journey to Neufchâtel, in Switzerland. 
The first time he entrusted the keys of Toussaint's cell
to Captain Colomier, whom he appointed to fill his place in his
absence. Colomier visited the noble prisoner, who spoke to him
modestly of his own glory, but with indignation of the design
imputed to him of having wished to deliver Saint Domingo up
to the English. His emaciated and feeble hands were engaged
in writing a paper intended to disprove that groundless charge.
The officer found Toussaint in a state of almost absolute privation. 
A little meal was his only food, and that he had to prepare 
himself in a small earthen jug. But Colomier had a heart:
he pitied the destitution of a man who had had at his command the
opulence of Saint Domingo. His humanity made him unfit for
his office, and ascertaining that the captive accounted the want
of coffee among his chief privations, he ventured at his own risk
to furnish a small supply.</p>
            <p>When the governor returned, he found that Toussaint
L'Ouverture was still alive. In a short time he took a second
journey to the same town, and for the same purpose; and as he
suspected that Colomier's good nature had interfered with his
duty, he said to him, on leaving, with a disquieted countenance,
“I entrust to you the guardianship of the castle; but this time
I do not give you the keys of the dungeons: the prisoners have
no need of anything.”</p>
            <p>The governor returned on the fourth day. Toussaint was no more.
He ascertained the fact. Yes, there he is—dead; no doubt 
whatever—dead and cold. He has died of inanition. And see, if you
have courage to look on so horrible a sight—the rats have
gnawed his feet!</p>
            <p>The work is done—the crime is perpetrated. Bonaparte's will
<hi rend="italics">is</hi> law: his word is death. But murder is a word of evil
sound. The world, with all its depravity, has a moral feeling,
and that moral feeling it is impolitic to outrage. A veil must
be thrown over the assassination.</p>
            <p>“Toussaint is dead;”—“how came he by his death?”</p>
            <p>The governor, on learning that his captive had breathed his
last, carried some provisions into his dungeon. Who now can
<pb id="beard277" n="277"/>
say that Toussaint had been starved to death? He died in the
midst of abundance. This was the governor's own plea. But
he deprived that plea of its effect by his eagerness to obtrude
and make the most of it; and he betrayed his guilt by his
looks and manner. Yes, he was distressed at Toussaint's sudden
departure,—he bewailed the event. But hypocrisy ever overacts 
its part. Besides, the governor was not thoroughly 
depraved; and that which he would have men regard as the 
sadness of a virtuous heart in mourning, they saw to be the ragings
of a conscience smitten with a sense of guilt; his checks put on
a livid paleness; his steps were hasty and uncertain; his eyes
were wild. Yes, here is a man deeply suffering under the stings
of remorse. His nervous and agitated efforts to make it clear
—very clear, beyond a question—that Toussaint has died of a
natural cause, demonstrates that he knows more than he dares
reveal, and has contracted a guilt that he would fain conceal
even from his own eyes. But the keys of the dungeon were in
his possession; and the words, “The prisoners want nothing,”
and the food recently carried thither; these facts—known to our
authority,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref18" n="18" rend="sc" target="note18">*</ref>
<note id="note18" n="18" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref18">* See particularly Métral's <foreign lang="fre">“Histoire de l'Expédition des Français à Saint
Domingue,”</foreign> p. 201, seq.</note> and known to Captain Colomier, and known to other
inmates of the castle—declare that murder has been committed.
Yes, now we see why Mars Plaisir has been sent away. And
now we see why this remote, solitary, wild and freezing prison
has been chosen. And now we see why Toussaint L'Ouverture
was entrapped. The series of crimes is consummated.</p>
            <p>Still the question returns, “What will be the opinion of the
world?” Medical men were called in. The head was opened;
the brain was scrutinized. “It is apoplexy,” the authorities
said; and apoplexy was set down in the formal report made as
to the cause of Toussaint's death. Possibly so; but what 
produced the apoplexy? Ask Captain Colomier—ask the mayor of
the district. They were both required to state that death had
taken place by some cause different from hunger, and they both
refused!</p>
            <pb id="beard278" n="278"/>
            <p>Yes; what was the opinion of the world? The world believed
and declared that there had been foul play. That belief gained
prevalence in Saint Domingo, and added fuel to the flames of
wrath which, without this new brand, burned with intensest
fierceness, consuming the French army, and making their longer
stay in the island an impossibility.</p>
            <p>Thus, in the beginning of April, in the year 1803, died 
Toussaint L'Ouverture. A grandson of an African king, he passed
the greater number of his days in slavery, and rose to be a
soldier, a general, a governor. He possessed a rare genius, the
efficiency of which was augmented by an unusual power of 
self-concealment. His life lay in thought and in action rather than
in words. Self-contained, he was also self-sufficing. Though he
disdained not the advice of others, he was in the main his own
council-board. With an intense concentration of vitality in his
own soul, he threw into his outer life a power and an energy
which armed one man with the power of thousands, and made
him great alike in the command of others and in the command
of himself. He was created for government by the hand of
Nature. That strength of soul and self-reliance which made him
fit to rule, also gave him subjects for his sway. Hence it was
that he could not remain in the herd of his fellow slaves. Rise
he must, and rise he did; first to humble offices, then to the
command of a regiment, and then to the command of “the
armies of Saint Domingo.”</p>
            <p>To the qualities which make an illustrious general and statesman, 
there were added in Toussaint's soul, the milder virtues
that form the strength and the ornament of domestic life.
Great as he was in the field and in the cabinet, scarcely less
great and more estimable was he as a husband and a father.
There his excellences shone without a shade. The sacrifice of
his sons to the duty which he owed to his country, only 
illustrates the intensity of a patriotism which could extort so
precious a possession from a father's hands.</p>
            <p>But he had learned his duty from the lips of One who taught
men to make the love of children and parents subordinate to
the love of himself; and assured that he had in some special
<pb id="beard279" n="279"/>
manner been called and sent to set the captive free, he, in a
native benevolence of character which the Gospel enriched,
strengthened, and directed, concentrated all the fine endowments
of his soul on the great work of negro emancipation in the
island of his birth.</p>
            <p>His mind appeared in his countenance and his manner, yet
only as if under a veil. His looks were noble and dignified,
rather than refined;<ref targOrder="U" id="ref19" n="19" rend="sc" target="note19">*</ref>
<note id="note19" n="19" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref19">* All the likenesses of Toussaint L'Ouverture which I have seen except
one, have the disadvantage of being in profile.</note> his eyes, darting fire, told of the burning
elements of his soul. Though little aided by what is called
education, he, in the potency of his mind, bent and moulded
language to his thoughts, and ruled the minds of others by an
eloquence which was no less concise than simple, manly, and
full of imagery. As with other men of ardent genius, he fused
ideas into proverbs, and put into circulation sayings that are
reported to be still current in his native land.</p>
            <p>But after all, he was greater in deed than he was in word.
Vast was the influence which he acquired by the mere force of
his silent example. His very name became a tower of strength
to his friends and a terror to his foes. Hence his presence was
so impressive, that none approached him without fear, nor left
him without emotion.</p>
            <p>If the world has reason to thank God for great men, with
special gratitude should we acknowledge the divine goodness in
raising up Toussaint L'Ouverture. Among the privileged races
of the earth, the roll of patriots, legislators, and heroes, is long
and well filled. As yet there is but one Toussaint L'Ouverture.
Yet how many of the highest qualities of our nature did that
one unite in himself. But his best claim to our respect and
admiration, consists in the entire devotion of his varied and
lofty powers to the redemption of his colour from degrading
bondage, and its elevation into the full stature of perfect
manhood.</p>
            <p>I do not intend to paint the Haytian patriot as a perfect man.
Moral perfection once appeared on earth. It is not likely to
<pb id="beard280" n="280"/>
have appeared a second time among the slaves of Hayti. 
Toussaint has been accused of harshness and cruelty. I am not 
prepared to affirm that the charges are without foundation. But
it is equally true that his enemies have done their utmost to
point out stains in his character. Unfortunately, the means for
a thorough investigation are wholly wanting. It has also been
said that he was an adept at dissimulation. But secrecy in his
circumstances was both needful and virtuous; and if the study
of secrecy on his part was undue, let the failing be set down
against him at its full value. It has even been intimated that
when in power he yielded to the fascinations of the accomplished
creole women of the Cape. But the intimation, faint and 
indirect as it is, rests on no solid grounds. In truth, it was
impossible that a man of the origin and aims of Toussaint
L'Ouverture should have escaped the shafts of calumny, and,
after all due abatements are made, enough of excellence remains
to command our admiration and win our esteem.</p>
            <p>While, however, the world has seen but one Toussaint
L'Ouverture, this history sets forth many black men who were
possessed of great faculties, and accomplished great deeds.
And though the instance of their chief only shows what an
elevation men with a black skin may possibly attain, there are
in the general tenour of this narrative proofs very numerous
and irrefragable, that in the ordinary powers and virtues which
form the texture and the ornament of civilized life, an African
origin and negro blood involve no essential disqualification.</p>
            <p>Very clear, certainly, has it appeared that whether in its rights,
its wrongs, its penalties, or its rewards, Justice—the ever-living
daughter of the eternal God, and the ever-present and ever-active
administratrix of Divine Providence—knows nothing whatever of
the distinctions, the prejudices, the dislikes, or the preferences
of colour. An injury done to a European ceases not to be an
injury when the sufferer is an African. Nor are breakers of
God's laws punished with less severity within the tropics than
they are in the temperate zones. Slavery, which is the essence
and the concentration of injustice—Slavery, which from its
foundation to its top-stone is one huge and frightful accumulation
<pb id="beard281" n="281"/>
of wrong of wrongs the hugest and the direst—Slavery,
which is the worst form of treachery to man and treason against
God, entails vengeance the most terrible, the most awful; 
vengeance not less sure than dreadful. Alas! that in the scourge
the innocent should suffer as well as the guilty. The thought
would sink the mind in grief, were it not attended by the 
conviction that “the hour cometh” when the righteous shall shine
as stars in the firmament for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>The family of Toussaint L'Ouverture received the news of
his death with the deepest grief. They wept and wailed, and
refused to be comforted because he was not.</p>
            <p>Under a pretence that they contemplated escape, those 
innocent persons were transferred from Bayonne to Agen, where
they found friends worthy of themselves.</p>
            <p>When Saint Jean L'Ouverture heard of his father's death, he
declared that he should not long survive him. The saying was
too true. The effects of the climate on a naturally weak 
constitution brought him to the tomb ere he had quitted the
period of youth. His death almost caused the death of his
female cousin, from whom he received in his sickness the most
tender and vigilant cares.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, the family succeeded in obtaining the favour
that Placide L'Ouverture should quit his place of detention and
reside with them at Agen.</p>
            <p>Madame Toussaint L'Ouverture, who was beloved and revered
alike by her husband and her children, survived that husband
and her youngest son for several years, without being able to
overcome the grief which their loss occasioned, and which was
so deep and constant as to undermine her faculties. She died,
in 1816, in the arms of her sons, Placide and Isaac L'Ouverture.</p>
            <p>The history of L'Ouverture placed by the side of the history
of Bonaparte, presents a number of striking parallels. Both
born in a humble position, they raised themselves to the height
of power by the force of their genius and the intense energy of
their character. Both gained renown in legislation and government 
as well as in war. Both fell the moment they had
<pb id="beard282" n="282"/>
attained supreme authority. Both were betrayed by pretended
friends, and delivered into the hands of embittered foes. Both
were severed from their families. Both finished their lives
on a barren rock.</p>
            <p>The parallels have their contrasts. Toussaint L'Ouverture
fought for liberty; Bonaparte fought for himself. Toussaint
L'Ouverture gained fame and power, by leading an oppressed
and injured race to the successful vindication of their rights;
Bonaparte made himself a name and acquired a sceptre by
supplanting liberty and destroying nationalities, in order to
substitute his own illegitimate despotism. The fall of Toussaint
L'Ouverture was a voluntary retirement from power, accompanied 
by a voluntary renunciation of authority, under circumstances 
which seemed to guarantee that freedom the attainment
of which had been the sole object of his efforts; the fall of
Bonaparte was the forced abdication of a throne which was
regarded as a European nuisance, and descent from which was
a virtual acknowledgment that he had utterly failed in the
purposes of his life. In the treachery which they underwent,
on one side, Toussaint L'Ouverture was the victim and 
Bonaparte the seducer; and on the other side, the former suffered
from those who had been his enemies, the latter from those who
in profession were his constant friends. And in the rupture
of their domestic ties, Bonaparte was the injurer, Toussaint
L'Ouverture the injured.</p>
            <p>Nor is it easy to bring one's mind to the conclusion, that
retribution was wholly absent in the facts to which allusion has
just been made. The punishment is too like the crime to be
regarded as accidental. Toussaint's domestic bereavement was
requited by Bonaparte's domestic sorrows. The drear solitude
of the castle of Joux was experienced over again at Saint
Helena by him who inflicted the penalty. Strange to say, it
was a friend of the negroes—namely, Admiral Maitland—that
conducted the Corsican to his prison. And as if to make the
correspondence the more complete, and the retribution the more
potent, by an exchange of extreme localities, the man of the
temperate regions was transferred to the tropics, to atone for his
<pb id="beard283" n="283"/>
crime in transferring the man of the tropics to the killing frosts
of the temperate regions. Resembling each other in several
points of their calamities and pains, the two differed in that
which is the dividing line between the happy and the wretched;
for while, with Bonaparte, God was a name, with Toussaint 
L'Ouverture, God was at once the sole reality and the sovereign
good.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref20" n="20" rend="sc" target="note20">*</ref></p>

            </argument>
            <p>THE retirement of the French forces from the island of Saint
Domingo, shortly after the death of Toussaint L'Ouverture,
assured the natives of the essential goodness of their cause, and
the genuine vigour of their strength. Aforetime, they had been
making experiments; now, success gave them a consciousness of
superiority. Even when robbed of their national hero, they had
destroyed their foe and achieved their independence. From that
moment, the blacks, who formed the bulk of the inhabitants,
believed themselves invincible. Whatever Europeans were in
Europe, in Saint Domingo they were clearly inferior to Africans.
There had been a great trial of strength, and white tyranny,
having been worsted in the encounter, must submit to its own
law—the law of the stronger. In their hyperbolical language
the blacks asked, “What fleet, what army, what warriors can in
future bring us slavery? At their approach, should we not
behold the form of a giant, the angry genius of our native land,
raise the tempests with his powerful hand, and break in pieces
and scatter their ships? The laws of nature obey his puissant
voice; the plague, conflagration, prison, and famine, follow in
his footsteps; but without the aid of this genius, whose arms are
the elements, have we not souls hardened in adversity, and now
<pb id="beard285" n="285"/>
more than ever panting for combat, for peril, for glory. The
empire of our liberty can only grow, rise, and become grand.”</p>
            <p>But when they cast their eyes around them, they fall into
melancholy, and waste away in regrets. Here is one who bewails
the loss of a beloved wife that perished on the scaffold; there,
another who cannot put away from his heart the image of a
sister whom he saw thrown into the flames. Mothers weep for
their infants crushed in their cradles. This man points out the
tree which served as a gibbet for his father; another indicates
the spot which is still stained with the gore of relatives, torn in
pieces by half-starved hounds. One cries, “There is the sea,
where I saw a whole band of our brothers perish.” His 
companion attempts to calculate the victims, and makes their number
amount to more than twenty thousand. On all sides, they see
the perishing limbs or the dry bones of those with whom they
own a community of nature: horrible images, which nourish in
their souls a vengeance that, whether silent or clamorous, is alike
fearful.</p>
            <p>But if the past afflicts them, they are consoled by the future.
Are they not about to offer to the world the singular spectacle of
savages torn from the deserts of Africa, forming a new and 
well-organized state, which will dictate laws, promote civilizaton,
receive ambassadors, form treaties, and make its flag respected
by nations both near and remote? Thus, out of the bosom of
Slavery would there arise a people, free, independent, and happy.
Their origin, their adversity, their elevation, were unexampled in
history. They had before them a great destiny. Besides, in their
emancipation there was a guarantee of the emancipation of their
race. Hayti free, the West Indies would not long remain in
bondage; and when once the islands sang aloud in the joy of
liberty, the Continent, at no very distant day, would send back
the sounds in reverberations increased a hundredfold.</p>
            <p>The colonists too, again, contemplated their condition; they
were ruined, yet would they not relinquish hope. They were in
exile, but they would not forego their desire to return. What!
should slaves rule a land which their own ancestors had fertilized
and civilized? Should slaves reap the harvests of wealth which
<pb id="beard286" n="286"/>
they themselves had once enjoyed, and which of right belonged
to them? Could France be insensible to the treasures of that
mine whence it had already drawn so much wealth? Will not
the Consul put forth his mighty hand, and resume possessions
which are sufficient to enrich him? And surely they themselves
had claims on his considerations. “See,” they exclaimed—“see
Saint Domingo a second time watered with our blood—with our
blood, shed by the hands of slaves—the hands of our own slaves;
our cities, our plantations, our edifices, are only heaps of ruins;
and we ourselves, once the wealthiest of men, are houseless
wanderers, condemned to live on charity.” With Bonaparte, to be
weak was to be in the wrong, and complaints were a kind of
personal offence; the colonists had lost the game, and consequently
were unworthy of attention: he listened to them no longer.</p>
            <p>Saint Domingo, however, after having been the theatre of so
many tragic scenes, was scarcely more than a desert inhabited by
hordes of blacks, simple, ignorant, semi-barbarous, who knew the
extremes of slavery and freedom; they had learnt much, because
they had suffered much; they still preserved the youthful vigour
of nature; but they had a task before them of the utmost difficulty, 
in comparison with which their strength was weakness
indeed. Yet had they grounds of confidence. Among those
grounds, their liberty was the chief; a liberty not bestowed, but
acquired; a liberty fought for and paid for; a liberty, therefore,
replete no less with strength than instruction. That liberty they
owed to Toussaint L'Ouverture, who thus appeared to them as
the founder of the state as well as the vindicator of their liberties.
While fighting for the national freedom, and laying the foundations 
of the new policy, Toussaint had begun to form the men of
his colour to the arts of peace, and to prepare them for developing
the advantages which he put into their hands. Beneficial results
would be slow to come, yet come they would. Under the fostering 
wings of liberty, and under the impulses of the undying
mind and example of the national hero and patriot, letters and
the arts, commerce and opulence, civilization and religion, would
revive, and grow, and in time flourish.</p>
            <p>After the departure of Rochambeau and the forces under his
<pb id="beard287" n="287"/>
command, there remained in the island a number of Frenchmen,
at Cape François and other towns. In part, their continued
residence in Saint Domingo arose from their inability to find
accommodation in the vessels which received their retiring 
fellow-countrymen. Some were not in haste to remove, hoping that
they might by delay dispose of their property to a less disadvantage 
than was possible in the hurry of a compulsory and immediate
departure. Others, again, were detained by a regard to domestic
alliances into which they had entered.</p>
            <p>It appears somewhat strange that any who had witnessed the
tragic scenes of the recent terrible struggle, and who knew how
the sensitive nature of the blacks made them prone to sudden
and violent outbursts of vengeance, should have dared to risk
their lives by tarrying on the scene of conflict. Few in number,
and without organization, they were exposed to all the chances
of reprisals, which lay in the sense of accumulated injuries and
the consciousness of overwhelming numbers. At first, the 
political horizon was calm, and inspired them with some degree of
hope or even confidence; but the promise of safety soon vanished.
A proclamation, however, was put forth which was of favourable
augury; it ran thus:</p>
            <q type="letter" direct="unspecified">
              <text>
                <body>
                  <div1 type="letter">
                    <opener>“IN THE NAME OF THE BLACKS, AND THE MEN OF COLOUR:</opener>
                    <p>“The independence of Saint Domingo is proclaimed. 
Restored to our primitive dignity, we have secured our rights; we
swear never to cede them to any power in the world. The
frightful veil of prejudice is torn in pieces; let it remain so for
ever. Woe to him who may wish to collect the blood-stained
tatters.</p>
                    <p>You, proprietors of Saint Domingo, who are wandering in
foreign countries, while we proclaim our independence, we in 
no-way forbid you, whosoever you are, to return to your properties.
Far from us be such an idea! We are not ignorant that many
among you have renounced their old errors, abjured the 
injustice of their exorbitant pretensions, and recognised the justice
of the cause for which, during twelve years, we have shed our
<pb id="beard288" n="288"/>
blood. We will treat as brethren the men who do us this justice;
let them for ever reckon on our esteem and our friendship; let
them return and dwell amongst us! May the God who protects
us, the God of free men, prevent us from turning against them
our triumphant arms. As to those who, possessed by senseless
pride, interested slaves of guilty pretension, are blind enough to
think themselves the essence of human nature, and declare that
heaven made them to be our masters and our tyrants—let them
never approach the land of Saint Domingo; if they come hither,
they will find chains and banishment. Let them remain where
they are; and tormented by a too well-merited wretchedness,
and loaded with the disdain of the just men whom they have too
long mocked at, let them continue their existence unpitied and
unnoticed.</p>
                    <p>“We have sworn to show no mercy to those who may dare to
speak to us of slavery. We shall be inexorable, perhaps cruel
toward the troops, who, forgetting the object for which from
1789 they have not ceased to fight, may come from Europe to
inflict on us servitude and death; nothing will be too dear to be
sacrificed, nothing impossible to be executed, by men from whom
it may be wished to snatch the first of all blessings. Should we
be obliged to shed rivers of blood, should we, to preserve our
freedom, be compelled to set on fire seven-eighths of the globe,
we shall be pronounced innocent before the tribunal of 
Providence, who has not created men to see them groan under a yoke
so oppressive and so ignominious.</p>
                    <p>“If in the different commotions which have taken place, some
residents of whom we have no reason to complain, have been
victims of the cruelty of soldiers or of planters, rendered by their
past evils too blind to be capable of distinguishing good and
humane proprietors from those who were insensible and cruel, we,
with all generous minds, bewail their deplorable lot, and we 
declare, in face of the universe, whatever evilly-disposed persons
may say, that those murders have been committed contrary to
tile desires of our hearts. It was impossible, especially in the
crisis through which the colony has gone, to prevent or to stop
those horrors. Those who have the slightest knowledge of 
<pb id="beard289" n="289"/>
history, are aware that a people, when a prey to civil discord, even
were it the most cultivated on earth, runs into excesses of all
kinds, and that the authority of chiefs, too little respected in
times of revolution, cannot punish all the guilty without continually 
creating new difficulties. But the Aurora of peace enables us
to descry the light of a less stormy future. Now that the calm
of victory has succeeded to the troubles of a terrible war, 
everything in Saint Domingo will take a new appearance, and 
henceforth its government will be the government of justice.</p>

            <p>These words were subscribed by the two great negro-chiefs and
a powerful mulatto leader, men with some exceptions worthy of
the sacred cause of which Toussaint L'Ouverture was the originator.
Happy for that cause and for the island, had the spirit of this
proclamation been observed. But Dessalines was by nature
cruel. The gradual means of a peaceful policy were regarded by
him as so many hindrances in his way. As slaves make the
worst of tyrants, so Dessalines, who began life in the lowest
condition of servitude, now that he had attained unbounded
power, proved the most violent and the most unsparing of
despots. And as in civil commotions the most depraved and
the most daring snatch the lead from moderate and virtuous men,
so Dessalines speedily set at nought Christophe and Clervaux,
and entered on a sanguinary and destructive career, in which his
soul had peculiar delight.</p>
            <p>There were two special reasons which dictated the mild and
just tenour of the preceding document. The population had been
thinned by the ravages of war. The ranks of the army required
to be recruited. Only in the possession of a strong military
force could the rulers of the island feel completely secure. It
was consequently important to check emigration, and procure
the return of natives who had settled in the neighbouring islands
and on the American continent. In order to augment his forces,
<pb id="beard290" n="290"/>
Dessalines offered to give to the captains of American vessels the
sum of forty dollars for every black or man of colour, whom they
should land on the shores of Saint Domingo. If such a step looks
like that purchase of men on which rests the servitude so strongly
condemned in the proclamation, the offer which Dessalines among
other commercial advantages made to Great Britain, namely,
the exclusive possession of the slave-trade in the island, shows
how little that half-savage understood the principles on which
the freedom of the country reposed, and how prepared he was
to augment his ranks by any means within his reach. Under
the rule of one so ignorant and so violent, a pacific settlement of
the disturbed, and to some extent conflicting interests of the
island, was in no way to be expected.</p>
            <p>Having, however, wrested their liberty out of the hands of its
assailants, the blacks took such measures as were in their power
for entering with advantage on their new and perilous career.
The very name of the island was offensive to them. The designation, 
Saint Domingo, as given by white men, was a badge and a
memento of the slavery out of which they had fought their way.
The original name was still current among the native population
in its more sequestered localities, and passing from mouth to
mouth, was treasured in the hearts of thousands as a precious
remnant of bygone and happy days. With that name old 
historic memories were connected, and family pride made that name
a part of its own rude heraldry. Consequently one of the earliest
determinations on the part of the blacks, was to revive the 
appellation of Hayti. The change was as politic as it was becoming.
Under this favourite designation, on the 1st of January, 1804,
the island solemnly assumed sovereign power. In the name of
the people of Hayti, the generals and commanders of the army
signed and promulgated a formal declaration of independence.
That declaration contained an express renunciation of the authority 
of France. The subscribers swore one to the other to 
posterity, and to the world, that they would die rather than submit
to European domination.</p>
            <p>The solemn act was in every way proper and praiseworthy.
But who was to be at the head of the new commonwealth? That
<pb id="beard291" n="291"/>
the great actors on the occasion were military men, was more to
be regretted than blamed in a people whose army had won liberty
by their swords, and who were totally untrained to the procedures,
usages, and authority of civil society. But lamentable was it that
all those brave men should be willing or should be compelled to
bend the knee to the ruffian spirit of Dessalines. Jean-Jacques
Dessalines, however, was appointed Governor-general for life.
Still more, the island just redeemed from bondage, even while
proclaiming liberty, took to itself a new master, and gave to that
ferocious soldier the power to establish laws, to declare war, to
make peace, and even to appoint his successor. Little need we
wonder if forthwith we find this Governor-general offering to our
eyes the prototype of the President of the French Republic, who,
from bloodshed and tyranny, has recently vaulted into an imperial
throne. In one respect, history is only a series of repetitions.
Ignorance, passion, and blind self-interest have ever been the
prolific parents of servitude and despotism.</p>
            <p>Having, by a show of mildness, gained the advantage which he
sought, of securing time for affairs to settle, for the increase of
his forces, and the acquisition of power, Dessalines, a few weeks
after his appointment as Governor for life, threw aside the mask,
and raised the cry of “Hayti for the Haytians,” thinking by 
proscribing foreigners he should most effectually consolidate his own
authority. For the furtherance of his self-aggrandisement, he
published a proclamation, in which he said—</p>
            <p>“Is it enough to have driven from our country the barbarians,
who for ages have covered it with blood? It is not sufficient
to have put down the successive factions who, in turn, have
sported with the phantom of liberty which France put before
their eyes. It has become necessary, by a final act of national
authority, to secure the permanent empire of liberty in this
country, which is our patrimony and our conquest. It is necessary 
to remove from that inhuman government which hitherto
has held our minds in a state of humiliating torpor, every hope
of being able again to make us slaves. The generals who led
your forces against the tyranny, have not done enough. The
<pb id="beard292" n="292"/>
French name still prevails in all places. Every object recalls the
cruelties of that barbarous people. Our laws, our customs, our
cities—in a word, everything bears the impress of France. What
do I say? There yet remain Frenchmen in our island. For
fourteen years, victims of our credulity and our toleration; 
conquered, not by the French armies, but by the artificial eloquence
of the proclamations of their agents, when shall we be tired of
breathing the same air as they? What have we in common with
that sanguinary people? Their cruelty, compared with our
moderation, their colour compared with our colour, the extent of
ocean which separates us, our avenging climate—everything shows
that they are not our brethren; that they will never be so; and
if they find an asylum amongst us, they will become the instigators 
of troubles and divisions. Citizens—men, women, children,
and old men, cast your eyes around you over this island; seek for
your wives, your husbands, your brothers, your sisters—what do
I say? seek for your infants, your infants at the breast, what has
become of them? Instead of those interesting victims, the eye
sees only their assassins; tigers, still covered with blood, whose
frightful presence reproaches you with your insensibility, and with
your slowness to punish them. Why do you delay to appease
their shades? Do you hope that your remains will rest in peace
by the side of those of your fathers, if you do not banish tyranny?
Will you go down into your graves without having avenged
them? Their bones will repel yours. And you, brave race,
intrepid warriors, who, insensible to your private ills, have given
life to freedom, by shedding your blood, know that you have done
nothing, if you do not give to the world a terrible but just
example of the vengeance which ought to be exerted by a brave
people that has recovered its liberty, and is resolved to maintain
it. Let us astound those who would dare to try to rob us of it
again; let us begin with the French; let them tremble in 
approaching our shores, if not at the recital of the cruelties which
they have committed, at least at the terrible resolution we are
about to form, to devote to death every Frenchman who shall
dare to stain with his sacrilegious steps this, land of liberty.
Slaves—leave that odious epithet to the French nation; they
<pb id="beard293" n="293"/>
deserve to be no longer free. Let us follow other footsteps; let
us imitate other nations, who, directing their eyes into the future,
and fearing to leave to posterity an example of cowardice, have
preferred extermination, rather than to be struck out alive from
the list of nations. Let us meanwhile be on our guard, lest a
spirit of proselytism destroy our work. Let our neighbours live
in peace; peace with our neighbours; but cursed be the French
name; eternal hatred to France! Such are our principles. Let
us swear to live free and independent, and to prefer death to
slavery. Let us swear to pursue for ever the traitors and the
enemies of our independence.”</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied that the prospect, however faint, of 
another effort on the part of France to subjugate and enslave the
island—a prospect kept constantly before the eyes of the Haytian
leaders, by the intrigues and entreaties of the colonists in Paris—
offers some reason, if it affords no excuse, for the ferocity of this
authoritative document; nor is it impossible that the stratagems
put in play to operate on the French government, may have been
viewed with approbation, if they were not secretly supported, by
sympathisers in Saint Domingo. Still Dessalines was under a
solemn pledge to respect the persons and the property of the
French residents; and if any of them were, on valid grounds,
suspected of tampering with the liberty of their fellow-citizens,
they should have been prosecuted, and on being convicted, duly
punished. But it may be doubted whether the fear of invasion,
and the fear of internal treachery, were anything more than idle,
or, at any rate, welcome pretexts for commencing a system of
terror which Dessalines intended, and expected to turn to his own
account.</p>
            <p>The instigations employed by Dessalines to rouse the people to
revenge, produced less effect than their author anticipated, for
the army, as well as the inhabitants, were weary of bloodshed.
In consequence, he resolved to accomplish his sanguinary designs
by a military expedition. Traversing the towns where Frenchmen 
had remained, the monster put all to the sword, with a few
exceptions, spared by acts of special grace. At the Cape, where
<pb id="beard294" n="294"/>
the tragedy was enacted on the night of the 20th of April, the
massacre was general; only about one-tenth of the inhabitants
escaped. One fact brands Dessalines with perfidy as well as 
ruthlessness. A proclamation was published in the journals, declaring 
that the vengeance due to the crimes of the French had been
sufficiently exacted, and inviting all those who had survived the
butchery, to appear in the public square, that they might receive
certificates of protection. Many came forth from their hiding
places; immediately they were hurried to the place of execution,
and shot.</p>
            <p>The vindictive measures of Dessalines were far from being
generally approved, even among his companions in arms. 
Christophe condemned them, but from a regard to his own safety, held
his peace. Dessalines, however, took credit for the course he
pursued, as appears from the following words, borrowed from a
proclamation which he issued:—</p>
            <p>“Crimes the most atrocious—crimes till then unknown—
crimes which make human nature shudder—were committed by
the French.</p>
            <p>“At last the hour of vengeance has come, and the implacable
enemies of the rights of man have received the punishment they
deserved. My arm, raised above their heads, too long hesitated
to strike. At that signal which the justice of God called forth,
your hand, sternly armed, applied the axe to the root of slavery
and prejudice. In vain had time, and still more, the infernal
policy of Europeans, surrounded the tree with triple brass: you
tore off the covering, which you placed in your hearts, and, like
your enemies, you became cruel and pitiless.</p>
            <p>“As an overflowing torrent, which breaks down whatever it
meets with in its course, so your avenging fury bore away every
obstacle. Let them perish—all the tyrants of innocence, all the
oppressors of the human species!</p>
            <p>“What! bowed down for centuries under a yoke of iron, 
playthings of the passions and of the injustice of men, and of the
caprices of fortune; mutilated victims of the cupidity of the
French;—after having, with unexampled patience and resignation,
<pb id="beard295" n="295"/>
enriched those insatiable oppressors by means of our labours,
we should have seen that sacrilegious horde make another attempt
at our destruction; and we, whom they call men without energy
and without courage, should not have plunged into their heart
the dagger of despair! Intolerable. Where is the Haytian so
vile, so unworthy of his regeneration, as to think that he has not
fulfilled the decrees of heaven, in exterminating those sanguinary
tigers? If there is one such, let him fly; may insulted nature
drive him from our company—allow him to drag his infamy at
a distance from ourselves! The air we breathe cannot suit his
apathetic organs; it is the air of liberty,—it is pure, august,
triumphant!</p>
            <p>“Yes! we have given back to those anthropophagi war for
war, crime for crime, outrage for outrage. Yes! I have saved my
country, I have avenged America! The vow which I made in
the face of heaven and of earth, is my pride and my glory. What
to me is the opinion which will be entertained of my conduct by
my contemporaries, and by future generations? I have done my
duty; I approve my conduct—that suffices.</p>
            <p>“But the preservation of my unfortunate brethren, and the
testimony of my conscience, are not my only reward. I saw two
classes of men, born to aid, protect, and cherish each other,
mingled together in a part of the world, crying out for revenge,
and disputing who should strike the first blow. Blacks, and men
of colour, whom the perfidious policy of the Europeans has so
long sought to divide, you who now are united and form only
one family, doubtless it was necessary that your reconciliation
should be sealed with the blood of your murderers. The same
calamities hung over your proscribed heads; the same ardour to
smite your enemies has signalized you; the same destiny is
reserved for you; and your common interests ought in future to
render you inseparable. Preserve this precious concord—this
happy union; it is the pledge of your liberty, of your success, of
your felicity; it is the secret of being invincible.</p>
            <p>“In order to strengthen this union, you must be reminded of
the atrocities committed against our species. The premeditated
massacre of the entire population of this island, resolved in the
<pb id="beard296" n="296"/>
silence of the cabinet!—the execution of this abominable project
was imprudently proposed to me, when it had already been 
commenced by the French, with the calm and the serenity of a
countenance accustomed to such crimes.</p>
            <p>“Guadaloupe pillaged and destroyed, its ruins yet smoking with
the blood of its children—the women and the old men put to the
sword! Pelage himself a victim of their perfidy, after having
basely betrayed his country and his brethren! The brave and
immortal Delgresse, blown up with the fort which he defended,
rather than submit to their chains. Magnanimous warrior! that
noble death, far from weakening our courage, will serve only to
augment in us the resolution to avenge thee and to follow thee.
The deplorable destiny of our brethren scattered in Europe, and
(frightful forerunner of death) the terrible despotism exerted in
Martinique! Unhappy people, would that I could fly to your
aid and break your chains! Alas, an insurmountable barrier
separates us; but perhaps a spark of the fire which inflames us,
will kindle up in your hearts; perhaps at the report of this 
revolution, you, suddenly awakened from your lethargy, will, with
arms in your hands, demand your sacred and inviolable rights.</p>
            <p>“After the terrible example which I have given, may divine
justice sooner or later send on earth men of strong minds, superior
to vulgar weakness, for the terror and the destruction of the
wicked. Tremble! usurping tyrants, pests of the New World;
our poniards are sharpened, your punishment is at hand! Sixty
thousand men equipped, hardened to war, obedient to my orders,
burn to offer a new sacrifice to the manes of their assassinated
brethren. Let that nation come, if it is senseless enough, or rash
enough to attack me. Already, at its approach, the exasperated
Genius of Hayti, rising from the depths of the ocean, shows his
threatening form; he stirs up the waves; he excites the tempests;
and with his puissant hand scatters and destroys hostile fleets.
The laws of nature obey his formidable voice—plague, famine,
fire, poison await his command. But why reckon on the aid of
the climate and the elements? Have I forgotten that I 
command a people whose courage repels obstacles, and grows by
dangers? Let those homicidal cohorts come! I wait for them
<pb id="beard297" n="297"/>
with a firm foot and a calm eye. I freely resign to them the
shores and the spots where towns were; but woe to those who
come too near the mountains; better would it have been for them
to be swallowed up in the depths of the sea, than to be torn to
pieces by the furious hands of the children of Hayti.</p>
            <p>“War against the tyrants—always war—war till death: that
is my motto;—Liberty, independence: that is our rallying cry.</p>
            <p>“Generals, officers, soldiers; differing from him by whom I
was preceded, the ex-general Toussaint L'Ouverture, I have been
faithful to the promise which I made you when I took up arms
against tyranny, and as long as I live I will keep my oath.
Never shall a colonist or a European set foot on this territory
with the title of master or proprietor. This resolution shall
henceforth form the fundamental basis of our Constitution.</p>
            <p>“If other chiefs, after me, in following an entirely opposite
course, shall dig their graves, and that of their fellow patriots,
then you will have to accuse only the law of that destiny which
shall have prevented me from rendering my fellow citizens free
and happy. May my successors follow the plan which I have
traced for them; it is the best system to consolidate their power;
it is the greatest homage they can pay to my memory.</p>
            <p>“As it is derogatory to my dignity to punish the innocent for
the crimes of the guilty, a handful of whites, commendable for the
sentiments which they have always professed, and who, besides,
have sworn to live with us in the woods, have experienced my
clemency. I direct that they be allowed to live, and that they
be not maltreated.</p>
            <p>“I again command and order all the generals of the departments 
to give succour, protection, and encouragement, to all
neutral or allied nations, who may wish to establish commercial
relations in this island.”</p>
            <p>The energy of this official document is terrible. What a 
volcanic soul was that of Dessalines! And if we are bound by every
moral consideration to reprobate its spirit in the strongest terms,
equally are we in justice bound to remember that this fury had
been sharpened and intensified in those previous conflicts in which
<pb id="beard298" n="298"/>
professed Christians were the aggressors. Nor, shocking and
atrocious as is the revenge which here burns and rages, can it be
denied that while some palliation may be found in the prevalent
rumours that France was about to make another and yet more
powerful attempt, so fierce a resolution and so fiery a wrath could
not be without effect in deterring the enemy, and guaranteeing
the shores of Hayti from another series of ravages and crimes.</p>
            <p>A small French force remained in possession of Santo Domingo;
and the Spaniards who, on the evacuation of the Cape, acknowledged 
the new government, had, under the impulse of the priests,
been induced to break their promise of obedience to the blacks,
and to espouse the cause of France. The subjugation of Spanish
Hayti became the supreme object of importance with Dessalines.
A few days before he entered on the campaign intended to effect
his purpose, he published a proclamation addressed to the
Spaniards, accusing them of treason, and calling on them to
submit. “Yet a few moments, and I will overwhelm the remains
of the French under the weight of my omnipotence. Spaniards!
you whom I address, because I desire to save you; you who though
guilty of desertion, may preserve your existence and find my
clemency ready to spare you, it is yet time—abjure an error which
may be fatal to you, break all the ties which bind you to my
enemies, if you do not wish your blood to be mingled with theirs.
I give you a fortnight from this date, to acquaint me with your
final intentions and to gather under my flag. You know what I
can do, and what I have done; think of your preservation. Receive
the sacred promise which I give never to make any attack against
your personal safety and interests, if you seize the opportunity of
showing yourselves worthy of being numbered among the children
of Hayti.” On the 14th of May, Dessalines quitted Cap-Français,
and having traversed the western and the southern provinces,
advanced toward the east, and sat down to besiege Santo Domingo.
After abortive attempts to overcome the resistance of the citizens,
who hated the blacks, he judged it advisable to retire, and returned
to Port-au-Prince. His return was soon followed by a fearful
revolution which after some months made Hayti an empire, and
placed on its throne one who, from the condition of a slave, had
<pb id="beard299" n="299"/>
raised himself to be the first magistrate of a republic, now no
more. The coronation took place on the 8th of October, 1804,
about two months before a similar farce was enacted by 
Bonaparte. Though Dessalines had waded through blood to the throne,
the clergy were among the first to salute him as emperor. The
civil ceremony was followed by a religious service; a <hi rend="italics">Te Deum</hi>
was performed, and the new monarch led the choir, singing the
words in the strongest voice there was in his majesty's dominions.
The institution of the imperial dignity was accompanied by the
grant of a constitution, which proceeding on the basis that the
empire of Hayti was free, sovereign, and independent, proclaimed
the abolition of slavery, the equality of ranks, the authority of
the same laws for all, the inviolability of property, the loss of
civil rights by emigration, and the suspension of those rights by
bankruptcy, the exclusion of all whites, from the right of acquiring
property, except those who had been naturalized; and the adoption 
of the generic name of blacks, for all the subjects of Hayti,
whatever their colour. It was further declared that no one was
worthy to be a Haytian, if he was not a good father, a good son,
a good husband, and especially a good soldier. Parents were not
permitted to disinherit their children, and every citizen was
required to practise some mechanical art. The empire of Hayti,
one and indivisible, contained ten military governments, each
commanded by a general; every commander was independent of
the rest, and was to correspond directly with the head of the
government, who to the title of emperor joined that of 
commander-in-chief of the army. The last article of the constitution
stated that Dessalines, the avenger and the liberator of his
countrymen, was called to fulfil those functions, and that he would
reign under the name of Jean-Jacques the first.</p>
            <p>The title of majesty was conferred on the new emperor as well
as on his august consort, the empress; their persons were 
declared inviolable, and the crown elective; but the emperor had
the right to nominate his successor among a chosen number of
candidates. The sons of the sovereign were to pass through all
the ranks of the army. Every emperor who should attach to
himself a privileged body under the name of guard of honour or
<pb id="beard300" n="300"/>
any other designation, was by the fact to be regarded as at war
with the nation, and should be driven from the throne, which
then was to be occupied by one of the councillors of state chosen
by the majority of the members of that body. The emperor had
the right to make, approve, and publish the laws; to appoint
and dismiss public functionaries; to direct the receipts and the
expenses of the state, and the coining of money; to make peace
and war; to conclude treaties; to distribute the armed force at
his pleasure: he also possessed the exclusive prerogative of
pardon.</p>
            <p>The generals of division and of brigade were to form part of
the council of state. Besides a secretary of state, there was to
be a minister of finances and a minister of war. All persons were
encouraged to settle their differences by arbitration. No dominant
religion was admitted; the liberty of worship was proclaimed;
the state was not to take on itself the support of any religious
institution. Marriage was declared a purely civil act, and in
some cases divorce was permitted. State offences were to be
tried by a council to be named by the emperor. All property
belonging to white Frenchmen was confiscated to the state. The
houses of the citizens were pronounced inviolable.</p>
            <p>The constitution was placed under the safeguard of the 
magistrates, of fathers, of mothers, of citizens, and of soldiers, and 
recommended to their descendants, to all the friends of liberty, to
the philanthropists of all countries, as a striking token of the
goodness of God, who in the order of his immortal decrees had
given the Haytians power to break their bonds, and make themselves 
a free, civilized, and independent people. This constitution 
which, considering its origin, contains so much that is excellent, 
and which even the long civilized states of Europe might
advantageously study, was accepted by the emperor, and ordered
to be forthwith carried into execution.</p>
            <p>The condition of the farm-labourer was the same as under the
system of Toussaint L'Ouverture; he laboured for wages which
were fixed at one-fourth of the produce, and that produce was
abundant. The whip and all corporal punishments were abolished.
Idleness was regarded as a crime, but was punished only by 
<pb id="beard301" n="301"/>
imprisonment. Two-thirds of the labour exacted under slavery was
the amount required under the new system. Thus the labourers
gained a diminution of one-third of their toil, while their wants
were amply supplied. It was decreed that the black labourers
could labour only in the divisions to which they had been 
aforetime attached; but if they had any reasons for changing, the
commissioner of the district would give them permission. The
greater number of the properties having been confiscated, were
in the hands of the government; but they were let at an annual
rent, and that rent was determined according to, not the extent
of the soil, but the number of the labourers. The mulattoes,
or quarterons, children of whites and mulattoes, who were very
numerous, if they could show any relationship, whether legitimate
or not, with the old white proprietors, were allowed to inherit
their property.</p>
            <p>The census of the inhabitants of the island in the parts subject
to Dessalines, which took place in 1805, represented the population 
as then amounting to about 380,000, with about 20,000 from
various causes not included. Of these 400,000 the adult males
were only a small proportion, so much had their ranks been
thinned by war and massacre; the majority of labourers were
women. Marriage, solemnized according to the rites of the
Roman church, was almost universal, and its duties were, in
general, well observed, in spite of the example of the emperor.
The army consisted of 15,000 men, of whom 1500 were cavalry;
they were well armed and well disciplined, but badly clothed. The
uniform was blue, turned up with red. All adult males fit for
service, were four times a year drilled during several days.
Emigration was put under the most rigorous restraints. An
effectual system of self-defence was devised and executed, with a
view to prepare against invasion.</p>
            <p>In the midst of these outward and material arrangements,
education was not neglected. Schools were established in nearly
all the districts, and the negroes seeing what advantage was
possessed by those among them who had received instruction,
attached great importance to it, and there were few of them who
did not at least learn to read and to write.</p>
            <pb id="beard302" n="302"/>
            <p>At the time of the insurrection of 1791, the emperor Jean
Jacques was a slave under a black proprietor, named Dessalines,
from whom he derived his own appellation. In 1805, that man
was still alive; he dwelt at the Cape, and witnessed the elevation
of his old servant to the imperial throne. He was accustomed
to say, that the emperor had always been “a headstrong dog, but
a good workman.” Dessalines continued to entertain a great
esteem for him, and made him his head butler. When asked
why he had not given him a more honourable post, he replied
that no other would have pleased him so much, as he was fond
of good wine, and would drink for both. The emperor, although
he had the best furnished wine-cellar in the island, drank scarcely
anything but water.</p>
            <p>Jean Jacques Dessalines, Emperor of Hayti, was small in
person, but strongly made; of great activity, and indomitable
courage. He knew not how to read, but he had learned to sign
his name; as he was desirous of instruction, he employed a
reader, to whom he listened with much attention. It has been
affirmed that his military talents were superior to those of
Toussaint L'Ouverture. However this may be, in all other
respects he was greatly inferior to that unfortunate chief. Though
open, affable, and even generous, he inspired fear rather than
respect. He was remarkable for strange caprices, the evident
effect of his personal vanity; now he was covered with embroidery
and other ornaments, and attired with magnificence; yet often
he appeared in public in the most wretched garb. But what was
more singular and more ridiculous, he had the ambition to be
accounted an accomplished dancer, and always had with him a
dancing-master, who gave him lessons in his leisure moments;
nor was it possible to pay him a more agreeable compliment than
to tell him how well he danced, though he was very <sic corr="unskillful">unskilful</sic> in
that amusement, in which negroes ordinarily excel. He had
daughters by his first wife, but no sons. His last wife had been
the favourite mistress of a rich planter, from whom she had received
a superior education. She was one of the finest negresses of the
West Indies; her character was mild, and she often employed
<pb id="beard303" n="303"/>
her ascendancy over Dessalines to soften his natural ferocity;
unhappily, she sometimes failed in her benevolent efforts.</p>
            <p>During some time, the Emperor Jean Jacques practised the
cruelties to which his nature was prone only on the whites, but
soon he spared not even his own colour. The suspicions of a
mind disquieted as to his own authority, led him to put to death,
without any judicial formalities, citizens and soldiers. Every
effort he thus made to terminate his solicitudes, served only to
augment them, His caprices, his atrocities, were carried to such
a point, that the heads of his army conspired, and suddenly, on
the 17th October, 1806, put him under arrest. In endeavouring
to escape, he received a blow, which put an end to his life, and
to the imperial government in the island of Hayti.</p>

            <argument>
              <p>Feud between mulatto and negro blood, occasioning strife and political conflicts—
Christophe president and sovereign in the north—Pétion president in the
south—The two districts are united under Boyer—Riché—Soulouque, the
present emperor.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE framers of the constitution under which Dessalines became
the emperor of Hayti, in decreeing that the inhabitants in general
should be denominated <hi rend="italics">blacks,</hi> made a praiseworthy effort to
extinguish the distinctions of colour which had occasioned so much
calamity. But such distinctions are stronger than the words of
which state resolutions consist, which have little power and
durability, unless they are the embodiment not only of the
national will, but also of the national character. Unfortunately,
the distinctions in question, which rested on prejudices and 
antipathies deeply planted in human nature, had been aggravated by
a long series of sanguinary contentions, and though now somewhat 
abated, still retained an influence both decided and noxious.
It was a great, however pardonable, mistake to suppose that
distinctions, which only ages, under the force of common institutions 
and good government, can effectually obliterate, could,
<pb id="beard304" n="304"/>
within a few years, and amid conflicting social elements, be 
annihilated and disowned. And though their disavowal did 
something toward their extinction, and the counsellors who caused
that disavowal deserve the gratitude of the friends of humanity,
yet is there no ground for surprise, if their effort proved illusory.
How small was its immediate effect, events will speedily show.
The aristocracy of the skin retained in Hayti sufficient force to
occasion jealousies, discord, and war among those who ought to
have been united in one combined effort for the good of the
country. But the mulatto blood could not brook the ascendancy
of the negro blood. Its pride and its disdain were fed by long
conflicts and inveterate animosities. Conscious of that 
individual superiority which ensues from a share in the influences of
civilization, the mulattoes of Hayti despised the untaught and the
rude crowd of black labourers by whom they were surrounded,
and felt, that in submitting to their sway, they put themselves
under the domination of a majority, whose authority lay 
exclusively in their numbers. Their natural position, they believed, was
at the head of the Haytian government. Could they have peaceably 
taken that position, they would probably in a measure have
forgotten their own party interests, and laboured for the diffusion, 
through the great body of the people, of the higher influences
of civilization. But there was an alternative. They might have
employed an elevated position for their own exclusive aggrandisement. 
This possibility the blacks could not disallow, the rather that
hitherto they had found in the yellow blood the most virulent of
the opponents with whom they had had to deal. Not without
reason, therefore, did they look with suspicion and jealousy on all
attempts at political elevation which were made by mulattoes.
It is even to be feared that the blacks, under their distrust and
fears, were much averse to the culture which education gives,
and of which the mulattoes, who possessed some tincture of
European civilization, were, in their eyes, the representatives.
Thus the progress of the island, in those arts and attainments on
which the good of society consists, was materially retarded, and
the way paved for a renewal of strife and bloodshed, with their
demoralizing effects.</p>
            <pb id="beard305" n="305"/>
            <p>On the death of Dessalines, the news of which spread joy
among the inhabitants, the supreme power naturally fell into the
hands of Christophe, who, with good reason, had long been 
recognised as the second chief in the state. Well acquainted with
the great interests of which he undertook the care, and thoroughly
experienced in Haytian warfare, Christophe, who enjoyed a high
reputation for humanity and benevolence, and who, in addition
to the domestic virtues, was actuated by a practical sense of 
religion, seemed to possess the best guarantees for a useful, if not a
happy, career. Free from the vanity of his predecessor, he 
discarded the pompous title of Emperor, and took that of Chief
Governor of Hayti. With befitting sagacity, he began his sway
by directing his attention to the encouragement of agriculture
and commerce. Specially desirous was he to see in his ports the
merchant vessels of distant nations, and with that view he, on the
24th of October, 1806, put forth a proclamation, in which he
promised neutral powers protection and favour.</p>
            <p>While engaged in peaceful improvements, he suddenly found
himself necessitated to prepare for war. The old feud between
the negro and the mulatto blood broke out afresh. Unable to
endure the supremacy of a negro who had been a slave, the
mulatto Pétion resolved to put forward his claim to political
power and dignity. Pétion possessed superior advantages.
Having been educated in the military school of Paris, he was
esteemed for his knowledge, and accounted the best engineer
officer in the native forces. Christophe himself entertained a high
opinion of his military abilities. The two competitors had 
recourse to arms. A battle was fought on the 1st of January,
1807, which issued in the defeat of Pétion. His successful rival
pursued him to the gates of Port-au-Prince, his head-quarters.
Hoping to complete his triumph, and so to consolidate his power,
Christophe undertook the siege of that city, but was compelled
to retire without effecting its capture. The hostilities led to
little else than the enfeeblement of both parties. The black chief,
however, established his power on solid foundations in the north,
while Pétion succeeded in retaining a firm position in the south.
Thus was the island once more unhappily divided between two
<pb id="beard306" n="306"/>
authorities, each of which watched its opportunity for the 
overthrow of the other.</p>
            <p>The war in which he had been engaged, and in which he had
gained only partial success, made Christophe feel the necessity of
augmenting his strength. The progress which he had made
over the north, with a view to the assertion and establishment of
his authority, had revived in him the knowledge that the negro
character is by nature predisposed in favour of the monarchical
form of government. He resolved, therefore, to take a step in
that direction. On his return to Cap François he assembled a
council, composed of generals and the principal citizens. On the
17th of February, 1807, that council decreed a new Constitution.
At its head was Christophe, with the title of President. The
office was for life, and carried with it the right to select, among
the general officers of the State, a successor. The constitution
abolished slavery, declaring every individual free that resided in
Hayti. The Roman Catholic religion was established, with toleration 
of every other form of worship. Schools were opened in
every district. Arrangements were also made for the administration 
of justice, the encouragement of agriculture and commerce,
and the security of the neighbouring colonies.</p>
            <p>The time occupied by these regulations was employed by Pétion
in making preparations for a renewal of active operations in the
field, while Christophe, on his side, was firmly resolved to extend his
rule over the whole island. Soon was the country again rent and
torn by intestine war. The conflict was long and dubious. Now
the one chief, now the other, gained the advantage. Every defeat
and every victory seemed to serve only to augment the fury and
confirm the determination of both. During the collisions the
country at large suffered greatly. Agriculture was hindered or
arrested. Education was suspended. Wealth, instead of growing, 
decreased, and seemed likely to vanish. The two 
combatants became weary of a strife in which victory was baneful to
the land over which they aspired to rule. At length the reduction 
of Môle Saint Nicholas by Christophe, a decisive blow to his
competitor, put a period to the destructive hostilities, and afforded
to the island time and scope to recover from its losses. The war
<pb id="beard307" n="307"/>
was ended, but not the division. The two chiefs withdrew into
their respective territories.</p>
            <p>The time had now arrived when Christophe judged it desirable
to complete his plan of self-elevation. In the spring of 1811 he
assumed the title of King, with the almost unanimous consent,
not only of the populace, but also of his chief men. He made
Cap François the capital of his dominions, and proceeded to
surround himself with all the pomp and parade of feudal royalty.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Rigaud, having escaped from prison, landed in
Hayti, and offered his co-operation to Pétion. It was eagerly
accepted. But jealousy soon separated the two mulattoes, and
Rigaud, having been appointed Pétion's commander in the south,
retained his authority, and so gave rise to three rival powers in
the island. Resolved to profit by this division, Christophe
marched against Pétion; but the common danger brought about
a union, and Christophe judged it prudent to retire. The peril
over, the two men of colour again quarrelled. The city of Cayes
was urged into revolt against Rigaud, who, in attempting to bring
it back to obedience, lost his life. His rights, such as they were,
fell to the share of his general, Borgella. Pétion was about to
take measures to dispossess him, when the unexpected approach
of Christophe effected a reconciliation. The sable monarch, 
however, was driven back by Borgella, who now fought on the side of
Pétion, aided by the mulatto general, Boyer, who is about to
appear on the scene as the principal character.</p>
            <p>With these events the conflict between the north and the
south may be said to have terminated. As soon as his mind was
free from the cares of warfare, Pétion, at the head of a republic in
the south, applied all his powers, and not without effect, to
the improvement of the condition of those whom be governed.
Accessible and courteous to all, while Christophe affected grandeur
and distance, Pétion gained general good-will, and turned his
influence to account for the amelioration of his territories and the
consolidation of his power. Labouring indefatigably, he did his
utmost to ensure the due cultivation of the land, to administer
justice, and to promote order. He was rewarded with great
success, and came to be loved and revered; but he found his task
<pb id="beard308" n="308"/>
one of great difficulty, and partly from want of power to give
effect to his own views, and partly owing to prevalent ignorance
and grossness of manners, he was often impeded in his efforts and
frustrated in his hopes.</p>
            <p>France had never given up the hope of resuming possession of
Hayti. During the wars of the empire she had other occupation
for her resources. But when Bonaparte had fallen, the old
colonists recovered their hopes and resumed their efforts. They
succeeded in getting a commission appointed. The report was so
favourable as to throw the planters into a transport of joy. In
1814, three commissioners were sent to the West Indies, who
were directed to transmit to the French Government the result
of their inquiries relative to the condition of Hayti. Lavayasse,
who was at its head, made overtures to Christophe and Pétion.
From the former he received an indignant repulse; with the
latter he succeeded in gaining an interview at Port-au-Prince.
The commissioner, with very ample promises, invited the president
to recognise Louis XVIII. The propositions were rejected.
Disappointed in these pacific efforts, the colonists clamoured for
war. Preparations were made, and a fleet was to sail in the
spring of the year 1815. But before the time came Bonaparte
was at large, and preparations for the battle of Waterloo absorbed
all minds. Anxious to obtain all possible aid, that adventurer
adapted his policy to his condition, and having once done his best
to perpetuate slavery, he now decreed the abolition of the 
infamous traffic in human bodies and souls; and at the same time
sent to Hayti propositions intended to win back the island. He
retained the sceptre too short a time to receive a reply. As soon
as the Bourbons were again restored, the colonists renewed their
intrigues. In the middle of the year 1816 they succeeded in
obtaining the appointment of commissioners, who were to assume
the civil and military government of the island, tacitly 
superseding the actual authorities. They sailed to Hayti, and made
an attempt to obtain a hearing, but in vain; they returned to
France only to show how fruitless their mission had proved.</p>
            <p>The unhesitating rejection of these overtures from France was
the last important act performed by Pétion. That chief had long
<pb n="309"/>
been drooping under the combined effects of disease and 
disappointment; his depression was witnessed by those whom he
governed with sympathy and regret. Every means was taken to
give his mind relief. But the disorder grew worse: he became
suspicious, fancied conspiracies, distrusted his best friends, looked
on the past with regret, and feared to encounter the future. In this
melancholy, he finally put an end to his existence by voluntarily
abstaining from food. He expired on the 29th of March, 1818,
at the age of forty-eight, appointing, with general approbation,
Jean-Pierre Boyer as his successor. His death occasioned general
sorrow.</p>
            <p>Jean-Pierre Boyer, a mulatto, born at Port-au-Prince on the 2nd
of February, 1776, received in Paris the advantages of European
culture; fought under Rigaud against Toussaint L'Ouverture;
and in consequence of the success which the black leader 
obtained, quitted the island. Boyer returned to Hayti in Leclerc's
expedition; he, however, separated from the French General-in-chief, 
and placed himself at the head of his own colour. Together
with Pétion, he kept quiet in order to husband his strength,
while Dessalines was expelling the French from the island. But
when, on the death of Dessalines, Christophe, already master of
the north, sought to take the south out of Pétion's hands, Boyer
aided his fellow-mulatto to withstand the black ruler. Gratitude,
as well as a regard to the common security, gave Boyer the
President's chair on the death of Pétion. Raised to that dignity,
he employed his power and his energies to complete those 
economical and administrative reforms with which he had already been
connected under his predecessor. To labour for the public good
was the end of his life. In this worthy enterprise he was greatly
assisted no less by his knowledge than his moderation. Well
acquainted with the negro and mulatto character, and conversant
with all the interests of the state, he had it in his power to effect
his purposes by mild as well as judicious measures. Yet were
the wounds deep which he had to heal; and he could accomplish
in a brief period only a small part of that which it will require
generations to carry to perfection.</p>
            <p>While Boyer, with determination and firmness, and with the
<pb id="beard310" n="310"/>
aid of superior men, was promoting the improvement of his
republic, Christophe had painful experience that a crown is no
protection against either internal or external troubles. His 
subjects began to find that the glitter of court apparel and 
high-sounding names is soon tarnished, and affords a poor repayment
for its cost. The monarch was struck with paralysis, and 
confined within the Château de Sans-Souci, his favourite residence.
What to him appeared a trifling incident occasioned his 
overthrow and death. An order for the degradation of a colonel
who was loved by his soldiers caused the garrison of Saint Marc,
consisting of 6000 men, to break out into revolt. On hearing of
the insurrection, Christophe commanded 12,000 men to march
against the revolters; but those troops themselves proved hostile
to their sovereign. The only force on whose fidelity he could
count was his own body-guard. Them he reviewed as he lay in
his litter; and having bestowed on each a gift of four dollars, he
despatched them against the rebels. Midway they encountered
the enemy, who came on with shouts of “Liberty for ever!”
Whether this cry captivated their minds, or whether they were
impressed with the inutility of opposition, Christophe's guard
joined the soldiers of the Cape, and in one body marched against
the residence of their former master. A report of the defection
reached Sans-Souci before their arrival. As soon as it had come
to the ears of Christophe, feigning to need repose, he withdrew
into his chamber. Then he called his wife and his children, who
ranged themselves around the bed on which he sat. He gave
caresses to his daughters, asked for some linen, threw a mournful
look on his son, and, without uttering another word, made a sign
for all to retire. Then, having obtained some water, he washed
his hands and his arms, as if he wished to purify himself, changed
his clothes, covered his head with a handkerchief, and dismissed
his servants. They had not yet shut the door, when they heard
the report of a pistol. Returning into the room, they found
Christophe dead; the ball had gone through his heart. His body
was conveyed away by some soldiers to whom it was entrusted
by the queen, to be carried to a place which she indicated; but
the king of Hayti was, a few days afterwards, found half devoured
<pb id="beard311" n="311"/>
by beasts on the edge of a forest, where he had been thrown
without sepulture. Thus perished Henri, king of Hayti, after a
a reign of nine years (1811-20).</p>
            <p>Christophe was fifty-three years of age at the time of his death.
He was a man of pure morals and cold in manner, who gave
observers the idea of more depth of thought than he really 
possessed. English and French authorities have differed in regard
to his character. The English, whose nation and commerce he
favoured, have represented him not only as a man of the highest
genius, but also as a monarch equally wise and just. Others
have striven to set him forth as a sanguinary tyrant, and have
found the cause of his <sic corr="downfall">downfal</sic> in the excess of his cruelties.
Both views are exaggerations. With a mind little capable of
continuous thought, Christophe possessed a strong and obstinate
will. When once he had gained an elevated position, he 
manifested great energy of character. Having attained to the supreme
power of a throne, he found himself placed between the exertion
of absolute authority which he was compelled to maintain, and
the necessity of improving the people, that they might take rank
among the civilized nations of the world. The two duties were
not easily reconciled. Anxious to augment by commerce the
material strength of his dominions, and to develop its moral
power by education, he imposed on the emancipated blacks a
labour not unlike that of the days of their servitude, and called
forth intelligence in the minds of a half-brutish people. The
consequence was inevitable. Rigour produced discontent, and
discontent received power from knowledge. Under the combined
influence, Christophe fell. His life was not spent in vain. Not
only did he render important services in the war of liberation,
but even by his severity he compelled that industry to which
negroes in their own climes are indisposed, and without which
steady and continued progress in civilization is impossible.</p>
            <p>On the cessation of the reign of Henri I., as Christophe was
termed, General Paul Remain, Prince of Limbé, put himself at
the head of affairs, and proclaimed a republic, while others 
declared in favour of Christophe's son. On the 15th October, 1821,
the north and the north-west of Hayti formed themselves into a
<pb id="beard312" n="312"/>
commonwealth, of which Paul Romain was nominated President.
The chiefs of this government transmitted to Boyer the 
constituent act of their organization. Boyer sent it back unread,
and refused all aid so long as the north should keep separate
from the south. This state of division did not last long. On the
21st of October, Boyer took possession of Gonaïves without 
resistance. The next day he marched on the Cape, where the evening 
before, the principal inhabitants had met together to make
preparations for his reception. He entered the city at the head
of 20,000 men, and on the 26th was proclaimed President. In
the commencement of the year 1822, the Spanish part of the
island acceded, of its own accord, to the new republic, and thus
from Cape Tiburon to Cape Engano, Hayti was peacefully settled
under one government.</p>
            <p>While Hayti was thus making progress toward material 
prosperity, and preparing the way for rising from the bottom of the
sink of human culture, its old enemies, the colonists, never ceased
to put forward and enforce their claims. Abortive negotiations
were the consequence. At length, in 1825, after the recognition
of the independence of Hayti by others, the French, under
Charles X., sold to its inhabitants the rights which they had won
by their swords, for the sum of 150,000,000 of francs, to be
paid as an indemnity to the colonists.</p>
            <p>The form in which this act of emancipation was obtained,
dictated by the historical claims and usages of the French
monarchy, displeased the people; that displeasure was augmented
by the large sum of money which they would have to pay to the
planters. “Had not their enemies,” they asked, “already 
exacted enough from them! Must they continue to labour for men
who had ever shown the most embittered opposition to their 
interests?” Boyer's colour awakened distrust. “What is this
ordinance,” they said, “but an averment of the right divine of
French despotism; and what is our acceptance of it but an
acknowledgment of French sovereignty? We are betrayed by
our old foes, the men of colour. We must withstand the 
predominant influence of mulatto blood.” This jealousy threw serious
obstacles in Boyer's path. His reformatory measures were
<pb id="beard313" n="313"/>
obstructed. His efforts to promote agriculture, on which 
depended alike the wealth and the civilization of the country,
encountered resistance, as if they were designed for the gradual
restoration of slavery. The civilizing influences which his own
culture and the good of the country equally demanded, were
withstood by the brutishness of a suspicious Africanism which
was indisposed to learn, to labour, and to obey. One consequence
of these oppositions was inaction on the part of the Government.
Boyer's reign has been characterized as “a long slumber.” 
Certainly his power for good was curtailed, and he found that the
less be attempted, the more was he at his ease. Of course under
a system of comparative neglect the island made little progress.
Large portions of the country fell out of culture, for life is easily
supported in the West Indies; and in the decline of industry,
education made little way. Thus did the prejudices of colour
still prove adverse to the real good of the island. Nevertheless,
Boyer had on his side powerful allies—peace and time. Twenty
years of tranquillity had so softened men's minds that robbery
and murder were unknown. The pacific contact of the two
castes in a measure produced their fusion; the black party with
its extreme opinions daily grew less as fathers and grandfathers
passed into the grave; and Boyer and the intelligent men whom
he had around him, hoped that the time had arrived when they
could effectually put an end to barbarism.</p>
            <p>But a young party made its appearance, a party of progress as
it was called, but really a party of extravagance. The new 
generation, filled with extreme democratic ideas, accused the President
and his government with encouraging the very brutishness which
they were labouring to put away. Impatient of the slow movement 
of the country which Boyer had been compelled to accept,
and which he would have gladly accelerated, the heady reformers
were loud and bold in demanding changes, for which the people
were unfitted, and which could end in nothing but disappointment. 
That a nation is not born in a day, is a truth of which
they knew nothing. It was to no purpose that the President
pointed out to these ardent reformers whose leaders were men of
mulatto blood, and possessed of some culture, that they were
<pb id="beard314" n="314"/>
endangering the public weal by awakening the passions of the
ignorant populace. The suggestion indicated fear on the part of
the Government. The opposition then was likely to prove 
successful. Africanism, too, learned that it was feared, and hence rose
into a more threatening attitude. How formidable it might prove
was seen in the devastations which it committed in the city, when,
in 1842, the Cape was laid in ruins by an earthquake, and one half
of its inhabitants were destroyed. The population of the country
rushed into the town, and spent a fortnight in pillage and plunder;
saying to the ruined proprietors: “It is the good God that gives
us this; yesterday was your day; to-day is ours.” The opposition
made its appearance in the legislative hall. It was driven thence
by the force of <hi rend="italics">coups-d'état.</hi> It revived in the country in the
form of conspiracy. The conspirators gathered around an 
ambitious man of small ability, Hérard-Rivière, a commander of
artillery, who was put forward by an ambitious man of talent,
Hérard-Dumesle. A manifesto was sent forth, in which 
Hérard-Rivière was placed at the head of the executive government.
Fighting ensued. Boyer, in disgust, quitted the island (13th
March, 1843), and embarked for Jamaica, after taking leave of
the inhabitants in language which did not want dignity.</p>
            <p>After the departure of President Boyer, various pretenders to
the supreme authority came forward, and for a time disorders
more or less prevailed. These disorders were not wholly without
advantage. Around Guerrier gathered sympathies in favour of
national unity; Accaan united men in a common effort of defence;
and Pierrot strengthened the feeling of a common need of conciliation 
and regard to law. Hence an important fact came into
view, namely that the moral, economical, and political fusion of
the two colours was not only not impossible but in part
accomplished. The great question now was to find a man capable
of developing the consequences of this new state of things, a man
who should unite in his policy the good qualities of the system
of Christophe with that of Pétion and Boyer, and who, energetic
like the former, should be humane, liberal, and civilizing, like the
two latter. The national sentiment looked to General Riché and
made no mistake. Uniting to the ascendancy which he derived
<pb id="beard315" n="315"/>
from his skin,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref21" n="21" rend="sc" target="note21">*</ref>
<note id="note21" n="21" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref21">* Riché was what is called a griffe—that is, though he had white blood in his 
veins, he was, in appearance, in no way distinguished from a black.</note> the intelligence and almost the instruction of the
mulatto chiefs, Riché for a moment realized the ideal of a Haytian
government. He repressed the barbarous element without 
at the same time crushing the element of culture, and he had 
both the power and the will, to open the country to foreign capital, 
and to organize native labour. He had done little more than
enter on these important improvements, when he was carried off 
by a sudden malady, universally regretted, two days previous to
the first anniversary of his elevation. Public opinion designated 
as his successor the black Generals Paul and Souffrant, who 
appeared equally desirous and equally able to continue the policy 
of Riché. The Senate, whose duty it was to elect the president, 
was divided between the two competitors, when a third 
candidate was proposed, who was elected on the very ground that 
as no one thought of him, no one offered him opposition. On 
the 1st of March, 1847, General Faustin Soulouque, the present 
ruler of Hayti, was appointed its president.</p>
            <p>Soulouque was a large, good-natured negro, who, from the 
year 1804, when he was the house-servant of General Lamarre, 
had passed through all the events of his country without leaving 
any trace of himself whether good or bad. In 1810 Lamarre was 
killed, while defending the Môle against Christophe, and Soulouque, 
who had become his master's aide-de-camp, was charged to carry 
his heart to Pétion. The latter made him lieutenant in his 
mounted guard, and bequeathed him afterwards to Boyer, as a 
piece of furniture belonging to the presidential palace. In his 
turn Boyer appointed him captain, and attached him in particular 
to the service of Mademoiselle Joute, who had been the lady 
president of two successive presidents. From that time until 1843, 
Soulouque had remained completely forgotten; thenceforward 
every change made him more prominent. Under Hérard he 
became a chief of squadron, under Guerrier, a colonel, and under 
Riché, a general and superior commander of the palace guard. The 
new president was, at his election, two-and-sixty years old, though 
he did not seem to be more than forty. The negro peculiarities of
<pb id="beard316" n="316"/>
feature appear in him in a subdued form. His eyes have a mild
aspect. The general expression of his countenance is placid.
He manifested singular timidity when he entered on his dignified
office, and really possessed a modesty which subsequent events
have done much to wear away. In Soulouque the inferior element
of Haytian life has its representative and its encouragement.
Grossly ignorant, he is also absurdly superstitious. His vanity
exceeds all bounds, and led him in the year 1849 to assume the
title of Emperor. In this silly step he took for his model 
Napoleon Bonaparte, according to whose court and camp Soulouque
formed his own. The details are too trivial to deserve enumeration. 
Only let not the folly be imputed to the hue of Soulouque's
skin. If Hayti has its emperor, that sovereign borrowed the idea
from France.</p>

          <div3 type="chapter">
            <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
            <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>My narrative has come to a close. In looking back on the series
of events of which I have spoken, I am impressed with the necessity 
of guarding against two extremes. Of these, the one degrades
the African to the level of the brute; the other sets him on an
equality with the Caucasian. The negro is a man; equally is it
true that the negro race is inferior to the highest style of man.
Individuals belonging to that race have risen very high in the
scale of civilized life. Toussaint L'Ouverture commands our respect
and admiration. But the race at large cannot be accounted equal
to some others, if only because as yet it has no history. Qualities
there are in the negro blood of a very valuable nature. 
Peculiarly is it favourable to the development of the domestic 
affections. It involves a strong attachment to place as well as kindred.
But the very excess of its emotional nature unfits it for elevated
thought, continuous industry, and lofty achievement. It is no
disparagement to the Africans to say that they have realized but
<pb id="beard317" n="317"/>
a small amount of social good in the Island of Hayti, since the
outbreak of its insurrectionary movements. With its legacy of
slavery degradations, envenomed prejudices, conflicting interests,
and sanguinary wars, the island, within the last seventy years, has
had a most rugged and perilous path to tread, in which it may
be safely affirmed, the most cultivated of European nations would
have experienced great difficulty to hold itself erect. And after
what, in this old world of ours, we witnessed in the year 1848,
we surely have no right to be severe in our judgment, even of the
Emperor Soulouque. There is, however, in the preceding history
—in the patriotism of Toussaint, in the firmness of Christophe,
in the moderation of Boyer, and in the wisdom of Riché, with the
good results of which those eminent rulers were severally and
unitedly the authors,—there is enough to assure the impartial, that
in dark-coloured blood there is no incapacity for either government 
or social and civilized life, and to inspire and warrant the
hope, that Hayti will gradually, if slowly, rise to take a position
among the first nations of the earth.</p>
            <p>Before the sixteenth century, the African races were little
known in the Christian world. Since then they have been brought
into close contact with white men. A fusion has ensued. That
fusion in Hayti has gone far to render pure African blood 
somewhat rare. A similar result is rapidly taking place in the United
States. In this intermingling of two diverse streams, Providence
seems to intend the improvement of both. The union involves
the personal freedom and the social elevation of the blacks. It
will also in time issue in a higher moral culture on the part of
the whites. We shall learn to do justly by the weak; they will
be aided to rise out of an existence little more than sensuous;
while, in cases in which the two streams flow together in the
same veins, the black may obtain nerve and hardihood, and the
white may be enriched and mellowed.</p>
            <p>Between two parties who may thus confer benefits on each
other, there is no reason, and ought to be no room, for 
prejudice and misunderstanding. Children of the same great and
good Parent, and objects of the same redeeming love, they have
each a work on earth to perform, they have each a mind to 
<pb id="beard318" n="318"/>
cultivate and a soul to save, and can gain the approbation of their
Creator and their Saviour, only so far as they interchange succour
and promote common good, and aid and forward the grand drama
of human life.</p>
            <p>Persons who view great social questions in their bearing on
material interests, will be disposed to inquire what has been the
result of emancipation in Hayti on the products and commerce
of the island. Statistical evidence shows a considerable diminution. 
If that diminution is real, it is the measure of relief from
labour which his freedom has brought to the slave; it is more—
it is the measure of his lessened punishments and his lessened
sufferings. And if the negro can with little labour supply all the
wants of which he is sensible, who has a right to augment his toil
by compulsion? If our stock of sugar is less, it is an ample
compensation to feel that the amount of human happiness is
more; and if the negro is content, let us show our dissatisfaction,
not by coercing him, but by raising him by gentle, persuasive,
and attractive means to feel and acknowledge other and higher
wants; and then, of his own accord, he will impose on himself
additional labour. Should he, however, continue to prefer his
native banian, with case and repose, to our beef, purchasable only
by long and severe toil, I see no ground whatever on which we
may justifiably interfere with his mode of life, still less why we
are at liberty to compel him to toil for our pleasure or our
advantage.</p>

          <head>ON THE COLOURED POPULATION.</head>
          <p>Coloured population means sometimes the collective mass of blacks and of
coloured men; but we more frequently understand by the words, <hi rend="italics">coloured
population, coloured caste, coloured people, coloured men,</hi> those who are
neither black nor white; we also give them the general denomination of <hi rend="italics">the
mixed races.</hi></p>
          <p>The collective or particular acceptation of coloured population derives its
signification from the phrase in which it is used.</p>
          <p>M. Moreau de Saint-Méry, in developing the system of Franklin, has
classed under general heads the different shades which the mixed population
of colour present.</p>
          <p>He supposes that man altogether forms 128 shades, which are white
among the whites, and black among the blacks.</p>
          <p>Setting out from this principle, he proves that we are so much nearer to or
farther from the one colour or the other, as we either approach or remove
from the number 64, which is their middle term.</p>
          <p>According to this system, every man who has not eight shades of white, is
considered black.</p>
          <p>Proceeding from this colour towards white, we distinguish nine principal
stocks, which have again varieties among them, according as they retain
more or less shades of the one colour or of the other.</p>

            <p>According to the aforesaid system, whoever reaches the 8th degree, finds
that he has 8191 white parts to one black part, which is really no difference,

          <p>“The planters took the initiative in the revolution. Not less devoid of
foresight than the aristocracy of the mother country, they warmly accepted
and patronised the ideas which gave birth to 1789. The enfeeblement of
the monarchical authority, was for them the relaxation of a system which
excluded them from the high colonial positions, and forced their pride and
their habitual despotism to bend before the discretionary power of the agents
of the mother country. Civic equality was the complete assimilation of the
colony to France, the free exercise of the means of action which their
immense riches seemed to secure them. Without waiting for the authority
of the government, the colonists formed themselves into parochial and 
<pb id="beard325" n="325"/>
provincial assemblies, and sent to Paris eighteen deputies, who were admitted
some as of right, the others as petitioners. Much excited by this first success,
these pretensions to political and administrative equality were soon, in the
colonial aristocracy, transformed into an avowed wish for independence. The
provincial assemblies delegated the direction of the interior affairs of the
colony to a sort of convention, which met at Saint Marc, and that convention,
in which the influence of the planters predominated, declared that they were
constituted in virtue of the powers of <hi rend="italics">their constituents,</hi> contrary to the
opinion of the minority, who proposed to say, “In virtue of the decrees of
the mother country.”</p>
          <p>But by the side of the colonial aristocracy were the whites of the inferior
and the middle class, who in ardently adhering to the revolutionary doctrines
which they had fomented, intended to deduce therefrom all their logical
consequences. Offended at the disdain of the planters, those two classes
hailed in the new ideas the coming of civil and social equality. Between
the feudal oligarchy which the planters saw in their dreams of independence,
and a share in the conquests already realized by the liberalism of the mother
country, those classes could not hesitate, and gave themselves wholly to
France. The provincial assembly of the north, almost entirely composed of
lawyers whom the convention of Saint Marc had alienated by certain regulations 
tending to lessen their fees, gave the official signal of the reaction.
Forthwith the planters changed their tactics. They pretended to renounce
their projects of independence, armed themselves against the authority of the
mother country with demagogical ideas, and thus succeeded in acquiring a
numerous party in the dregs of the white population; but Peinier, the
governor, supported by the sound part, of the colonial <foreign lang="fre">tiers-état,</foreign> broke up
and dismissed the insurrectionary assembly of Saint Marc.</p>
          <p>A third element appeared on the scene, and took in regard to the whole
white population the part which the <foreign lang="fre">tiers-état</foreign> (the people) had in regard to
the planters. While the colonists were disputing respecting liberty and
equality, the freed-men had not kept their ears closed. More than others
they had a right to see a benefit in the revolution; for by the fact that their
colour (two thirds of them were of mixed blood), their education, their quality
of free-men and of proprietors, brought them into proximity to the white
caste, it was for them specially that the dark susceptibility of colonial 
prejudice took pleasure in making the demarcation harsh and offensive. The
decree of the 8th of March, conferred on them indeed political rights; but
that decree raised in all the ranks of the white population such a condemnation 
that the governor himself concurred in preventing its execution. In
vain the freed-men took up arms in favour of the mother country in the
struggle sustained by the governor against the colonial aristocracy. After
the victory the governor showed the freed-men no favour for their efforts,
and carried disdain so far as not to allow them to wear the white cockade,
which distinguished the royalist party. The mulattoes abandoned that
party; and a new decree, by which the constituent assembly retracted the
decree of the 8th of March, completed the rupture. Then came a third
decree, which restored their political rights to the freed-men, and that 
occasioned fresh resistance on the part of the whites. The demagogical party
revolted against the government; the aristocratical party, or those who were
<pb id="beard326" n="326"/>
for independence, offered the colony to England; the royalist party, quite as
hostile to the mulattoes as the two others, found nothing better to hold the
planters in respect than to covertly arouse the blacks; and the mulattoes,
who on their side had made a new armed attempt to support their rights
against the white caste, gained all the advantage of this intervention of the
blacks, among whom they even made numerous recruits. In the midst of
the intricacies of the contests which ensued, one fact is of special consequence:
feeling that their only point of support was in the mother country, the new
citizens (the freed-men) had the tact or the good faith to remain faithful to
her. There thus came a time when they became for the commissioners
charged with the pacification of the island, that which the white <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fre">tiers-état</foreign></hi>
had been for Governor Peinier, namely, the only colonial auxiliaries under
French influence, so that the final triumph of the authority of the mother
country had for a necessary result the preponderance of the men of colour.”</p>

          <head>NOTE C.</head>
          <p>The following is the view taken of the struggle for negro freedom by
CHRISTOPHE, who was himself concerned therein; the passage is taken from
a manifesto, published in 1814, by that warrior, then King of Hayti, and
threatened with a new invasion by the whites.</p>
          <p>“We have deserved the favours of liberty, by our indissoluble attachment
to the mother country. We have proved to her our gratitude.</p>
          <p>“At the time when, reduced to our own private resources, cut off from all
communication with France, we resisted every allurement; when, inflexible
to menaces, deaf to proposals, inaccessible to artifice, we braved misery,
famine, and privation of every kind, and finally triumphed over our enemies
both within and without.</p>
          <p>“We were then far from perceiving that twelve years after, as the price
of so much perseverance, sacrifice, and blood, France would deprive us in a
most barbarous manner of the most precious of our possessions—liberty.</p>
          <p>“Under the administration of Governor-General Toussaint L'Ouverture,
Hayti arose from her ruins, and every thing seemed to promise a happy
future. The arrival of General Hedouville completely changed the aspect of
affairs, and struck a deadly blow to public tranquillity. We will not enter
into the detail of his intrigues with the Haytian General Rigaud, whom he
persuaded to revolt against his legitimate chief. We will only say, that
before leaving the island Hedouville had put every thing into confusion, by
casting among us the firebrands of discord, and lighting the torch of civil
war.</p>
          <p>“Ever zealous for the re-establishment of order and of peace, Toussaint-L'Ouverture, 
by a paternal government, restored their original energy to law,
morality, religion, education, and industry. Agriculture and commerce were
flourishing; he was favourable to white colonists, especially to those who
occupied new possessions; and the care and partiality which he felt for them
<pb id="beard327" n="327"/>
went so far, that he was severely censured as being more attached to them
than to people of his own colour. This negro wail was not without reason;
for some months previous to the arrival of the French, he put to death his
own nephew, General Moise, for having disregarded his orders relative to
the protection of the colonists. This act of the governor, and the great
confidence which he had in the French government, were the chief causes of
the weak resistance which the French met with in Hayti. In reality, his
confidence in that government was so great, that the general had disbanded
the greater part of the regular troops, and employed them in the cultivation
of the ground.</p>
          <p>“Such was the state of affairs whilst the peace of Amiens was being
negotiated: it was scarcely concluded when a powerful armament landed
on our coasts a large army, which, attacking us by surprise, when we
thought ourselves perfectly secure, plunged us suddenly into an abyss of
evils.</p>
          <p>“Posterity will find a difficulty in believing that, in so enlightened and
philosophic an age, such an abominable enterprise could possibly have been
conceived. In the midst of a civilized people, a horde of barbarians 
suddenly set out with the design of exterminating an innocent and peaceable
nation, or at least of loading them anew with the chains of national slavery.</p>
          <p>“It was not enough that they employed violence; they also thought it
necessary to use perfidy and villany,—they were compelled to sow dissension
among us. Every means was put in requisition to carry out this abominable
scheme. The leaders of all political parties in France, even the sons of the
governor Toussaint, were invited to take part in the expedition. They, as
well as ourselves, were deceived by that chef-d'œuvre of perfidy, the 
proclamation of the first consul, in which he said to us, ‘You are all equal and
free before God and the republic;‘ such was his declaration, at the same
time that his private instructions to General Leclerc were to re-establish
slavery.</p>
          <p>“The greater part of the population, deceived by these fallacious promises,
and for a long time accustomed to consider itself as French, submitted 
without resistance. The governor so little expected the appearance of an enemy,
that he had not even ordered his generals to resist in case of an attack
being made; and when the armament arrived, he himself was on a journey
towards the eastern coast. If some few generals did resist, it was owing
only to the hostile and menacing manner in which they were summoned to
surrender, which compelled them to respect their duty, their honour, and the
present circumstances.</p>
          <p>“After a resistance of some months, the governor-general yielded to the
pressing entreaties and the solemn protestations of Leclerc, ‘that he intended
to protect the liberties of every one, and that France would never destroy
so noble a work.’ On this footing, peace was negotiated with France; and
the governor Toussaint, laying aside his power, peaceably retired to the
retreat he had prepared for himself.</p>
          <p>“Scarcely had the French extended their dominion over the whole island,
and that more by roguery and deceit than by force of arms, than they
began to put in execution their horrible system of slavery and destruction.</p>
          <p>“To hasten the accomplishment of their projects, mercenary and 
<pb id="beard328" n="328"/>
Machiavellian writers fabricated fictitious narratives, and attributed to Toussaint
designs that he had never entertained. While he was remaining peaceably
at home, on the faith of solemn treaties, he was seized, loaded with irons,
dragged away with the whole of his family, and transported to France. The
whole of Europe knows how he ended his unfortunate career, in torture and
in prayer, in the dungeon of the Château de Joux.</p>
          <p>“Such was the recompence reserved for his attachment to France, and for
the eminent services he had rendered to the colony.</p>
          <p>“At the same time, notice was given to arrest all suspected persons
throughout the island. All those who had shown brave and enlightened
souls, when we claimed for ourselves the rights of men, were the first to be
seized. Even the traitors who had most contributed to the success of the
French army, by serving as guides to their advanced guard, and by exciting
their compatriots to take vengeance, were not spared. At first they desired
to sell them into strange colonies; but as this plait did not succeed, they
resolved to transport them to France, where overpowering labour, the galleys,
chains, and prisons, were awaiting them.</p>
          <p>“Then the white colonists, whose numbers have continually increased,
seeing their power sufficiently established, discarded the mask of dissimulation,
openly declared the re-establishment of slavery, and acted in accordance
with their declaration. They had the impudence to claim as their slaves, men
who had made themselves eminent by the most brilliant services to their
country, in both the civil and military departments. Virtuous and honourable 
magistrates, warriors covered with wounds, whose blood had been
poured out for France and for liberty, were compelled to fall back into the
bonds of slavery. These colonists, scarcely established in the possession of
their land, whose power was liable to be overthrown by the slightest cause,
already marked out and chose in the distance those whom they determined
should be the first victims of their vengeance.</p>
          <p>“The proud and liberty-hating faction of the colonists, of those traffickers
in human flesh, who, since the commencement of the revolution, had not
ceased to impregnate the successive governments in France with their plans,
their projects, their atrocious and extravagant memorials, and everything
tending to our ruin,—these factious men, tormented by the recollection of
the despotism which they had formerly exercised at Hayti, a prey to their
low and cruel passions, exerted all their efforts to repossess themselves of the
prey which had escaped from their clutches. In favour of independence
under the constitutional assembly, terrorists under the Jacobins, and, finally,
zealous Bonapartists, they knew how to assume the mask of any party, in
order to obtain place and favour. It was thus by their insidious counsels
they urged Bonaparte to undertake this iniquitous expedition to Hayti. It
was this faction who, after having advised the expedition, furnished the
pecuniary resources which were necessary, by means of subscriptions which
were at this time commenced. In a word, it was this faction which caused
the blood of our compatriots to flow in torrents,—which invented the
exhausting tortures to which we were subjected; it is to these colonists that
France owes the loss of a powerful army, which perished in the plains and
marshes of Hayti; it is to them that she owes the shame of an enterprise
which has fixed an indelible stain on the French name.</p>
          <pb id="beard329" n="329"/>
          <p>“Immediately, the greater part of the people took up arms for the 
preservation of life and liberty. Even this first movement alarmed the French,
and appeared to General Leclerc so important as to cause him to summon a
special meeting of the colonists, in order to adopt measures suitable to bring
about a better state of affairs; but these colonists, far from desisting from
their atrocious principles, notwithstanding the imminence of the danger,
unanimously exclaimed, ‘If there is no slavery, there is no colony!’</p>
          <p>“Members of the council, it was in vain that we raised our voices to
prevent the total ruin of our country; in vain we represented to them the
horrible injustice of again casting so many free men into slavery; in vain
(for we knew the spirit of liberty which animated our compatriots) we
denounced this measure as the certain ruin of the country, and that it would
detach it for ever from France: it was all in vain. Convinced that there
no longer remained any hope of conciliation, and that we were compelled to
choose between slavery and death, then, with our weapons in our hands, we
undeceived our compatriots, whose whole attention was directed towards us,
and we unanimously seized our swords, resolved either to drive those tyrants
from the land for ever, or to die.</p>
          <p>“General Leclerc had already announced the conquest of the island, and
had received from almost all the maritime towns of France (where resided
the chief advocates of slavery), letters of congratulation on his pretended
conquest. Ashamed of having given rise to such deceitful hopes, mortified
at not being able to achieve the detestable enterprise, and mistrusting the
approach of another terrible war, despair shortened his days and dragged
him down to the grave.</p>
          <p>“Amid this long tissue of crimes which marked the administration of
General Leclerc, we will merely point out his conduct towards the Haytian
general, Maurepas, which could not but excite the commiseration even of
the most cold-hearted. Maurepas, a man of gentle and agreeable manners,
esteemed by his fellow-citizens for his integrity, was one of the first to join
the French, and rendered them the most signal services. Nevertheless, he
was suddenly carried off to Port-au-Prince, and taken on board the admiral's
vessel, which was then at anchor near the Cape coasts; and then, having
been bound to the mainmast, in mockery they put two epaulettes on his
shoulders, fastened them on by nails such as they use in naval carpentry,
and covered his head with a general's hat. In this frightful condition,
these savages, after having given free vent to their ferocious joy, precipitated
him, with his wife and children, into the sea. Such was the destiny of
this virtuous though unfortunate soldier.”—<foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">Histoire de l'Ile d'Hayti,</hi> par</foreign>

          <p>The efforts made by Christophe for the instruction of the people are
described in the following passages, which are laid before the reader, the
<pb id="beard330" n="330"/>
rather because they afford encouragement to those who may be desirous
to aid in raising Hayti to its proper condition:—</p>
          <p>“He (Christophe) had already learnt, by means of his correspondence
with some English gentlemen, that the Lancasterian system, being singularly
adapted to the education of youth in the rudiments of knowledge, had been
acted on with great success in this country;—he also knew that a society
had been formed for the purpose of establishing schools on this system, and
for preparing young men to superintend them, and it was further stated, that
if he was desirous of introducing it into Hayti, that society would readily
furnish him with schoolmasters duly qualified for the work. In consequence
of this information, he caused an application to be made to the British and
Foreign School Society for such a number of instructors as was thought
necessary to commence the undertaking; and all matters relating to their
salaries and other expenses being arranged, six teachers, who had been
previously engaged in superintending schools in England, sailed for Hayti.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref22" n="22" rend="sc" target="note22">*</ref></p>
          <note id="note22" n="22" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref22">* Soon after the schools were established in Hayti, and the utility of the
system began to appear, Christophe presented this society with one hundred
guineas.</note>
          <p>“On their arrival at Cap François, which was in 1816, Christophe afforded
them every possible facility, and at the same time exempted them from the
disagreeable regulations to which the other white residents were subject.
Thus encouraged, they proceeded in the prosecution of their object with
great diligence and application. Buildings were prepared under their inspection;
books, and every other necessary apparatus, were provided; and in a
short time, schools were established at Cap François, St. Mare's, Gonaives,
and other towns, containing nearly 2,000 pupils. In these schools, the Haytian
youth were taught reading, writing, the elements of arithmetic, and English;
and after they had made considerable progress in the latter, the business of
the school was conducted in that language. The object of this regulation,
it was stated, was to introduce English into general use; for so thoroughly
did Christophe detest the French, that he was anxious to abolish 
everything that indicated their former possession of the island; to accomplish
which, he was determined to leave no means untried.</p>
          <p>Among the first things which I visited, after my arrival in Hayti, was
the school established at Cap François. The place appropriated to this
purpose was a large building, situated in a retired and elevated part of the
town, and was as properly arranged and as perfectly furnished with all the
necessary apparatus, as the best schools conducted on this system are 
prepared in England. This school contained from one hundred and fifty to
two hundred boys, from eight to sixteen years of age. When I entered the
room, they were regularly divided into their classes, all busily engaged at
their lessons; and their evident attention and application could not fail to
strike a visitor. The sight of so many young negroes, employed in acquiring
the rudiments of learning, would have been, to any one, as interesting as it
was novel; to those who feel a just concern in the welfare of the African
race, it was peculiarly so; nor was it possible to witness it, without 
recollecting how different would have been their condition had they been
enslaved, and rejoicing at the change which had led to such beneficial
results.</p>
          <pb id="beard331" n="331"/>
          <p>“The master of this school, who was an intelligent young man, had 
conducted it from its commencement, and his ability and attention appeared
from the perfect order which prevailed throughout. My inquiries of him
respecting those placed under his instruction related to the following 
particulars:—Whether they displayed common aptness for learning; whether
they readily remembered what they acquired; and whether they were
capable of the application expected from boys in general of their age? To
these questions he replied, that among so great a number as were 
committed to his care, there were, of course, several whose incapacity prevented
them from making any great progress, but that the majority learnt without
much difficulty, and many even with considerable facility; that with regard
to their memory, their gradual advancement from one branch to another,
and their readiness in recollecting small pieces of poetry or prose, which they
were occasionally required to learn, were satisfactory proofs of its being 
sufficiently retentive; and at the same time adding, that they required no more
powerful stimulus to application and diligence than is necessary for youth in
general.</p>
          <p>“In answer to a question respecting the general character of his pupils, he
further stated that they were far less obstinate and refractory than he had
expected to find them. The facility, he said, with which they became
familiarized to the mechanical part of the system, was surprising; the
necessity of inflicting severe punishment, he stated, was not frequent; if a
few were disobedient and inattentive, he observed, others were no less diligent
and submissive; and pointing to the state of the school at that moment, he
hoped, he said, its order and regularity were indications of its flourishing
condition, as well as of the docility and submission of the boys.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref23" n="23" rend="sc" target="note23">*</ref><note id="note23" n="23" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref23">* Since my return to England, I have visited the central school of the British
and Foreign School Society, in the Borough-road, London; and granting, as
every one must, that it is conducted with admirable order, yet I confess I could
not perceive its superiority, in point of general discipline, to that consisting of
the Haytian youth at Cap François.</note> He 
concluded his answers by assuring me that, on the whole, he found the young
negroes and mulattoes as apt to learn and as ready to remember as he had
found the youth of our own country.</p>
          <p>“At this period, all the boys of the school could read and write; many of
them were acquainted with the introductory rules of arithmetic; and some
spoke the English language with considerable ease and propriety. At the
request of the master, I called several of his pupils indiscriminately, and
proposed to them questions, according to the classes in which they stood;
and the result of this examination was a conviction that, whatever may be
affirmed of the stupidity of the negro, he is no further inferior in intellect to
others than the system of slavery renders him. Of this I received a further
confirmation by subsequent trials. I directed a certain number of these
lads to commit to memory select pieces of English and French, some in
poetry and others in prose; and promised to encourage them by bestowing
appropriate rewards on those who should repeat these pieces most readily
and correctly. At the expiration of the time appointed them for learning,
they each recited their respective portions with so much ease and propriety,
<pb id="beard332" n="332"/>
that it was difficult to determine to whom the prizes should be adjudged,
and the only satisfactory mode of arrangement appeared to be that of 
increasing the number, so as to give to each boy a trifling reward. A short
time afterwards, I heard them repeat the same pieces, and they rehearsed
them with nearly the same readiness and correctness as they had previously
done.</p>
          <p>“One of the elder boys of this school was particularly pointed out, as 
distinguished from his schoolfellows by his great aptness for learning, and for
the progress he had made in some branches not usually included in the
Lancasterian system of education. He was an interesting looking lad, about
sixteen years of age, and occasionally undertook, in the absence of the master,
the superintendence of the school. Being desirous of ascertaining the extent
of his acquirements, I requested him to call at my lodgings for the purpose
of examining him. On his compliance with this request, I first proposed to
him a few questions in the Single Rule of Three: these he answered with
perfect ease. I then proposed others in the different cases of Practice: these
also he performed with equal facility. After this I tried him in the simple
and compound rules of Vulgar and Decimal Fractions, and found him no less
familiar with them; but the Square Root somewhat puzzled him, and in the
Cube Root, he felt totally unable to proceed. His next trial was to 
translate a paragraph from one of the pieces in Enfield's Speaker into French,
which he did without much difficulty, and, as far as I was qualified to judge,
with a great degree of accuracy. He was then requested to give in writing
a translation of a page of Bossuet's ‘<foreign lang="fre">Histoire Universelle</foreign>’ into English,
and was furnished with a dictionary for his assistance. About this part of
his examination, he employed considerable time, and appeared to bestow on
it special attention and care; he repeatedly corrected his translation, copied
it several times before he appeared satisfied, and even then hesitated to hand
it to me. But when completed, it far exceeded my expectations; for though
it contained one or two Gallicisms, in point of sense and grammatical 
construction, it was remarkably correct. Finally, he pointed out, on a map, the
boundaries of the four quarters of the globe, the situation of his own country,
with its latitude and longitude, the limits of the European nations, with their
capitals, the principal islands of both hemispheres, and the more remarkable
mountains, gulfs, and lakes, with a readiness as surprising as it was 
satisfactory; at the same time answering the questions proposed to him respecting
the religious and peculiar manners and customs of different nations with
like facility and accuracy. During the whole time his manners were 
perfectly unassuming; it was also evident that he had been especially assisted
and encouraged, and that his progress was proportionably rapid and sure;
and I confess that the result of this examination afforded me as much
gratification as any circumstance I witnessed during my stay in the island.</p>
          <p>“While the school at Cap François was in this flourishing condition, and
presented such satisfactory proofs of the capacity and application of the
Haytian youth, those established at Gonaïves, St. Marc's, Fort Royal, and
at other places, were, I understood, (for I had not an opportunity of visiting
them,) in a state equally encouraging and prosperous. The young negroes
admitted into them were stated to have exhibited similar proofs of their
possessing a ready apprehension and a retentive memory; and while, by their
<pb id="beard333" n="333"/>
progress, they afforded the utmost satisfaction to their teachers, their facility
of acquirement rendered the labour of instruction far less difficult and tedious
than had been anticipated.</p>
          <p>“In the meantime, a ‘Royal Board of Public Instruction,’ had been
established, for the purpose of superintending the education of youth, and
of extending the present system, whenever it should become necessary. It
consisted of two dukes, five counts, and four barons, some of the most 
intelligent and active of Christophe's adherents, and therefore the best 
qualified to undertake the duties which their situation involved.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref24" n="24" rend="sc" target="note24">*</ref><note id="note24" n="24" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref24">* De Limonade and Dupuy were of the number.</note> In the
first account of their proceedings, published in the Haytian Gazette, they
declare it as their belief that ‘Instruction, when founded on the true 
principles of liberty, religion, and morals, is one of the most fruitful sources
of public prosperity, and essentially contributes to the good order of society,
and obedience to the laws.’ And in conformity with these views, they express
their resolution ‘to give regular organziation to this important branch of
the administration, and to establish suitable regulations for its superintendence.’</p>
          <p>“The more especial objects of this Board were, to provide that ‘education
be founded on good principles,—viz., those of religion, respect for the laws,
and love to the sovereign; to confirm the regulations already ordained for
this purpose, and to appoint such others as should be deemed expedient; to
maintain order, discipline, and the observance of the rules, in the national 
establishments for public instruction already existing; and to found new schools,
and colleges, or academies, whenever it should appear necessary.’ To facilitate
the accomplishment of these objects, ‘three inspectors were nominated for
each establishment, chosen from among the respectable residents of the
neighbourhood where it was situated; whose business it was to visit the
places of instruction, and to correspond with the Board on all things
relating to their appointment. In addition to which, one of its own 
members was selected to make similar visits, at stated periods, and to render an
account of the state of the schools, and of the progress of education, as
reported by the inspectors and masters.’ In pursuance of the same objects,
it was further determined that the Board should, every six months, present
to the king a report of the progress of public instruction, with the names of
the masters most distinguished for their attention and care; and that, more
especially, to encourage the students of the different establishments, annual
prizes, granted by his majesty, should be awarded to those who, by their
diligent and successful application, should merit particular distinction.</p>
          <p>“Conformably with the general design of the ‘Royal Board,’ when the
schools had been some time in operation, and the elder boys had acquired the
rudiments of knowledge, it was resolved that another establishment should
be founded for their further instruction, denominated the Royal College; an
appellation, perhaps, somewhat misapplied, the institution being similar to the
grammar schools, or to the more respectable academies in England. Cap
François was fixed on for its situation, that place being the capital of the
kingdom, and possessing greater advantages than any other. While a suitable
building was preparing for the purpose, a proposal was made to two English
<pb id="beard334" n="334"/>
gentlemen, through the same medium by which the Lancasterian 
schoolmasters had been procured, inviting them to Hayti, to superintend the 
institution, and offering them a liberal remuneration for their services, which
proposal was accepted. The students were then selected from among the
more meritorious of those who had previously distinguished themselves by
their conduct and acquirements; and thus the college (if such it must be
called) was established, without either difficulty or delay.</p>
          <p>“A considerable number of the Haytian youth were now instructed in Latin,
English, and French composition, history, geography, and mathematics, and
were assisted in these pursuits by tutors whose attainments fully qualified
them to direct their studies. The classical professor, on whom at first
devolved the entire charge of the college, devoted himself to a task at once
laborious and irksome, with the utmost zeal and diligence. He strove to
simplify his instructions, so as to render them intelligible to the slowest
understanding; he varied his method of teaching according to the different
capacities of his pupils; he assisted them in their difficulties, and encouraged
them by his mildness and persuasions; and being a clergyman of the Anglican
church, he added to his usual engagements that of occasionally instructing
them in the doctrines and precepts of the Christian religion. Nor was the
mathematical professor less indefatigable in his endeavours to promote the
improvement of those committed to his charge. He was a gentleman of
considerable scientific attainments, highly respected by Christophe and the
Board of Instruction for his superior qualifications, and esteemed for his
amiable disposition and obliging deportment by all who had the happiness of
his acquaintance. Though unaccustomed to the education of youth previously
to his arrival in Hayti, his intimate knowledge of mathematics, accompanied
by a correct judgment, enabled him to adopt a method of instructing his
pupils perfectly adapted to their abilities and attainments; and while he 
endeavoured to initiate them into the elements of science, he was not forgetful
to encourage them by the most powerful motives. Desirous at the same
time of employing his leisure hours in the promotion of some useful object,
he occasionally delivered lectures on mechanics and chemistry; and being
provided with the apparatus necessary for the purpose, he illustrated their
principles by suitable experiments.</p>
          <p>“Under the tuition of these instructors, the students made considerable
advances in those branches of learning to which the attention was now
directed. The majority were able, in a short time, to construe the more
easy Latin authors without much difficulty; they wrote English and French
with ease and correctness; and they especially delighted in the study of
history and geography, and regarded it rather as a recreation than as a
task. The mathematics alone they found so difficult as to require every
possible encouragement to induce them to proceed. But if they made
slower progress in this than in other pursuits, it arose more from the
peculiar application it requires, than from any defect in their mental
powers. They possessed, it was evident, the ability to learn; but had not
always resolution to persevere in a study so dry and abstract, and, to those
who have not a genius peculiarly adapted to it, so utterly uninviting. Yet a
few, who were distinguished from the rest more for their patient application
than for greater quickness of parts or strength of memory, steadily 
<pb id="beard335" n="335"/>
persevered; and having overcome the first difficulties, which to their 
fellow-students had appeared insurmountable, they afterwards advanced with
considerable ease; and at length became as familiar with the elements of
geometry and algebra as they were with their previous acquirements.</p>
          <p>“Among other circumstances connected with their progress in this branch
of learning, the following may not be uninteresting. During the period
that the late Sir Home Popham was appointed to the Jamaica station, he
paid occasional visits to Cap François. On the last of these visits to that place,
whilst on his return to England, he made particular inquiries respecting the
college, and went, in company with Baron de Dupuy, to see it. He was
exceedingly pleased on entering, at observing the order and regularity with
which it was conducted; and was still more gratified by the evident 
progress of the students. Being informed by Dupuy that, among other things,
the mathematics also were taught, he was curious enough to try the 
proficiency of the class, by pointing out some geometrical propositions for them
to demonstrate. They readily constructed the diagrams, and gave the
demonstrations with correctness and facility; and the admiral appeared
singularly gratified with this unexpected proof of the ability and acquirements
of negroes.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref25" n="25" rend="sc" target="note25">*</ref></p>
