        <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
        <p>WITHIN the last four years, many hundreds, probably thousands,
of persons in our nominally free States,
have seen Peter Still, a neat, staid black man, going
from city to city, town to town, house to house, asking
assistance to enable him to purchase the freedom of his
wife and children. He has always been grateful for the
smallest favors, and never morose when utterly denied.
He has not obtruded himself or his story; but those
who have shown curiosity enough to make any inquiries,
have been soon led to suspect that he was no
common man; that the events of his life had been
thrillingly interesting—some of them even more wonderful
than we often meet with in works of fiction.
Kidnapped, in his early childhood, from the door-step
<pb id="pickardxviii" n="xviii"/>
of his home in New Jersey; more than forty years a
slave in Kentucky and Alabama; his unsuccessful appeal
to the great Henry Clay; his liberation through
the generosity of a Jew; his restoration to his mother
by the guidance of the slightest threads of memory;
the yearning of his heart for his loved ones; the
heroic but disastrous attempt of Concklin to bring his
wife and children to him—wherever these incidents
of his life were detailed, they seldom failed to draw
from the hand of the listener some contribution towards
the exorbitant sum demanded for the liberation
of his family.</p>
        <p>Words of discouragement, even from his warmest
friends, fell without weight on the heart of Peter Still.
Arguments, sometimes urged against the propriety of
paying, especially an exorbitant price, for liberty,
were parried by him with a skill not to be acquired in
“The Schools.” His soul was intent upon a great
purpose. He could not be withheld; he could not be
turned aside. His perseverance, his patience, his exactness,
his tact, everywhere attracted attention, and
often commanded respect. In less than three years,
his wife and children were restored to him; and, after
a few weeks spent in seeing and being seen by friends
and relatives, they all settled themselves in employments,
<pb id="pickardxix" n="xix"/>
by which they are earning comfortable livelihoods,
and laying the foundation of future independence.</p>
        <p>It was thought, by most of those who had heard the
histories of Peter Still and Seth Concklin, that such
histories ought not to remain unwritten or unpublished.
It was believed that good narratives of both of these
remarkable men, would give to the people of the
Northern States some new illustrations of the horrors
of that “peculiar institution,” which has well-nigh
subjugated to itself our entire Republic.</p>
        <p>It so happened that a lady was at hand, singularly
qualified for the former and larger part of the task,
not only by her ability as a writer, but by her personal
acquaintance with Peter Still, while he was in
bondage. Mrs. Pickard had lived several years in the
very town, or neighborhood, where most of the events
transpired that would come into the narrative. She
knew personally many of the individuals, who had
acted conspicuous parts in the tragedy she was called
upon to write. Moreover, she had conceived a very
just appreciation of the character of this man and
woman, who, under the laws of our country, had been
subjected to all that domestic servitude can do to
imbrute human beings, and yet retained so much that
<pb id="pickardxx" n="xx"/>
is distinctive of the best specimens of our race. She
was therefore persuaded to undertake the work, which
is now given to the public.</p>
        <p>The writer of this narrative was a highly, esteemed
teacher in the Female Seminary of Tuscumbia, Alabama.
There Peter Still was employed in several
menial offices, and was subject to her observation
every day for many months. She often admired his
untiring diligence, his cheerful patience, his eagerness
to get work rather than to avoid it, and his earnest
gratefulness for the perquisites that were frequently
bestowed upon him by the many, whom he served in
various ways, and served so well. Little did she suspect
what was the mainspring of the intense life that she witnessed
in the poor slave-man, who seemed to her to have
so little to live for. She did not know that (as he has
since told her) he was “hungering and thirsting after liberty,”
which had been promised him by a compassionate Jew,
who then owned him, for a sum that it seemed
possible for him to accumulate. It was that hunger and
thirst which filled “Uncle Peter” with all the graces,
and brought him all the gifts, that he needed to attain
the object of his heart's desire. He had long been
known, and universally respected and loved, in the
town where he lived. Everybody believed that what
<pb id="pickardxxi" n="xxi"/>
Uncle Peter said was true; and that every duty imposed
upon him would be faithfully discharged. But
the amount of labor that he was then accustomed to
perform had come to be a matter of frequent remark
and admiration. Some attributed his severe toil to
the requirements of his Jew master. They had yet to
learn, that there is a harder driver than any Jewish or
Christian slaveholder, even the man's own spirit, when
the priceless boon of liberty is set before him, as an
incitement to exertion.</p>
        <p>We can promise the lovers of exciting adventure
very much in the ensuing volume to gratify their
taste; and all those who really desire to fathom the
heights and depths of that Iniquity which is threatening
the destruction of our Republic, may turn to these
pages, in the assurance that they will find in them a
great amount and variety of information, derived from
the most authentic sources, and given with the strictest
regard to truth.</p>
        <p>In this narrative will also be found, incidentally,
but very clearly given, intimations of many excellences
that are latent, as well as lively sketches of some
that are patent, in the negro variety of our race—indeed,
all the qualities of our common, and of our
uncommon humanity—persistence in the pursuit of a
<pb id="pickardxxii" n="xxii"/>
desired object; ingenuity in the device of plans for its
attainment; self-possession and self-command that can
long keep a cherished purpose unrevealed; a deep,
instinctive faith in God; a patience under hardship
and hope deferred, which never dies; and, withal, a
joyousness which, like a life-preserver, bears one above
the dark waves of unparalleled trouble<corr>.</corr></p>
        <p>The latter and smaller portion of this volume—the
Sketch of the Life of Seth Concklin—was written by
a gentleman who has long held so high a place among
American authors, that we shall not presume to give
him our commendation. That Dr. Wm. H. Furness,
of Philadelphia, deemed the merits of Seth Concklin to
be such as to deserve a tribute from his pen, must be
a sufficient assurance that the subject of this sketch
had evinced traits of character, and done deeds, or endured
trials, worthy of commemoration. Those who
know that Dr. Furness never touches anything that he
does not adorn, will go to the perusal of his portion of
this book, in the confident expectation of being delighted
with the unaffected beauty of the sketch, and
of having their sympathies and better feelings made
to flow in unison with those of the true-hearted author.
They will close the volume with gratitude to Dr. F.,
for having rescued from oblivion, and placed before
<pb id="pickardxxiii" n="xxiii"/>
his countrymen, another well-authenticated example
of successful conflict with appalling difficulties in early
life; of unwavering fidelity to right principles, in the
midst of great temptations; and of heroic, disinterested
self-sacrifice in the cause of suffering humanity.</p>

        <head>THE
<lb/>
KIDNAPPED AND THE RANSOMED.</head>
        <div2 type="chapter">
          <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
          <head>THE KIDNAPPER.</head>
          <p>LATE in the afternoon of a pleasant summer day,
two little boys were playing before the door of their
mother's cottage. They were apparently about six or
eight years old, and though their faces wore a dusky
hue, their hearts were gay, and their laugh rang out
clear and free.</p>
          <p>Their dress was coarse, and in no wise restrained the
motions of their agile limbs, for it consisted merely of
a cotton shirt, reaching no lower than the knee.</p>
          <p>How they ran races down the road, and turned summersets
on the green grass! How their eyes danced
with merriment, and their white teeth glistened in the
pleasant light!</p>
          <p>But as the day wore on they grew weary, and with
childhood's first impulse, sought their mother. She
was not in the house. All there was still and lonely.
In one corner stood her bed, covered with a clean
blanket, and the baby's cradle was empty by its side.
Grandmother's bed, in another corner of the room,
was made up nicely, and every article of the simple
furniture was in its accustomed place. Where could
they all have gone?</p>
          <p>“I reckon,” said Levin, “mammy's gone to church.
<pb id="pickard26" n="26"/>
The preachin' must be mighty long! O! I's so hongry!
I's gwine to meetin' to see if she's thar.”</p>
          <p>The “church” stood in the woods, about a mile off.
It was an old white building that had formerly been
occupied by the family of S. G., who now lived in a
large brick house close by. The boys had often been
at the church with their father, who kept the key of
the building, and opened it for worship on Sundays,
and prayer-meeting nights.</p>
          <p>“You better not go thar, I reckon,” replied Peter,
the younger of the two boys, “Mammy 'll whip you
well if you goes to foller her to meetin', and all about.”</p>
          <p>“Mammy! O Mammy!”</p>
          <p>Thus they called their mother, and cried because
she did not answer, till their eyes were swollen, and
their pleasant play forgotten.</p>
          <p>Soon the sound of wheels diverted them for a moment
from their childish grief, and looking up the
road, they saw a handsome gig approaching. Its only
occupant was a tall dark man, with black and glossy
hair, which fell heavily below his white hat.</p>
          <p>He looked earnestly at the little boys as he approached,
and marking their evident distress, he
checked his horse, and kindly asked the cause of their
sorrow.</p>
          <p>“Oh! Mammy's done gone off, and there's nobody
to give us our supper, and we're so hongry.”</p>
          <p>“Where is your mother?”</p>
          <p>“Don't know, sir,” replied Levin, “but I reckon
she's gone to church,”</p>
          <p>“Well, don't you want to ride? Jump up here
with me, and I'll take you to your mother. I'm just
going to church. Come! quick! What! no clothes
<pb id="pickard27" n="27"/>
but a shirt? Go in and get a blanket. It will be
night soon, and you will be cold.”</p>
          <p>Away they both ran for a blanket. Levin seized
one from his mother's bed, and in his haste pushed the
door against his brother, who was robbing his grandmother's
couch of its covering.</p>
          <p>The blanket was large, and little Peter, crying all
the while, was repeatedly tripped by its falling under
his feet while he was running to the gig.</p>
          <p>The stranger lifted them up, and placing them between
his feet, covered them carefully with the blankets,
that they might not be cold. He spoke kindly to them,
meanwhile, still assuring them that he would soon take
them to their mother.</p>
          <p>Away they went very swiftly, rejoicing in their
childish hearts to think how their mother would wonder
when she should see them coming.</p>
          <p>After riding for some time—how long they could
not guess—they suddenly upset in the water with a
great splash. The strange man had, in his haste, driven
too near the bank of the river, and the slight vehicle
had thus been overturned. He soon rescued the children
from the water. They were much frightened,
but nothing was injured by the accident, and in a few
minutes they were once more covered with the blankets,
and flying along the river bank faster even than before.</p>
          <p>When the gig stopped again, the sun was just setting.
They were at the water side, and before them
lay many boats, and vessels of different kinds. They
had never seen anything like these before, but they
had short time to gratify their childish curiosity; for
they were hurried on board a boat, which left the shore
immediately.</p>
          <pb id="pickard28" n="28"/>
          <p>With the assurance that they should now find their
mother, they trusted implicitly, in their new-made
friend; who strengthened their confidence in himself
by gentle words and timely gifts. Cakes of marvellous
sweetness were ever ready for them, if they grew impatient
of the length of the journey; and their childish
hearts could know no distrust of one whose words
and acts were kind.</p>
          <p>How long they were on the boat they did not know;
nor by what other means they travelled could they
afterwards remember, until they reached Versailles,
Kentucky. Here their self-constituted guardian, whom
they now heard addressed as Kincaid, placed them in a
wagon with a colored woman and her child, and conveyed
them to Lexington.</p>
          <p>This was the first town they had ever seen, and as
they were conducted up Main street, they were filled
with wonder and admiration.</p>
          <p>Kincaid took them to a plain brick house where
dwelt one John Fisher, a mason by trade, and proprietor
of a large brick yard.</p>
          <p>After some conversation between the gentlemen,
which of course the children did not understand,
they were taken out to the kitchen, and presented to
Aunt Betty, the cook.</p>
          <p>“There, my, boys,” said Kincaid, “there is your
mother—we've found her at last.”</p>
          <p>“No! no!” they shrieked, “that's not our mother!
O, please, sir! take us back!” With tears and cries
they clung to him who had abused their guileless
trust, and begged him not to leave them there.</p>
          <p>This scene was soon ended by John Fisher himself,
who, with a hearty blow on each cheek, bade them
<pb id="pickard29" n="29"/>
“hush!” “you belong to me now, you little rascals,
and I'll have no more of this. There's Aunt Betty,
she's your mammy now; and if you behave yourselves,
she'll be good to you.”</p>
          <p>Kincaid soon departed, and they never saw him
again. They learned, however, from a white apprentice,
who lived in the house, that he received from. Mr.
Fisher one hundred and fifty-five dollars for Levin,
and one hundred and fifty for Peter.</p>
          <p>Poor children! what a heavy cloud now shadowed
their young lives!</p>
          <p>For the first few weeks they talked constantly of
going back to their mother—except when their master
was near. They soon learned that they must not
mention the subject in his presence.</p>
          <p>He was, in the main, a kind, indulgent man—but
were they not his money? Why should he allow
them to prate about being stolen, when he had bought
them, and paid a right good price?</p>
          <p>“Father,” said John Fisher, junior, “isn't Philadelphia
in a free State?”</p>
          <p>“Certainly—it is in Pennsylvania.”</p>
          <p>“Well, then, I reckon those two boys you bought
<hi rend="italics">were</hi> stolen, for they lived with their mother near the
Delaware river; and Aunt Betty says that is at Philadelphia.
It was too bad, father, for that man to steal
them and sell them here, where they can never hear
from their mother!”</p>
          <p>“Pooh, boy! don't talk like a fool! Most likely
they were sold to Kincaid, and he told them he would
take them to their mother, in order to get them away
without any fuss. And even if he did steal them—so
were all the negroes stolen at first. I bought these
<pb id="pickard30" n="30"/>
boys, and paid for them, and I'll stop their talk about
being free, or I'll break their black necks. A pretty
tale that, to go about the country—just to spoil the
sale if I should happen to wish to get shut of them!
Free, indeed! And what is a free nigger? They're
better off here than if they were free, growing up in
idleness, and with nobody to take care of them.”</p>
          <p>Before night the young offenders were thoroughly
kicked and beaten, and received the assurance that
they should be killed outright if they dared to tell
such a tale again. So they grew cautious; and spoke
those sweet memories of home and mother only in
whispers to each other, or to some follow-slave that
knew how to sympathize with their sorrows.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="chapter">
          <pb id="pickard31" n="31"/>
          <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
          <head>EARLY EXPERIENCE IN SLAVERY.</head>
          <p>THE long, hard lesson of slavery was now fairly
open before our young students. In vain they shrank
from its dreadful details. In vain they appealed for
pity to their hard-handed master. Page after page of
dark experiences shadowed their boyish eyes, and their
young hearts, so merry hitherto, grew sad and anxious.</p>
          <p>The necessity of concealing the true feelings is
among the rudiments of slavery's lore. A servant
should be merry. A gloomy face is a perpetual complaint,
and why should it be tolerated?</p>
          <p>To this necessity the temperament of the African is
most happily suited. Cheerful and warm-hearted, with
an innate love of light and harmony, the slightest
sympathy awakens his affection, and the faintest dawn of
happiness provokes a smile.</p>
          <p>Levin and Peter were not long in divining, with the
tact of childhood, their exact position, domestic and social.</p>
          <p>Their master was a large, fine looking man, with a
free, hearty manner, and much real kindliness of disposition.
He never allowed this latter quality, however,
to interfere in business matters; and as, in addition
to the business of brickmaking, he rented a large
plantation about a mile out of town, he had no time
to waste in unprofitable sentimentalities. How to get
<pb id="pickard32" n="32"/>
the most work done with the least expense he regarded
as a problem worthy of his attention, and his success
in business proved that he considered it well.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Fisher was a stout, freckle-faced lady, plain
and unpretending in her dress and manner, and perfectly
devoted to her husband and children. She had,
at the time of which we speak, two boys, John and
Sydney; and for the first three years that he lived
with them, Peter was their constant playmate. Levin
was sent to the brick-yard the second year after Fisher
purchased them, he being at that time only nine years
old.</p>
          <p>At night the little slave boys rolled themselves up
in their blankets, and slept on the floor in their mistress'
room. They often waked in the morning under
the bed, or the bureau, where Mrs. Fisher had shoved
them with her foot, the night previous—that they
might be out of the way. They were comfortably
clothed, well fed, and—if they said nothing of their
mother's house on the Delaware river—kindly treated.
But if a word on that forbidden subject reached their
master's ear, he became a monster. By stripes and
kicks he taught them that they had no right to that
blessed memory, that they were his property, and that
he possessed the power to quiet their restless tongues.</p>
          <p>The plantation which was rented by Mr. Fisher belonged
to Mrs. Russell, a widow lady, and lay about a
mile from the city, across the road from the residence
of Henry Clay. Here, while Peter was too young to
work in the brick-yard, he was sent daily for the cows,
and for vegetables from the garden; and as he had
plenty of leisure, he spent many happy hours in playing
with the little colored children at Mr. Clay's.
<pb id="pickard33" n="33"/>
Frequently the merry group was joined by young
Masters Theodore and Thomas Clay, and then the
sport was liveliest.</p>
          <p>The heart of the little new-made slave glowed with
love for these noble boys, and he soon confided to
them his sad history; and one day, when Mrs. Clay,
as was her custom, spoke kindly to the dusky playmate
of her sons, he simply recited to her the story of his
sorrows, and asked her if she did not think some one
would send him back to his mother.</p>
          <p>She quieted him with cakes and other delicacies, to
the palate of the child exceeding grateful, and then
gently dismissed the children to their play.</p>
          <p>But the brave-hearted <hi rend="italics">boys</hi> were young enough to
long <hi rend="italics">to do</hi> something for their little favorite, and bade
him tell his story to their father, who, they assured
him, would send him back. There was true Kentucky
generosity in their breasts, and they felt sure their
honored father could not fail to do his utmost to redress
such a cruel wrong.</p>
          <p>“O Levin!” whispered Peter, the first time he was
alone with his brother. “I reckon we'll go back to-reckly!”</p>
          <p>“Go back! whar?”</p>
          <p>“Why home, to see mother! Mass' Theodore Clay
say, his father so good to everybody, he know he'll
send us back if we tell him how we got stole—says
his father allers <hi rend="italics">hope</hi> folks whar gits in trouble.”</p>
          <p>“Mass' Theodore say so? Reckon then we will,
kase Mr. Clay mighty good to all his people. Hi!
Mars John Fisher! you's gwine lose these chillerns!”</p>
          <p>And with comical grimaces, Levin cut a series of
<pb id="pickard34" n="34"/>
shuffles, indicating the confusion that awaited “Mars
John.”</p>
          <p>Not long after this conversation, Peter saw Mr. Clay
standing near the court-house with a letter in his hand.
His little heart bounded with hope as he ran towards
him.</p>
          <p>“O Mr. Clay!” he exclaimed, “I'm stole!”</p>
          <p>“Stole? Who stole you, and where were you stolen
from?”</p>
          <p>“I's stolen from my father and mother on Delaware
river—folks say that's Philadelphia—but I don' know.
Please, sir, won't you send me back to my mother?”</p>
          <p>“To whom do you belong?”</p>
          <p>“I 'long to Mars John Fisher, on Main street, and I
wants to go back to my mother.”</p>
          <p>“Well, my boy, I have no time to talk to you now;
you carry this letter to Major Pope—you know were
he lives—and then come back and I'll attend to you.”</p>
          <p>Away ran the child dancing with delight, and crying,
“I's free! I's free! I's gwine to my mother!”</p>
          <p>“What is that you say?” asked a gentleman who
met him. “I's gwine to be free! Mr. Clay gwine to
send me back to my mother, kase I was stole away
from her!”</p>
          <p>“Now look here, you little negro,” said the man,
who knew the child, and understood the temper of his
master, “you'd better not talk about that to Mr. Clay,
for he will tell your master, and then old John Fisher
will be sure to skin you.”</p>
          <p>The bright vision that Hope had held before the
trusting boy faded away. With drooping bead and
tearful eye he returned to tell his brother of their disappointment,
<pb id="pickard35" n="35"/>
and after that they both avoided Mr. Clay.</p>
          <p>Yet Hope did not desert them; but whispered often
in their eager ears—“You shall return; your friends
will come to seek you. You were born free, and slaves
you shall not die!”</p>
          <p>When Peter was about nine years old, he too was
employed in the brick-yard, as “<hi rend="italics">off-bearer.</hi>” Three
thousand brick a day was the task for two boys; and
if one of them chanced to be by any means disabled,
his companion must “<hi rend="italics">off-bear</hi>” the whole. The moulder
must not be hindered.</p>
          <p>These moulders—slaves themselves—were cruel
tyrants. The boys, though seldom abused by the
master himself, were subject to all <hi rend="italics">their</hi> caprices and
passions. If one of inferior station failed to perform
his task, they know no mercy; and their master <hi rend="italics">permitted</hi>
any punishment they chose to inflict.</p>
          <p>Their favorite mode of chastisement was called
“<hi rend="italics">standing in the wheelbarrow.</hi>” The offender was
placed with a foot on each side of the wheel, and compelled
to reach over and grasp a handle in each hand;
and then the youngest boys—the “<hi rend="italics">off-bearers</hi>”—were
compelled to whip him with cowhides. If he would
lie still, and take twenty-four lashes without attempting
to rise, that was deemed sufficient proof of his
humility. But if he made an effort to change his
position before that number was inflicted, the moulder
who presided over the ceremony, and who counted
off the strokes, commenced again at “<hi rend="italics">one,</hi>” and caused
the twenty-four to be repeated.</p>
          <p>One day a large man, named Charles, was put into
the wheelbarrow, and received over three hundred
<pb id="pickard36" n="36"/>
blows before he was sufficiently subdued to lie still,
and take twenty-four without moving. The boys that
were selected to inflict this horrible punishment (of
whom Peter was one) were all trembling with terror;
but if one of them, through pity, failed to strike with
his utmost strength, the moulder, who stood aside
with a cowhide, punished his merciful folly by a violent
blow upon his own back.</p>
          <p>Amid such scenes passed the childhood of these
hapless boys. Their natural cheerfulness and mildness
of temper made them universal favorites. In
their own person, therefore, they endured few such
sufferings as they were forced to witness. A “Boston
clergyman,” carefully observing their every-day life,
would have pronounced them happy, careless boys;
so ardently attached to their young masters and their
follow servants, that it would be really unkind to set
them free. They were well fed—their clothes were
comfortable—all they needed was supplied without
their thought or care.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
          <head>MASTER NATTIE.</head>
          <p>WHEN Peter was about thirteen years old, Mr.
Fisher planned a removal to Cincinnati, where his
brother had recently gone. He disposed of his brick-yard,
and intended to sell all his servants, except
Aunt Betty, the cook, with her daughter and grandchild.
These he could not spare, as they were indispensable
to the comfort of the family.</p>
          <p>Levin and Peter were overwhelmed with grief at
the news of the intended sale. There was degradation
in the thought of being trafficked for like horses;
for, with all their apparent humility, and their submissive,
gentle manners, there was a principle deep in
their hearts that claimed the birthright of humanity.</p>
          <p>Besides, they had, through all these years, cherished
the hope that they should yet be sought by their
parents; and they knew that if they changed owners,
the chances of their being discovered would be lessened.</p>
          <p>But their destiny was fixed. Mr. Fisher found
some difficulty in disposing of them, for their old story
of being stolen was remembered, and men hesitated to
buy where there was a shadow of uncertainty in the
title. Their master, however, so confidently asserted
that he had conquered them, and it was so many years
<pb id="pickard38" n="38"/>
since they had been heard to say anything on the subject,
that a sale was at last effected.</p>
          <p>The purchaser was Mr. Nat. Gist, of Lexington, and
he paid four hundred and fifty dollars for each of the
brothers.</p>
          <p>Mr. Fisher did not, as he had anticipated, go to Cincinnati,
but remained in Lexington for several years,
and then he removed with his family to Louisville,
Ky.</p>
          <p>The change of owners was far from being an agreeable
one to Levin and Peter. Nat. Gist, their new
master, lived in a small brick house on Dutch street,
or, as it was sometimes called, Hill street. He was
a short, stout, gray-headed man, about fifty-six years
of age, a Virginian by birth, and had been a revolutionary
soldier. He swore hard, and drank to intoxication
every day; therefore, as he was a bachelor, his
home was seldom visited by any humanizing influence.</p>
          <p>He owned a brick-yard of about five acres, and
had, in all, twenty slaves. These he fed sparingly,
clothed scantily, and worked hard. In the winter,
when they could not make brick, he was accustomed
to hire them out wherever he could get the highest
price for their services.</p>
          <p>Mr. Gist had now among his people four boys—
Levin and Peter, with Alfred and Allison, who were
also brothers. They had been brought from Virginia,
where their parents still remained.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref1" n="1" rend="sc" target="note1">* </ref></p>
          <note id="note1" n="1" rend="sc" place="ffot" anchored="yes" target="ref1">
            <p>* The mother of these two boys, who belonged to one George
Lewis, in Virginia, has recently, with several of her other children,
escaped from slavery, and travelled, by the “underground 
railroad,” to Canada.</p>
          </note>
          <pb id="pickard39" n="39"/>
          <p>Peter was not long in becoming a special favorite
with his new master. Yet the strange old man never
evinced his preference by any peculiar kindness of
word or act. That would contradict his theory. He
believed there was nothing so good for a<hi rend="italics"> nigger</hi> as frequent
floggings; and while he kept Peter near him
as much as possible, and always chose him to wait
upon him, he never abated towards him a jot of his
accustomed severity. An incident that occurred soon
after he purchased the two boys of Mr. Fisher, will
illustrate his method of governing them.</p>
          <p>He had come home from town, as usual, much intoxicated,
and ordered Peter to scatter a couple of
bundles of oats on the ground, for his horse. The
boy obeyed, but strewed them over rather more space
than was necessary. In a few minutes, his master appeared.</p>
          <p>“Did you feed Ned his oats?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Sir.”</p>
          <p>“I'll see if you have done it right.” And, muttering
curses as he went, he proceeded to the yard, where
the horse was eating.</p>
          <p>“What the d—l did you throw them all about for?”</p>
          <p>“Why, mass'r, you told me to scatter 'em.”</p>
          <p>Quick the old man's cane descended on the offender's
head. “I did'nt tell you to scatter them all over
the yard. Follow me to the house. I'll give you a
lesson.”</p>
          <p>Peter walked slowly behind him to the door.</p>
          <p>“Now take off your shirt, you rascal, and cross
your hands.”</p>
          <p>The boy obeyed; and his master, after tying, his
hands together, drew them down over his knees, where
<pb id="pickard40" n="40"/>
he confined them by means of a stick thrust under his
knees. He then beat him with a cowhide, first on one
side, and then on the other, till his drunken rage was
appeased. “There, you black <hi rend="italics">cuss</hi>,” cried he, when
he had finished, “I mean to make a good nigger of
you, and there's no way to do it, only by showing you
who's master.”</p>
          <p>This method of confining a negro for punishment is
called “<hi rend="italics">bucking</hi>” him, and it is much practised in
slave-land. The culprit is frequently left in the
“<hi rend="italics">buck</hi>” several hours—sometimes, indeed, all night—
and, in such cases, the protracted straining of the
muscles causes intense pain.</p>
          <p>A few benevolent individuals, about this time, established
a Sabbath School in Lexington, for the instruction
of such slaves as might be permitted by their
masters to learn.</p>
          <p>At this proceeding Master Nattie was indignant.
He would not have <hi rend="italics">his</hi> niggers spoiled by getting
Learning—no, indeed! Niggers were bad enough,
without being set up by such rascals as these Sunday
School teachers. They'd better not meddle with <hi rend="italics">his</hi>
property; and if he heard of one of <hi rend="italics">his</hi> boys going
near the school, he'd give him such a flogging that
he'd never need any more education.</p>
          <p>But in the breast of one of these slave boys burned
a thirst for knowledge so intense, that even this terrible
threat could not deter him from making one effort
to learn. Peter went to the school.</p>
          <p>The teacher received him kindly, and inquired for
his “<hi rend="italics">pass.</hi>”</p>
          <p>“Ain't got none, massa.”</p>
          <p>“I am sorry,” said the teacher, “for we are not permitted
<pb id="pickard41" n="41"/>
to instruct any servants without the consent of
their masters.”</p>
          <p>Peter knew this very well; and he also knew that
to ask his master for a pass would be only to apply
for a whipping; but he did so long to learn to read,
he could not go away. He looked around on the
pupils. Their masters allowed them to come, and
surely not one of them could learn so quick as he. He
determined to make a desperate effort to stay that one
day, at least. So he told the teacher that his master
<hi rend="italics">didn't care nothin' 'bout his comin'</hi>—he'd get a pass
next Sunday; and he was permitted to remain.</p>
          <p>The next Sabbath, when the school was opened,
Peter stood among the pupils. The other boys presented
their passes—his did not appear. <hi rend="italics">He had forgotten
to ask his master</hi>, but would be sure to remember
it the next Sunday.</p>
          <p>But on the third Sabbath he was no better off. <hi rend="italics">His
master had gone from home early in the morning,</hi> and
of course it was impossible for him to get a pass in his
absence. The teacher once more allowed him to remain,
but assured him that no such excuses would be
taken in future.</p>
          <p>The fourth Sabbath came, and Peter walked boldly
into the school. “Pass, boy!” as usual, was the first
salutation.</p>
          <p>“Ain't got none,” replied he. “Mass' Nattie say,
don't need none; no use, no how.”</p>
          <p>The teacher began to suspect the true state of the
case, and though he would gladly have aided to illumine
that eager intellect, that was “stretching forward
to the light,” yet he was forced to thrust it back into
the darkness, lest a prejudice should be aroused which
<pb id="pickard42" n="42"/>
would palsy all his efforts. So he positively forbade
Peter's future entrance to the school without a pass,
and he was thereafter obliged to seek for amusement
on Sundays in some other direction. He had, in these
four Sundays, learned the alphabet, and could spell a
few words, and hard and bitter was the fate that consigned
him thenceforward to ignorance.</p>
          <p>“Oh,” thought he, “if I could only learn to read!
I could find out the way to write myself. Then I
might write letters to Philadelphia, and let our mother
know what's 'come of her chilluns. There's white boys
in town that goes to school every day, that would a
heap ruther play in the street. I's seen 'em runnin'
off to keep clar of the mas'r in the mornin'. Reckon,
if I could go to school, nobody wouldn't cotch me runnin'
off that way.”</p>

          <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
          <head>THE TOBACCO FACTORY.</head>
          <p>AFTER Levin and Peter had worked for four summers
in the brickyard, their master hired them,
with Alfred and Allison, to Mr. George Norton, a tobacconist,
who at that time carried on an extensive business
in Lexington.</p>
          <p>They had been hired out before to different persons
during the winter. Peter had, one winter, served as
waiter, a cousin of his master, Mr. Sandford Keene.
This was his first introduction to house service, as well
as his first experience, since he became a slave,
of genuine kindness. Mrs. Keene was a noble-hearted lady,
who delighted to promote the happiness of all around
her, and Peter loved to serve her acceptably.</p>
          <p>But to this Mr. Norton they were hired for the
whole year; and violent as Master Nattie in his
phrensied hours, and carefully as he avoided every
indulgence towards them which might seem to recognize
their humanity, they dreaded to exchange him
for this new master, for of him report spake never
kindly.</p>
          <p>Mr. George Norton—ah! how grand he looked as
he stood near the shop door conversing with his overseer!
His broad-brimmed hat seemed conscious of its
<pb id="pickard44" n="44"/>
<hi rend="italics">elevated</hi> position, and his hair descending in a cue
behind was stiff and stately. The very smoke from
his cigar ascended with a consequential puff, and his
cane thumped on the sidewalk in exact accordance
with the great man's varying moods. It had a gentle
tap to answer words of compliment, or salutations from
the rich or beautiful. But when a breath of contradiction
came, or any sable menial hesitated to obey
his slightest wish, the expressive staff beat furiously
upon the pavement, in token of the vengeance that
should fall upon the offender's head.</p>
          <p>A fit foil to his pompous superior was the overseer,
Mr. Kisich. Small and pale, awkward in his manners,
and “slightly lame,” he seemed totally indifferent
to his personal appearance, and gloried only in
the force and accuracy with which he could execute
his employer's plans.</p>
          <p>He was a native of the Emerald Isle, as his “rich
brogue” plainly indicated; and, like some of his more
distinguished countrymen in these later days, claimed
liberty <hi rend="italics">for Irishmen</hi>, and equality with the noblest in
every land. But when
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“He found his fellow guilty of a skin</l><l>Not colored like his own,”</l></lg></q>
he could see him bought and sold, and tasked, and
beaten, without a single impulse of pity.</p>
          <p>About thirty men and boys were employed in Mr.
Norton's establishment. Of these, three were white
men, who were hired to do that part of the work which
required more experience and skill than the negroes
were supposed to possess. These acted as spies and
<pb id="pickard45" n="45"/>
informers; making the privilege of tyrannizing over
their dark-skinned fellows, a sort of compensation for
the degradation which is inseparable, in slave-land,
from the necessity of labor.</p>
          <p>Peter and Allison succeeded admirably in pleasing
Mr. Norton. He liked their ready obedience, and their
sprightly, nimble movements. When he gave an
order, he could not wait with patience its dilatory
execution, and they loved to surprise him by returning
from an errand, or by finishing a task earlier than
he expected. Yet by this they won no praise. It was
but their duty, and they had reason to rejoice if, by
performing it, they escaped the cow-hide.</p>
          <p>For several months they thus succeeded in avoiding
any outbreak of his wrath. They had been accustomed
to no mild exercise of authority, and the angry
strife they often witnessed, seemed to them, if not
quite necessary, unavoidable at times. <hi rend="italics">Force</hi> was their
law, and <hi rend="italics">force</hi> their motive to obedience; and but for
their brother-love, and the warm memory of their
mother, their hearts must have grown callous and
incapable of affectionate response.</p>
          <p>For Levin and Peter there was ever a bright morning
in remembrance, and they were young—could they
live without the hope of returning once more to that
mother-home? Humble was the cabin which they
delighted to remember, but the sunshine came freely
in at the open door, and no harsh word was ever heard
within the lowly walls.</p>
          <p>How sweet, how soothing, was the influence of these
cherished retrospects! How often, when their tasks
were finished, the two brothers strolled away from the
noisy mirth with which their companions were beguiling
<pb id="pickard46" n="46"/>
the twilight hour, and in low tones discussed the possibilities
of an escape from slavery—a return to the
dear home where they had known no care nor fear.</p>
          <p>A hundred plans they at different times suggested
to each other, but the execution of any one of them
required more knowledge than they possessed, or
could acquire. And then there were so many that
failed in such attempts. The jail was always tenanted
by captured fugitives. No—they could not run away.</p>
          <p>But perhaps, some day, they might buy their freedom.
They could work nights and Sundays, and earn
the money, and then they would be safe. This was
their favorite aerial abode, and here they enjoyed many
bright anticipations. But alas! they soon learned by
the sad experience of others, that such a plan was all
uncertain. The history of one man of their acquaintance
in Lexington, taught them a lesson of caution on
that point, that chilled their ardent hopes, and deepened
their distrust of <hi rend="italics">seeming friends.</hi></p>
          <p>Spencer, a fine-looking intelligent mulatto, belonged
to a Mr. Williams, who kept a lottery office in Lexington.
His master, having no need of his services,
hired him out; usually to the keepers of hotels or livery
stables, and sometimes to Spencer himself. He was a
great favorite with the white people, and had excellent
opportunities of making money; not only by extra
services about the hotels or stables, but also by doctoring
horses, in which he had much skill.</p>
          <p>He sometimes speculated in lottery tickets, but here
his success availed him little. He drew at one time a
house and lot in Lexington, valued at $30,000, and
although many white people declared that it would be
a shame to deprive him of the benefit of his good fortune,
<pb id="pickard47" n="47"/>
yet it was on the whole deemed an unsafe precedent
to allow <hi rend="italics">a negro</hi> to acquire so much property.
So the prize was finally awarded to a gentleman in
Philadelphia, who stood second in the list of successful
competitors.</p>
          <p>Soon after this, Spencer conceived the idea of buying
his freedom, and proposed the subject to his master.
Mr. Williams received it favorably, and fixed the price
at one thousand dollars.</p>
          <p>Spencer, habitually industrious, had now a new animation
in his labors; and so untiring was his diligence,
that in a few years he had paid his master within
twenty-five dollars of the whole sum. The goal of
all his hopes was just in sight, when lo! the perfidious
tyrant denied ever having promised him his liberty,
and bade him never mention the subject more.</p>
          <p>Spencer was sorely disappointed, but not discouraged,
and when not long after a gentleman who had heard the
history of this deception offered to purchase him, and
to give him his freedom as soon as he could earn the
price which he must pay to Williams, the hopeful slave
eagerly accepted the offer.</p>
          <p>The bargain was soon concluded, and with new zeal,
the bondman commenced his labors. He took the precaution
this time, to ask for a receipt whenever he
made a payment. This was readily given, and Spencer
deemed himself safe. But behold! when he had paid
all but seventy dollars, his new master suddenly left
town; and before the poor slave was aware of any approaching
change, an agent to whose care he had been
consigned, had sold him to another master. He was
indignant at this outrageous fraud, and produced his
receipts, which he had carefully preserved. But these
<pb id="pickard48" n="48"/>
availed nothing. They did not show to whom the
money had been paid. And even if they had been
properly written they would have profited nothing—
for does not a slave's money as well as his person and
his labor, belong to his master?</p>
          <p>Still hope died not in Spencer's breast. Again he
tried a man who had been lavish of his sympathy, and
loud in his denunciations of the baseness by which he
had suffered. Into his hands—for the third time—he
paid the hard-earned price of his redemption; and when
he should have received his free papers, and a pass out
of the State, he was chained in a gang, and sent to the
cotton and sugar fields of the south.</p>
          <p>To the ears of Peter and his brother came many tales
like this, and in their inmost hearts were treasured the
lessons of caution which they imparted. Surely there
was none <hi rend="italics">they</hi> could trust. It were far better, by apparent
contentment, and by cheerful manners, to win
the confidence of those in whose power they were placed,
than to become objects of suspicion and dislike, by ill-timed
efforts to be free. So they toiled on, their genial
sunny natures, and the warm heart-love ever fresh
within their breasts, preserving them from despair.</p>
          <p>Half the year at Mr. Norton's had passed away, and
neither of the boys belonging to old Nattie Gist had
fallen into any serious difficulty. They had witnessed
many exhibitions of their employer's cruelty, and one
which occurred about this time, filled their hearts with
horror.</p>
          <p>Mr. Norton's body-servant, a large black man,
chanced one day to offend his haughty master. He
was immediately put in a buck, and in the presence of
all the men and boys, Norton inflicted on his naked
<pb id="pickard49" n="49"/>
back three hundred lashes with a cowhide. The blood
gushed out, and ran in streams upon the brick floor of
the shop.</p>
          <p>When the stick was removed from under his knees,
the poor victim was unable to rise. At this his tormentor
was enraged. He seized a board that lay near,
full of shingle nails, and with it struck him several
violent blows, every one of which brought the blood
in streams, as though he had been pierced with lancets.</p>
          <p>The slaves who witnessed this horrid deed were
paralyzed with fear, but the white men swore it was
just right. The cursed niggers—they must be conquered,
or they would not be worth a d—n.</p>
          <p>Here young Peter's caution for a moment failed.
His eyes, usually so mild, flashed fiercely, and he declared
in a low voice to his brother that George Norton
should never strip him and put <hi rend="italics">him</hi> in a buck to whip
him—<hi rend="italics">he would die first.</hi></p>
          <p>Poor boy! his rash speech was overheard, and reported
to the tyrant, who from that day waited only
an excuse to punish his presumption.</p>
          <p>The next Saturday evening, as the boys were sweeping
the shop, an old woman came in and asked for
some tobacco. Peter, being nearest the door, gathered
up a handful of the sweepings, and gave them to her.</p>
          <p>On the following morning, it was Peter's turn to
make a fire in the sweat-room; and when he had performed
this duty, he locked the door of the shop and
went to his old master's where he usually spent his
Sundays. Here he played marbles, and enjoyed such
other sports as are proper for the Sabbath-rest of slave-boys,
while their young masters are at the Sunday-school
<pb id="pickard50" n="50"/>
or in the billiard-room—according to their
tastes.</p>
          <p>Peter had been absent from the shop but a short
time when Mr. Norton himself took a fancy to go in
and look at the tobacco. He tried the door, but it
was locked, and the key was nowhere to be found.
His anger rose. Ah! Peter, a heavy cloud is gathering,
and there is no shelter for thy defenceless head!</p>
          <p>Early Monday morning, Mr. Norton came into the
shop. His eyes looked darker and brighter than usual,
and the smoke from his cigar came in quick passionate
puffs. His cane, too, beat an ominous march upon
the floor. Something was wrong.</p>
          <p>The great man spoke. “Whose business was it to
make a fire in the sweat-room yesterday?”</p>
          <p>“Mine, sir,” said Peter.</p>
          <p>“Did you attend to it?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">You did!</hi> where were you when I came here?”</p>
          <p>“Don't know, sir,—reckon I was up home.”</p>
          <p>“Where is your <hi rend="italics">home</hi>, your rascal?”</p>
          <p>“Up to Mars Nattie's, sir.”</p>
          <p>“I'll let you know, nigger, that this is your home,
and that I am your master!” and with a furious thumping
of his cane, the mighty man strode out of the shop.
He was in a rage. It always made him angry for one
of his <hi rend="italics">hired</hi> servants to call his owner, “<hi rend="italics">Master;”—it
was his law</hi> that in his shop no one should receive that
ennobling title except himself.</p>
          <p>Before sunrise the next morning, just as the work
of the day was commenced, Mr. Norton appeared at
the door. He stood a few minutes perfectly still, and
<pb id="pickard51" n="51"/>
then taking out his knife, he commenced trimming a
switch—whistling meantime a beautiful march.</p>
          <p>The sweet notes woke no answering melody in the
hearts of those within, for well they knew the spirit of
their master. Only when about to inflict some cruel
punishment did George Norton utter sounds like these.</p>
          <p>His march ended, he spoke—</p>
          <p>“Peter!”</p>
          <p>“Sir.”</p>
          <p>“Where were you, yesterday?”</p>
          <p>“Here, sir, strippin' tobacco.<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“Well, Sunday, where were you?”</p>
          <p>“Home, to Mars Nattie's, sir.”</p>
          <p>The hot blood mounted to Mr. Norton's face.
“<hi rend="itlaics">I</hi> am your master, rascal, and I'll let you know you are
to go to no other <hi rend="italics">home</hi> than this! Who swept the
shop on Saturday?”</p>
          <p>“We boys, sir, all of us.”</p>
          <p>“Who gave tobacco to an old woman?”</p>
          <p>“I gave her a handful of sweepings, sir,—no 'count,
no how, sir.”</p>
          <p>“Well, you'll find <hi rend="italics">I</hi> am your master, and you are
to obey me. Come here, and lie down across this
box.”</p>
          <p>Peter obeyed, wondering at the same time that he
had not been ordered to strip. It was not Mr. Norton's
custom to whip his servants over their clothes,
and the boy had on a new suit of blue linsey. But
he had heard of the expression he had made a few
days before, and perhaps thought best to avoid an
unnecessary contest.</p>
          <p>No sooner was the boy extended across the designated
box, than Norton struck him a violent blow.
<pb id="pickard52" n="52"/>
Peter raised up. “Lie down you nigger!” and he renewed
the blows with greater force. Peter raised
up again. “Lie down!” cried the fury, with a curse.
Peter obeyed the third <sic corr="time">tie</sic>, and them blows fell hard
and fast.</p>
          <p>Once more he raised up. “Lie down! I say, you
cursed nigger—if you move again till I bid you, I will
beat you till you cannot rise.”</p>
          <p>The boy stood upright, and looked his tormentor
steadily in the face. “I have laid down three times
for you to beat me, when I have done nothing wrong;
I will not lie down again!”</p>
          <p>Instantly Norton seized him, and attempted to force
him across the box—but was unable. “Here, Mr.
Kisich! Tadlock! all of you! help me conquer this
nigger!</p>
          <p>Quick to his aid came the overseer, and the three
other white men that worked in the shop, and all fell
upon him at once, while Peter screamed “<hi rend="italics">Murder!</hi>”
and fought with his utmost strength.</p>
          <p>People in the street heard the tumult, and gathered
about the doors of the shop; when Norton ordered
them closed and fastened. Among those thus excluded
was Sandford Keene, the nephew of old Nattie Gist.
He listened to the uproar with anxious ears, but could
not determine from which of the boys the cries proceeded.
Had he known that it was Peter, his special
favorite, to whom also his wife was much attached,
he could hardly have refrained from rushing in to his
rescue.</p>
          <p>The ruffians tried to bind his hands, but he struggled
so fiercely that they were in danger of breaking his
bones. That would have been too costly an amusement.
<pb id="pickard53" n="53"/>
But they succeeded in throwing him upon the
floor, and there he struggled, and screamed, and bit
their legs and ankles, till they despaired of holding
him in any position, unless they could succeed in tying
him.</p>
          <p>One of them, accordingly, prepared a slip noose,
and threw it over his head when he rose up—with
intent to choke him. He perceived their purpose, and
quickly raising both hands, thrust them through the
noose and slipped it down below his arms.</p>
          <p>Thus baffled in one scheme, they resorted to another.
Dragging him along by the rope now fastened around
his waist, they proceeded to the back part of the shop
where stood five or six presses, each about eight feet
high. If they could hang him up on one of these he
would be entirely at their mercy. But he foiled them
here. As they raised the rope to fasten it to the top
of the press, he sprang one side, and crept into the
narrow space between it and the wall.</p>
          <p>Here he remained for some time. Bleeding and
panting—his bloodshot eyes glared at his persecutors,
who, on both sides, were engaged in beating him over
the head with cow-hides and hoop-poles, and thrusting
sticks and pieces of iron against his bruised flesh.</p>
          <p>At last they dragged him from his partial hiding
place; and now he made no resistance—he had not
strength to struggle. Norton threw him across a keg,
and with fiendish curses, whipped his bleeding back
with a cowhide; swearing he was the first nigger that
ever tried to fight him, and that he should be humbled
if it took his life.</p>
          <p>When this correction was finished it was nearly ten
<pb id="pickard54" n="54"/>
o'clock; and, commanding the other slaves, who stood
agape with horror, to go to work, Mr. Norton, followed
by his aids, went to the house for breakfast. They
had exercised sufficiently to eat with good appetites;
and while they were enjoying a plentiful repast, and
discussing in their own peculiar style, the “obstinacy
of the nigger,” their poor victim, bruised and torn,
with only a few shreds left of his new suit of linsey,
crept out of the shop, and with his little remaining
strength, succeeded in gaining the residence of his
master, on the hill.</p>
          <p>Old Nattie Gist had, according to his morning custom,
gone down town. Aunt Mary, the cook, however,
received him kindly, pitied him, and dressed his
wounds. She had a human mother's heart, <hi rend="italics">and her
two boys were slaves.</hi></p>
          <p>Peter guessed rightly, that his old master, cruel as
he was himself, would not like to see his property thus
damaged by others. Yet he spoke no gentle word to
the sufferer. He would not intimate to a “<hi rend="italics">nigger</hi>”
that a white man could do him wrong. But he sought
Norton, and cursed him roundly for inflicting such
abuse upon a boy of his.</p>
          <p>For a week he allowed Peter to stay at home, and
then he sent him back to the shop. Here he remained
till the end of the year. Norton was evidently either
ashamed of his previous violence, or afraid to repeat
its exercise, for never after that, did Peter receive an
unkind word from him or either of his satellites.</p>
          <p>Just before Christmas, Mr. Norton went to old Master
Nattie, and, assuring him that the boys were all
perfectly satisfied with the past, and anxious to remain
<pb id="pickard55" n="55"/>
with him, hired them for another year. But when
their time expired, they all ran off together to their
master, and he did not force them to go back.</p>
          <p>This was a merry Christmas-time to these four boys.
They had been accustomed to severity before, and had
lived on poor and scanty fare. Yet even their old
master, heartless as he seemed, was not systematic in
his cruelty. When he went down town in the morning,
there was none to watch them till he returned.
They could talk, and laugh, and sing; if they but finished
their tasks, they had little to fear.</p>
          <p>But, at Norton's shop, there was scarcely a minute
of the day that evil eyes were not upon them. Not a
laugh, a gesture, or grimace, but was remembered
and quoted as a token of disrespect to the lofty master,
who could ill brook a jest reflecting on his dignity.</p>

          <pb id="pickard56" n="56"/>
          <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
          <head>THE SEPARATION.</head>
          <p>IN the fall of this year (1817), the community of
which old Nattie Gist was the centre and the head
became greatly agitated.</p>
          <p>The old man had two nephews, Levi and Andrew
Gist, of whom he was very fond. They were both
sons of his brother William, who resided on a farm
few miles out of town.</p>
          <p>These young men, after much discussion, and not
withstanding some opposition from their friends, determined
to seek their fortunes in Alabama. They had heard tempting
reports of the fertility of the valley
of the Tennessee, and of the ease with which a fortune
could be made by raising cotton; and besides, they
were Kentuckians, and loved adventure.</p>
          <p>Their uncle liked the spirit of enterprize that impelled
them; he liked money too, and he foresaw that
they would have fine opportunities in that new country,
of amassing wealth.</p>
          <p>Levi Gist, the elder of the two brothers, had always been
a special favorite with his uncle, and to him he
intrusted six of his negroes. These he was to take
with him to Alabama, to assist him in putting up his
first crop. The old man promised to go himself the
<pb id="pickard57" n="57"/>
next year, if they should like the country, and decide
to settle there.</p>
          <p>The command to prepare to go with Master Levi,
fell with crushing weight upon the hearts of the doomed
slaves. Old Frank and his wife Peggy were the first
to learn their sentence. They were indignant at the
word. Long and weary had they toiled in their
master's service. Patiently had they endured hunger.
Stripes and cursings had been their frequent portion,
And these they had learned to receive without complaint.
Now they were growing aged and to be torn
from the old place, and from all the friends in whose
society the Sundays passed so pleasantly, seemed too
hard a trial.</p>
          <p>Their two children were to go with them. That
was some comfort, but a deeper sorrow, for they
would be forced to work in those great cotton fields,
where<sic corr="venomous"> venemous</sic> snakes would hiss at them, and cruel overseers
watch their toil.</p>
          <p>Yet old Frank and Peggy had not the deepest cause
for grief. Levin and Alfred were destined to accompany
them, and they must each leave behind his
brother, dearer to him than life itself.</p>
          <p>The young men intended to take with them every
thing that would be needed to stock a new plantation.
To collect and arrange in travelling order all their
goods, required much time and labor, and every hand,
at home, and at their uncle's, was enlisted in their
service.</p>
          <p>At Master Nattie's, particularly, all was now excitement
and confusion. The old man hurried to and fro,
administering curses and stripe's to all who failed to
execute his plans. The boys who had been hired out,
<pb id="pickard58" n="58"/>
were brought home to aid in these unusual labors, and
thus the brothers, that must so soon be separated, were
allowed to spend the last few days in each others
society.</p>
          <p>The thought that his brother must go to the South
was agony to Peter. In all their sorrows, thus far,
they had been together. They had shared the same
little pleasures—their hearts had been as one. And
now, to be sundered so wide—could they live apart?</p>
          <p>“O Levin, Levin! if they take, you 'way off there,
I sha'nt never see you no more, sure!”</p>
          <p>“O yes,” sobbed Levin, his heart almost broken,
while yet he strove to speak cheeringly to his weeping
brother—“O yes, Mars Nattie say he gwine bring ye
all next year when he come.”</p>
          <p>“Mars Nattie! He never gwine 'way off there!
He'll stay here long as he can get breath enough to
curse. He's too old to go to a new country, any how.”</p>
          <p>“Well, he have to die some day—he can't live a
mons's long time, sure.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, and if he dies, we'll all be sold—they allers
has an auction when folks dies—and then their people's
scattered all about. O 'pears like 'taint no use livin'
in this yer world. I sha'n't never see you no more!”</p>
          <p>The preparations for the journey were at last completed,
and one pleasant afternoon in October, the little
company of slaves had orders to repair to Master
William's, in order to be ready to start with their
young masters the next morning.</p>
          <p>“Mars Nattie,” said Levin, as they were all assembled
in the yard to say good-bye, “please, sir, give me
something 'fore I go, to 'member you by.”</p>
          <p>“Well,” said the old man, “go in and bring me the
<pb id="pickard59" n="59"/>
cowhide, and I'll give you something you'll never
forget. If I should give you a coat or a shirt, you
would wear it right out, but if I cut your skin to pieces,
you will remember this parting as long as you live.
And mind, you rascal, when I come out next fall, I'll
bring the cowhide, and if you don't behave yourself, I'll
give you enough then—d'ye hear?”</p>
          <p>Such, interspersed with numerous curses, was the
kind farewell of old Nattie Gist. The servants all
shook hands, and strove to speak in cheering tones to
their departing friends; but great tears stood in their
eyes as they watched the little company slowly marching
down the hill.</p>
          <p>Sadly they returned to their work, but their thoughts
crept on toward the dim future. Which of them
should go next? Master Nattie had sold, during the
past year, more than half his servants; and none
could tell what caprice might seize him before another
year should pass. They might all be chained in a
gang, and driven away by some barbarous trader.
Heavily throbbed their hearts as these gloomy fancies
floated before them; and while they tried to repress
the tears that <hi rend="italics">would </hi>scald their aching eye-balls, they
pursued their task in silence.</p>
          <p>Peter returned no more to his work at Mr. Hudson
Martin's, where he had spent the former part of the
year, but was sent by his master to take Levin's place
as waiter at Mr. John D. Young's.</p>
          <p>Mr. Young was not a rich man—indeed he had
failed in business, and now inhabited a small brick
house on the plantation of his father-in-law. He was
an intelligent gentleman, of pleasant manners, and
great kindliness of heart. Had his wife resembled him
<pb id="pickard60" n="60"/>
in amiability and gentleness, their home would have
been happy; but she was unfortunately destitute of that
true independence and dignity of character, that can
meet worldly reverses with composure. She felt
humiliated by their comparative poverty, and the comforts
with which she was surrounded looked hateful in
her eyes, because the splendors wealth might purchase,
were beyond her reach. Her servants endured most
in consequence of this unfortunate peculiarity. From
morning till night they were scolded, till they came to
heed the shrill voice of their mistress, no more than
they would heed the rain-drops on the roof.</p>
          <p>During the few months which Peter spent in the
service of Mr. Young, he passed many pleasant hours
at Mr.Clay's. His childish fear of the great statesman
had changed to deepest reverence; and, though young
masters Theodore and Thomas Clay, no longer played,
as had been their childish custom, with their colored
favorite, they treated him ever with perfect kindness.</p>
          <p>But with the servants, every one of whom was privileged
beyond the common lot of slaves, he was always
at home; and many a pleasant winter evening did he
spend at Ashland.</p>
          <p>Among the slaves that gathered there at night, one
of the merriest was Aaron the coachman. He was the
father of Mr. Clay's body servant, Charles, who, during
the last years of his master's life, was ever at his side.</p>
          <p>Aaron was an excellent servant—quick and energetic,
and his. mirthfulness and genuine good feeling
rendered him a favorite with all; while his stories,
songs and merry jests, made the warm kitchen ring
again.</p>
          <p>But he had one fault. He loved a dram, and when
<pb id="pickard61" n="61"/>
tempted by the sight or smell of his favorite liquor,
he could seldom resist the entreaties of his appetite.</p>
          <p>This weakness was peculiarly annoying to Mrs. Clay,
as it frequently unfitted him for business at a time
when she had most need of his services.</p>
          <p>He one day drove her carriage into town, and while
she was making a visit, he improved the opportunity
to indulge in a glass of his loved beverage; and by the
time his mistress was ready to go home, he was wholly
incapable of driving her carriage.
She was, therefore, obliged to hire a man to take his
place, and she then resolved that Aaron should be
punished. But it could not be done without Mr. Clay's
consent, as the overseer was forbidden to strike one of
the house servants, without consulting him.</p>
          <p>So to her husband she recited the story of her mortification,
and, as he had tired various mild means to
cure the slave of this unlucky propensity, he decided
that it was best to use more severe measures.</p>
          <p>The next morning he sent for the overseer, and
directed him to take Aaron into the carriage-house,
and give him a slight whipping. “Now do it quietly,”
said he, “and be sure not to cut his skin. I don't
want to hear any disturbance. Do it as gently as
possible.”</p>
          <p>The overseer respectfully assented and went out.
Instantly one of the maids, who had chanced to overhear
this conversation, stole out of the house, and
sought Aaron.</p>
          <p>“Look yer,” said she, “you know what massa say?”</p>
          <p>“Know what massa say? No! How I know
what he say, when he never spoke to me this
mornin'?”</p>
          <pb id="pickard62" n="62"/>
          <p>“Well, he say to the overseer—‘Aaron must be
punish—for he take a dram when Mrs. Clay want him
to drive for her—you may take him to the carriage-house
and whip him, but don't cut him up.’ ”</p>
          <p>“Don't cut him up! Massa say so? Well, well,
reckon this chile be ready. Overseer mighty good—
he talk so clever—'pears like he thinks I's white
sometimes, but the devil in his eye<corr>.</corr> He done wanted, this
long time, get a cut at me. I knows what overseers
means when they gets too good. Yah! yah! he thinks
now his gwine give this chile all he owes him.”</p>
          <p>The girl's astonished eyes followed Aaron as he
leaped over the fence, and ran toward a small grocery
that stood at a short distance on the road to town.
Here he had no difficulty in procuring a dram; and,
having thus fitted himself for the anticipated contest,
he walked home, and resumed his work.</p>
          <p>Soon the overseer called from the carriage-house
door—Aaron!”</p>
          <p>“Sir?”</p>
          <p>“Come here.”</p>
          <p>In a moment the slave stood before him.</p>
          <p>“Aaron, Mr. Clay says you must come into the
carriage-house and be whipped.”</p>
          <p>“Did Massa say so?”</p>
          <p>“Yes—he says your habit of drinking annoys your
mistress so often, that you must be punished for it.
He says he has tried to persuade you to leave it off,
but it does no good. I don't like to whip you, Aaron,
but it is Mr. Clay's orders.”</p>
          <p>“Well, if Massa says so, then it must be so,” and he
walked quietly into the carriage-house, followed by his
<pb id="pickard63" n="63"/>
<hi rend="italics">kind friend</hi>, the overseer, who fastened the door on the
inside.</p>
          <p>“Now, Mr.—,” said Aaron, “you may whip me,
if Massa says so, but you needn't tie me—I wont be
tied.”</p>
          <p>“Very well,” replied the overseer, throwing down
the rope which he had in his hand, “you needn't be
tied, if you will stand still; but you must take off your
coat.”</p>
          <p>“Yes sir; but if I take off my coat to be whipped,
you ought to take yourn off first to whip me.”</p>
          <p>The man perceived that he had been drinking, and
knew he must indulge his whim, if he would obey Mr.
Clay's orders to <hi rend="italics">keep quiet</hi>—so he pulled off his coat,
and Aaron quickly laid his beside it on the floor.
Then followed the vest—the slave insisting that Mr.—
should first remove his own. “Now your shirt,
Aaron,” said he.</p>
          <p>“Yes sir, but you must take off yourn first.”</p>
          <p>This was going further, for quiet's sake, than the
overseer had intended; but he hesitated only a moment.
It would be best, he thought, to humor him.
He had, in truth, long wished for a chance to humble
Aaron, and now the time had come.</p>
          <p>But, behold! no sooner had he lifted his arms to
pull his shirt over his head, than Aaron seized the
garment, and twisting it around his neck, held him
fast. Then catching the whip, he applied it vigorously
to the overseer's naked back, raising the skin at every
stroke. His victim screamed, and threatened him with
vengeance, but all in vain; the blows fell hard and
fast.</p>
          <p>Mr. Clay heard the out cry, and grew very angry.</p>
          <pb id="pickard64" n="64"/>
          <p>“I told him,” said he, “to make no noise, and to be sure not
to whip the poor fellow severely. He must be cutting him to
pieces.”</p>
          <p>He hastened to the carriage-house. The door was
fastened within, but he could hear the whizzing of the whip,
as it descended on the sufferer's back. “Open the door!”
he cried. “Didn't I tell you not to whip him hard? Open the
door, I say!<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“O, Mr. Clay! it's Aaron whipping me! I haven't given
him a blow.”</p>
          <p>“Aaron,” cried the master, “open the door.”</p>
          <p>Instantly the slave obeyed. With his right hand, in which
he still held the whip that he had used to such good purpose,
he opened the door, while with his left he retained his vice-like
grasp of the twisted shirt. His face was all
complacency, yet his eyes twinkled with mirth, and a roguish
smile lurked at the corner of his mouth.</p>
          <p>Mr. Clay stood for a few moments mute with
astonishment. But when he fully comprehended the strange
scene, he burst into a hearty laugh, and although the
overseer, as soon as he was released, proceeded to explain
to him the manner in which he had been caught, and insisted
that he should now be allowed to whip Aaron, his arguments
were lost. The master quietly expressed his opinion that
there <hi rend="italics">had been whipping, enough</hi>—it was not necessary
to go any further.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
          <head>MASTER NATTIE'S DEATH.</head>
          <p>IN April, 1818, Mr. Young having no further need of
Peter's services, Master Nattie sent him to his brother,
William Gist, to be employed on his plantation. Here Allison
was his companion once more, and the pleasure of being
together was in part, a compensation to each for the
absence of his brother.</p>
          <p>But this joy was transient. Early in the ensuing summer,
young Master Andrew came from Alabama for a short visit.
He brought news of the health and prosperity of those who
had gone with him the year before, and gave glowing
descriptions of the beauty of the country. The rich bottom
lands, with their grand old trees, the clustering vines and
graceful flowering shrubs, and, above all, the abundance of
game in the forests, afforded exhaustless topics of
discourse.</p>
          <p>When he returned, he took Allison with him.</p>
          <p>Peter was left all alone, and his heart was very
heavy. There was no one now to whom he could
communicate all his little trials; none that would sympathize
with his griefs. He had nothing but work to
divert his thoughts during the day; and at night his
dreams, sleeping or waking, were all of that dear
<pb id="pickard66" n="66"/>
brother, that had for so many years trod by his side
the rugged path to which they two were doomed.</p>
          <p>Soon after the departure of his nephew, Master
Nattie's health was observed to fail; and though for a
long time he struggled against disease, and would not
own that he was ill, yet he was at last obliged to yield.
His constitution was worn out by intemperance and
the indulgence of evil passions; and now, no medicine
could retard the steady approach of the Death Angel.</p>
          <p>Twice a week, during the summer, Peter was accustomed
to go to market. Then he never failed to visit
his old master; and as he saw his sunken eye and
hollow cheek, and noted his vacant wandering stare,
his heart sank within him.</p>
          <p>He did not regard his master with affection. Who
could love old Nattie Gist? But the sale, ah! if he
should die, there would, of course, be an auction, and
the traders would be there, and then, adieu to the last
hope he had cherished, of one day joining his beloved
brother.</p>
          <p>The unhappy old man continued to fail. Death
stays not at the behest of kings or generals how then
should the faint prayer of a poor slave-boy impede his
progress?</p>
          <p>In loneliness and gloom passed the last days of the
wretched man. His housekeeper and cook, Aunt
Mary, was his constant nurse. She understood all his
wants, and she had learned patiently to bear all his
caprices. Her will—her very womanhood—had been
crushed into submission to his authority; for though a
slave called her his wife, she had for years been forced
to disregard her marriage ties, as well as her own
<pb id="pickard67" n="67"/>
honor, in order to indulge the base passions of the
tyrant.</p>
          <p>Now, in the death-hour, the down-trodden woman
moistened his parched lips, all heedless of the curses
which they uttered. Her hand smoothed his pillow,
administered his medicine, and surrounded him with
all possible comforts.</p>
          <p>Death advanced. On Saturday morning, the thirteenth
of September, when, according to his custom,
Peter went in to see him, the final struggle had commenced.
His brother William and the doctor were
standing by the bed. Silently they witnessed his
agony as he strove with the King of Terrors. There
was no light of Christian hope in his glazing eye, no
love in his obdurate heart. He would resist—he would
live! Why should he die? This world had been
gloomy. No love-light had shone upon his path—
no gentle hand had led him through the labyrinths of
evil to the Author of all good. And as his lips had
loved cursing, why should he look for blessings now?
Could he hope for a better life than he had chosen
here? Fearful was the frown upon his face as he was
forced to yield to the great Conqueror. He struggled
—groaned—gasped—he was gone.</p>
          <p>Silently they closed his eyes, and horror sat upon
every countenance.</p>
          <p>They buried him, and raised a stone to his memory.
Ah! he chose his own remembrancers! Poor Levin
and his fellows need no stone to tell them that a
monster lived.</p>
          <p>After the funeral Mr. Wm. Gist conveyed the greater
part of his brother's property to his place for safe
keeping. A will was found conveying to his favorite
<pb id="pickard68" n="68"/>
nephew, Levi Gist, the house and lot in Lexington, as well
as all the servants. Whatever money he possessed he left in
legacies to his other relatives.</p>
          <p>At the time of his death, Master Nattie owned but eleven
slaves—the six that went first to Alabama. Aunt Mary, with
her two sons, and Allison and Peter. The others he had sold
some time before.</p>
          <p>Aunt Mary was left in town to take care of the house, till
young master Levi should come to take possession of his
property. As she went through the familiar rooms, and
arranged and re-arranged the furniture, she had time to
think. The past rose before her—the dark repulsive past. She
bad been young, but it was so long ago—it was hardly worth
her while to think of all the hopes that cheered her youth.
She was married—and her husband's love shone for a brief
time on her pathway; too soon, alas! to be shadowed by the
dark passions of her absolute master. Two babes had
nestled on her bosom, and they, too, were branded with her
humiliation.</p>
          <p>Now, <hi rend="italics">he</hi> was dead—he would curse her life no longer. Ha!
what a pang came with that half-uttered gratulation!
Dead—and she who had served him so faithfully—who had
meekly borne his wrathful curses, and patiently endured the
degradation to which he had reduced her—she to whom he
was indebted for all the comfort his home had known for
years—who had attended him by day and night till the grave
closed above his head—<hi rend="italics">she was coolly given to his
nephew</hi>, to be transported hundreds of miles away. How
her great eyes flashed at the thought, as, with her hand
upraised, in the solitary room where her master died, she
swore she would not go!</p>
          <pb id="pickard69" n="69"/>
          <p>Her husband, a native African, named Sam, who still
spoke but broken English, was soon to be free, according to
contract with his importer. Sam had the spirit of a prince.
To live always as a slave he would not consent; and, lest he
should kill himself or his master, his liberty was promised
him at a stipulated time.</p>
          <p>Mary was fully determined that she would never leave
him nor Lexington; and when in the December following his
uncle's death, the young heir came from the South to
remove his goods, and desired Aunt Mary to prepare for the
journey, she revolted. They might kill her, she said, but she
would not go—she indeed, would hang herself, and that
would end it.</p>
          <p>The young man coaxed, and threatened, but in vain.
She liked Mars Levi—everybody liked him—a heap
better than old Massa; but as to leaving “Kaintucky,”
and going away to the South, she could not.</p>
          <p>At last, finding that it was useless to attempt to remove
her, Master Levi sold her, with her two boys, to his father,—
and she was left to spend the evening of her days in her
beloved Lexington.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
          <head>THE JOURNEY TO ALABAMA.</head>
          <p>On a cold Sabbath morning, December 20,1818,
Peter started with Master John Gist, a younger brother
of “Mars Levi,” for his new home in Alabama.</p>
          <p>He wore his old master's broad-brimmed hat, and
had his shot-gun lashed upon his back. Miss 'Maltha,
the youngest daughter of Master William, came out
just as they started, and with a kind smile gave him a
handful of biscuits. Heaven bless her for the kindly
thought! The memory of that simple gift is still
warm in the heart of him who was then but a poor
slave-boy, going forth to meet his uncertain fortunes
amid scenes strange and new.</p>
          <p>The farewells were all said, and the young men rode
away—silently at first, for there were last words and
affectionate charges from his parents, still ringing in
the ears of Master John; and Peter's heart was full.</p>
          <p>He left Lexington with few regrets. It had never
seemed to him like home: though among the many
families in which he had served, there were some who
had treated him with great kindness. Yet the memory
of his mother haunted him, and a sense of injustice and
wrong, a consciousness that he had been stolen from
home, and that the power to which he had been forced
<pb id="pickard71" n="71"/>
to submit was all usurped, prevented his forming a
strong attachment to the place itself.</p>
          <p>Now he had little hope of ever seeing any of his
kindred except the dear brother that had gone before;
and his heart grew lighter, as hour by hour the distance
diminished between them. Alfred and Allison,
too, he soon should meet, and they were very dear to
him—for had they not suffered together?</p>
          <p>Then came a heavy sinking of the heart at the
thought, that he must thenceforth be exposed to all the
reputed hardships of the South. The constant toil in
the great cotton fields, the oppressive heat, the danger
of fearful sickness, and the deeper dread of cruel overseers
—all these fell upon his hopes like snow upon the
violets that have peeped out too soon.</p>
          <p>And oh! if after all these years his parents should
come in search of their children, and they both be
gone! No, no! he would not think of that—and
giving old master's riding-horse a smart cut with his whip,
he galloped on to overtake Master John.</p>
          <p>Hour after hour the youths rode side by side; now
conversing pleasantly about the country through which
they were passing, or reviewing little incidents connected
with their departure from home; and again,
their thoughts grew busy, and forgot to shape themselves
in words. Day after day they still rode on
one anticipating a pleasant visit with his brothers, and
a speedy return to all the endearments of a happy
home—the other, hopeful, and yet half afraid to meet
his destiny.</p>
          <p>They spent the nights at houses of entertainment,
which they found scattered here and there along the
roadside. At these, they were received more like
<pb id="pickard72" n="72"/>
family visitors than guests at a hotel. Master John sat in the
parlor by the blazing fire, and told the news from Lexington
to his kind host, or listened to the history of the last year's
crop. Peter, meanwhile, in the kitchen made himself no less
agreeable. He had come from town, and could tell wonders
to his less privileged auditors, who had seldom been out of
sight of home.</p>
          <p>The travellers arrived at Hopkinsville on Christmas
morning. Here dwelt Dr. William Teagarden, whose wife
was a maternal aunt of Master John, and at his house they
spent the holidays.</p>
          <p>This was a merry time. All the usual Christmas festivities
were enjoyed, and Mrs. Teagarden, in addition to these,
gave a large evening party in compliment to her nephew.</p>
          <p>Here Peter had a fine opportunity to display his skill and
grace as a waiter, and so highly pleased was Mrs.
Teagarden with his expertness in this vocation, that she
made several efforts during the next three years, to
purchase him of his young master.</p>
          <p>“Look yer, Peter,” said a gossiping old woman, who
stood among the other servants just outside the parlor-door,
and who had been watching the dancers with intense
interest, “your Mars John gwine fall in love wid dat young
lady, I reckon. How you like her for missus?”</p>
          <p>“What young lady you mean? I reckon Mars John ain't in
no hurry to fall in love, no how.”</p>
          <p>“Why, Miss Agnes Keats. Dar! he's leadin' her to a
cheer by her sister, Miss Frances. He's danced a'most all
night wid her, and 'pears like he thinks she's mighty perty.”</p>
          <pb id="pickard73" n="73"/>
          <p>“She is that,” said Peter, “does her father live about yer?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, he's a livin' now; but he come mons's nigh
gwine to de bad man where he 'longs. Didn't you
hear 'bout it in Lex'n'ton? He's got a heap o' people on dem
dar two big plantations, and he does 'em
mighty mean. But it wasn't none o' de field hands 'at killed
him.”</p>
          <p>“Killed him? You said he was a livin' now.”</p>
          <p>“So I did; but I'se gwine tell you how he kep'
clar. You see, he allers keeps three or four to de home
place to wait on de family—well, he was <hi rend="italics">dat mean</hi> dey
couldn't live in no sort o' fashion; so two big men what staid
round de house and garden, dey 'trive a plan to get enough
to' eat, for one day, least-ways. Dey got hold de gun, and
when de ole massa done got settle nice in his bed, dey ris de
gun up on de winder bottom, and pint it to his heart. But de
ole cook 'voman—she hope um, kase she fotch out de gun, an'
lef' de winder open; she got mighty skeered 'bout her
missus, and kep' tellin' 'em all de time dey's fixin' de gun,
‘Now min' you don't hit missus—keep it clar
o' missus.<corr>’ ”</corr></p>
          <p>“When dey got all fix, dey pull dat dar trigger—
Hi! didn't it pop? but it didn't kill de ole massa—
struck his ribs, I reckon. Well, de minute de ole cook
'voman year de gun, she lif' up her hands and fotch a
big scream. ‘O Lor'! I'll lay you's done kill missus, now!’ <corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“Every person on de place year dat yell, and all come a
runnin' to see who's kill.”</p>
          <p>“What 'come of the men?” asked Peter, his blood
chilled at the thought of the horrid deed.</p>
          <pb id="pickard74" n="74"/>
          <p>“De men—O dey's hung. Dey had a little court;
didn't take long to prove dey's guilty, kase you see
dey got cotch, so dey hung 'em mons's quick.”</p>
          <p>“Did they hang the 'oman, too?”</p>
          <p>“No, dey sol' her way off to de Coas'. Reckon she
won't never hope no more sich work as dat. 'Pears
like, it's mighty hard to have sich a mean massa as ole
Keats, but it's a heap wuss to try dis yer killin' business.
De Lor' don't low dat dar, no how.<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“Dar! dat set's up. Mars John gwine lead Miss
Agnes up for de nex'. How nice dat pa'r does look?”</p>
          <p>On the morning of the third of January, Master
John and Peter resumed their journey southward.
They spent one night at Nashville, and one at Columbia,
Tenn., and on the morning of the sixth, at eleven
o'clock, they reached Bainbridge.</p>
          <p>Peter's heart beat fast as he approached the spot that
was thenceforth to be his home. Everything he saw
looked strange and uncouth. The town, if such indeed
it might be called, consisted of about thirty small log
cabins, scattered here and there among the tall old
forest trees. Groups of white-haired, sallow-skinned
children were playing about the doors, or peeping
slyly at the strange gentleman as he passed. Now and
then, between the trees, were seen the bright waters
of the Tennessee, sparkling in the sunlight; but even
they pursued their pleasant way in silence, as if reluctant
to disturb the quiet of the place.</p>
          <p>“Well, Peter,” said Master John, “this is Bainbridge
—how do you like the looks of the place?”</p>
          <p>“Looks like 'taint a town, Mars John; I never
knowed folks have a town in the woods.”</p>
          <p>Oh! the woods will be gone in a few years. Don't
<pb id="pickard75" n="75"/>
you see, many of these trees are dead now? They
girdle them that way, and the next year they die.“</p>
          <p>“Whar's the store? Mars Levi say he got a store
yer.”</p>
          <p>“Yonder it is—where that gentleman is sitting on
the porch?”</p>
          <p>“That the store! Don't look no bigger'n a kitchen!
Whar Mars Levi live?”</p>
          <p>“Here we are at his house, now.” Master John
sprang to the ground, and gave his horse to Peter,
who with wondering eyes, was looking toward the
house.</p>
          <p>He could hardly believe that those two log cabins,
with an open passage between them, constituted Master
Levi's residence in Alabama. “Ha!” thought he,
“ole Mars Nattie say, they all gwine get rich out yer.
What he say now, if he see his young gentlemen
alivin' in a cabin in the woods among pore white
folks.”</p>
          <p>He followed Master John into the house. No one
was there. They went on to the kitchen, and with an
exclamation of joy, old Aunt Peggy ran forth to meet
them. “Mars Levi gone out huntin',” said she, “but
I reckon Mars Andrew in do store—he's dar mostly.
O, I's so glad to see somebody from de ole place!”</p>
          <p>“Dar Peter!” cried she, as the sound of wheels was
heard, “dar's my ole man with his wagon; he's gwine
to do mill whar de boys is all to work.”</p>
          <p>A moment more, and Peter was in the wagon beside
old Frank, hastening to the embrace of his brother
Levin. He could hardly wait to answer all the old
man's questions about home, and the dear friends <hi rend="italics">he</hi>
had left behind.</p>
          <pb id="pickard76" n="76"/>
          <p>Very joyful was the meeting between the brothers.
Few were the words they uttered—their hearts were
too full for speech. Alfred and Allison, too, were
there; the little group of true friends was once more
complete.</p>
          <p>After two weeks spent about the house, in assisting
Aunt Peggy to cook, and in forming a general acquaintance
with the premises, Peter was sent to the
cotton field.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="chapter">
          <pb id="pickard77" n="77"/>
          <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
          <head>FIRST FOUR YEARS IN THE SOUTH.</head>
          <p>HERE a new world opened before the young slave.
The brick-yards in which his boyhood was spent, the
fields of corn, tobacco, and hemp, around Lexington,
presented no picture that could equal this. Far away
stretched the brown plain, covered with the frosted
cotton shrubs. Here and there stood a girdled forest
tree, leafless and grim, yet mighty in its very desolateness.
Gloomily its wasted shadow fell across the pathway
trod by its destroyers, like the mysterious dread
of ill that ever haunts the footsteps of the guilty.</p>
          <p>The crop was now about half picked out. The business
was all new to Peter, and though it did not look
difficult, yet he worked diligently all day, and at night
had only twelve pounds and a half. The other boys
were greatly amused at his awkwardness, and played
many jokes upon him, telling him he must first break
off the boll, and then pick out the cotton.</p>
          <p>At night, when Master Andrew weighed the cotton,
he told them he would give a new pair of shoes to the
one who would pick fifty pounds the next day. Allison
was nearly barefoot, and he worked hard for the
prize, but in vain. Peter, however, had learned wisdom
from one day's failure, and, to the surprise of all,
<pb id="pickard78" n="78"/>
he had at night, seventy-five pounds. After this, he
was seldom excelled in the cotton field. His fingers
were long and nimble, and he could pluck the fleecy
treasure from the frost-browed boll almost without
effort.</p>
          <p>Bainbridge, though mainly settled by poor people,
who gained a scanty subsistence by hunting and fishing,
was at that time surrounded by the estates of wealthy
planters. Some of these were of good Virginia or
Carolina families, but more were ignorant and vulgar
men; overseers, or even negro traders, formerly, who
had gained wealth in these refined pursuits, and were
thereby entitled to stand in the ranks of the aristocracy
of North Alabama.</p>
          <p>The store of the Messrs. Gist was a favorite resort of
these neighboring planters. It contained not only the
usual assortment of dry goods, groceries, &amp;c., with
which country stores are usually supplied, but what
was more essential to the social enjoyment of the gentlemen
there congregated, excellent liquors of every
kind. There too, was the Post Office; and to the
patriots of Bainbridge there was never lack of interest
in the great subjects of politics, and—the cotton
market. Upon these they conversed day after day, as
they sat on the porch at the store door, and night after
night the discussions warmed, as the brandied flush
crept over cheek and brow of the staunch vindicators
of their different party chiefs. Sometimes, indeed the
arguments ran so high that the disputants went home
with visages slightly disfigured by contact with opposing
fists; but these wounds soon healed, and over a
bottle of good old wine, such trifling episodes were
quite forgotten.</p>
          <pb id="pickard79" n="79"/>
          <p>For two years, this little family quietly pursued the
regular avocations of the farm. They made excellent
crops in proportion to the number of hands employed;
and the business of the store was at the same time very
lucrative. The brothers bought and shipped cotton,
corn, and bacon, and kept for sale, at a good profit, all
kinds of goods that were required by their various
customers.</p>
          <p>During the winter the slaves had many opportunities
of earning pocket money. Flat-boats loaded with cotton,
while coming down the river, were frequently stove on
the rocks in the Muscle Shoals, at the foot of which Bainbridge
is situated. The cotton, becoming wet, was thus
rendered unfit for market, unless the bales were opened
and thoroughly dried. This furnished employment
for the negroes on Sundays. Carefully they spread
the damp cotton on boards or rocks in the sunshine,
turning and shaking it frequently till it was perfectly
dry, and fit to be repacked in bales for market. For
this labor, they sometimes received a dollar a day—
thus supplying themselves with the means of procuring
many little comforts.</p>
          <p>In the year 1821, Mr. Levi Gist bought a plantation
of four hundred and eighty acres, about seven miles
south of his home. He also built a large brick house
in Bainbridge, the lower story of which he intended
to occupy as a store. In the fall of this year, he removed
all his servants, except Peter, to the new plantation.
Him he retained to wait on himself, and on
the beautiful young bride whom he brought home in
December.</p>
          <p>This lady, whose generous and uniform kindness to
himself Peter still delights to remember, was Miss
<pb id="pickard80" n="80"/>
Thirmuthis Waters, formerly of Nashville. She had
come out to Alabama the previous spring with her
sister, Mrs. McKiernan, who, with her husband, had
settled on a plantation near that recently purchased by
Mr. Gist.</p>
          <p>Peter had now to perform the duties of cook, housemaid,
and waiter, there being no other servant in the
house, except a little boy about twelve years old, that
assisted him in performing some of the lighter labors.</p>
          <p>These were the brightest days that had ever fallen
to the lot of the young slave. His time was all occupied,
but he succeeded in performing his various duties
to the satisfaction of his mistress, and he felt not the
want of leisure. Her approving smile shed sunshine
on his lowly path and her gentle kindness filled his
heart with gratitude.</p>
          <p>Now, but for the one cloud that shadowed his spirit,
he would have enjoyed comparative content. But the
thought of his mother far away, who could never hear
from him, and whom now he might not hope to see,
isolated him, in some sense, from his companions in
bonds. It is true, that no intelligent slave can feel that
his thraldom is just, because his mother was, perforce,
a chattel; and yet, the knowledge that he was born a
slave, like those he sees around him, and the total
ignorance of a different structure of society, go far
to reconcile the unfortunate bondman to his lot.</p>
          <p>A few weeks after the wedding, Mr. Gist accompanied
his bride and her sister, Mrs. McKiernan, on a
visit to their friends in Nashville.</p>
          <p>The journey—one hundred and twenty miles—was
performed on horseback; and as the party rode away
through the woods on a fine January morning, they
<pb id="pickard81" n="81"/>
formed a beautiful group. Mr. Gist—a well-formed
Kentuckian—his fine brown features enlivened by
splendid black eyes, and glowing with health and
vigor, rode proudly at his lady's side. She was very
beautiful. Her large, dark eyes sparkled with animation,
and her tall, erect figure, and graceful dignity of
carriage, rendered her, in her husband's eyes, an embodiment
of womanly perfection.</p>
          <p>Near the fair bride rode her sister—a graceful, matronly
lady, several years her senior, whose slight
delicate figure presented a marked contrast to her own
queenly proportions.</p>
          <p>At the distance of a few paces followed Peter, and
while he gazed admiringly at the dear forms of his
young master and mistress, he was far from being forgetful
of his own fine points. He was now nearly
twenty-one and his pleasant, lively face, and obliging
manners, won him friends wherever he went. Then,
his new suit was very becoming, and he rode as fine a
horse as he could wish. Not one of the party was
better mounted.</p>
          <p>He was proud, too, of his young master, and determined,
in his own mind, that the Nashville folks should
be impressed with the dignity, and consequence of the
family into which Miss Thirmuthis had married.</p>
          <p>Swiftly flew the two weeks of their stay in Nashville.
Several parties were given to the young couple
by the family and friends of the bride, and before the
plans which their friends had formed for their pleasure
were half accomplished, the time that they had allotted
to the visit was spent, and they were obliged to set out
upon their return.</p>
          <p>At the age of twenty-one, Peter began to think
<pb id="pickard82" n="82"/>
more seriously than he had ever thought before, of
establishing a character for life. He saw the moral
degradation that prevailed among those of his own
color, and he could not but discover that many of their
masters failed to keep themselves pure. The vulgar
and blasphemous oath, the obscene jest, and the harsh
tone of angry passion, he often heard proceeding from
the lips of <hi rend="italics">gentlemen</hi>;—yes, even the low jargon of
drunkenness was not seldom uttered by the lordly
master of scores of crouching slaves.</p>
          <p>All this the young man saw, and heard—and
loathed; and now that he had reached the age of
manhood, he resolved to shun the insidious advances
of every vice. He abandoned the use of tobacco,
which he had commenced when but a boy; and though
he had sometimes taken a dram with his companions,
he determined that he would thenceforth touch no intoxicating
drink. Thereafter, profanity dwelt not upon
his lips, and falsehood was a stranger to his tongue.
His character for integrity and honesty became firmly
established, and though but a slave, he won the entire
confidence of all with whom he was connected.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref2" n="2" rend="sc" target="note2">* </ref></p>

knowledge; having been acquainted with him for several
years of his slave-life in Alabama.</p>
          </note>
          <p>With these noble resolves of his opening manhood,
came ardent desires for freedom. He reviewed his
past life—there was nothing there—in feeling, thought,
or act—that proved him unfit for liberty. The curse
of slavery had embittered his heart, and with every
power of his soul aroused, he resolved that he would
struggle to escape it. By flight or purchase—<hi rend="italics">some</hi>
<pb id="pickard83" n="83"/>
<hi rend="italics">means must offer</hi>—he would yet win back his human
birthright.</p>
          <p>With this goal of all his hopes, somewhere in the
hidden future, he pursued his daily round of humble
duties—patiently waiting till he should perceive some
opening in the dense, dark cloud that enveloped his
fate.</p>
          <p>In October, 1822, Mr. Gist relinquished his share in
the store to his brother, who had been his partner;
and removing to the plantation, devoted his whole
attention to agricultural pursuits.</p>
          <p>Here they lived in true Southern country style.
The “great house” on the plantation consisted of two
cabins, built of hewn logs, and whitewashed within and
without with lime. A covered passage connected the
rooms, over each of which was a small, low chamber.
A log kitchen and smoke-house in the rear, with the
usual potato-house, saddle-house, and other small, shed-like
buildings, each appropriated to the shelter of a
single article or class, completed the establishment.</p>
          <p>At dawn of day, the master was up and away with
his hounds to the woods, and woe to the unlucky fox
or rabbit whose trail they chanced to discover.</p>
          <p>The overseer, meantime, marshalled his forces; and
as there were so few hands on the plantation, he was,
by his contract with the master, obliged to take his
hoe and work with them.</p>
          <p>The domestic arrangement of the household was
perfect. The young mistress was fond of order and
regularity; and, through her kind and constant discipline,
those desirable qualities soon became manifest
in the habits of her servants.</p>
          <pb id="pickard84" n="84"/>
          <p>Thus, on the plantation of young master Levi, peace
and happiness established their dominion. One acquainted
with the neighborhood in which he lived,
would have pronounced his place an oasis in the desert—
a solitary star in a midnight sky.</p>

          <head>LEVIN'S MARRIAGE.</head>
          <p>IT is a pleasant Sabbath evening in early spring.
The air is filled with perfume from hosts of new made
flowers, and vocal with the merry notes of birds.</p>
          <p>Master Levi rises from his seat on the porch, and
walks slowly to and fro in the yard. He is stouter
and handsomer than he was two years ago when he
came out on the farm to live. Aye, and happier too;
for the lovely little Mary, that stretches out her tiny
hands towards her papa, and sweetly lisps his name,
has unsealed a new fountain of joy in his bosom.</p>
          <p>Yes, he is happy and prosperous. His crops all
look well, and his negroes are healthy and obedient.</p>
          <p>“O mass'r!” says a voice at his side. He turns. It
is Levin. He has grown tall and manly since we remarked
him last—of course, for he is now about
twenty-five years old, and a fine stout follow.</p>
          <p>“Well, Levin, what do you want?” responds the
master. “What is the matter?”</p>
          <p>“O, nuthin's the matter, sir; only I wanted to ax
you if you's willin' I should get married, sir.”</p>
          <p>“Get married? Why, yes—you're old enough, I
suppose—over twenty, aren't you?<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“Yes, sir, I's twenty-five.”</p>
          <pb id="pickard86" n="86"/>
          <p>“Well, where's the girl you want to marry? You can
have a wife as soon as you wish, if you will get one of the
right sort.”</p>
          <p>“I wants Fanny Hogun, sir; and ole Mars Jimmy, he
say I may have her if you's willin', sir.”</p>
          <p>“Fanny Hogun! Old Jimmy Hogun's Fanny! The very
worst place in the neighborhood for a fellow to be running!
Fanny—let me see—her mother's Linsey, old Jimmy's
housekeeper—a regular she-devil. What put into your
stupid head to go there to hunt for a wife? No, you can't
have Fanny. You may have a wife, and welcome; but no
boy of mine shall be spending his nights and Sundays at
old Jimmy Hogun's—d'ye hear?”</p>
          <p>“But, mass'r, Fanny's a good girl, and 'pears like 'twont
do no hurt to go and see her, sir. I don't want nary nother
wife, sir.”</p>
          <p>“But I tell you, Levin, I can't let one of my boys have a
wife at such a place as that. So don't talk any more about
it. You can hunt up another girl that will suit you better.”</p>
          <p>Poor Levin walked away. He was sadly disappointed.
He knew his master had good cause for disliking to have
his people associate with old Jimmy Hogun's negroes; but
he and Fanny loved each other so dearly that he could not
give her up.</p>
          <p>Mr. James Hogun was a bachelor—an eccentric man—
silent and unsociable. He was seldom seen from home,
even within the circle of his own family connections.</p>
          <p>But though as an individual, he was little known, his
place was famed in all the country around as the scene of
most disgraceful proceedings. No white
<pb id="pickard87" n="87"/>
woman inhabited the premises, but many beautiful slave
girls embellished his demesne. Here “patrollers” and other
wild and reckless characters were wont to resort at night,
and, free from all restraint, to give the rein to every evil
passion.</p>
          <p>All this was well known to Levin—but Fanny, he was
sure, was not like her companions. She was good and true,
and she loved him.</p>
          <p>He disliked exceedingly to offend his master who had
always been so kind to him, and yet he could not decide to
sacrifice his deepest, truest affection. For some time he
hesitated, but at last love conquered; and without the
approbation of his master, he took the lively Fanny for his
wife.</p>
          <p>Mr. and Mrs. Gist were both displeased. They had
reasoned with Levin, and sought by every kind method to
dissuade him from this measure, and his disobedience
gave them real pain.</p>
          <p>Levin had hoped that, once married, all his troubles
would be past, but he soon ascertained that they had but
just commenced.</p>
          <p>He could seldom go to see his wife, for the overseer,
aware that his master was opposed to his going, placed
every possible impediment in his way. Once, indeed, he
went so far, the day after one of these stolen visits, as to
strip him and tie him up, intending to whip him well. The
master, however, forbade the execution of this design, and
the disappointed ruffian could only avenge his wounded
pride by crushing his intended victim with heaps of curses.</p>
          <p>But when Fanny dared to come to see her husband, she
was under no such friendly protection. In vain Levin
begged that she might be spared, and threatened
<pb id="pickard88" n="88"/>
to tell his master. The overseer knew that Mr. Gist
did not favor her visits, and as he seldom had an opportunity
to exercise his disciplinary talents, now—
“<hi rend="italics">Gist was so devilish careful of his niggers</hi>”—he could
ill afford to lose such opportunities for sport.</p>
          <p>Soon after his marriage, Levin's health failed, and
he became unable to continue his labors in the field.
He could, however, do light work, and his mistress
took him into the house.</p>
          <p>His master now renewed his efforts to persuade him
to refrain from visiting his wife, but all in vain. His
love for Fanny was warm and true, and no argument
could move him.</p>
          <p>Mr. Gist's patience at length gave way. His anger
rose. He would not thus be baffled by a servant—he
would force him to obey his wishes! He accordingly
bound the astonished slave, and whipped him severely.
Three hundred and seventeen lashes fell upon his
naked back.</p>
          <p>A little later, and the master's passion had subsided.
He was astonished at himself. Remorse and bitter
sorrow filled his heart; and with his own brave frankness
he confessed—even to the victim of his wrath—
that he had done a grievous wrong. “I have acted
hastily,” said he, “while in a passion, and I am very
sorry.”</p>
          <p>After this no force was used to prevent the intercourse
of the true-hearted pair, but they were permitted
peaceably to enjoy their transient visits to each
other.</p>

          <pb id="pickard89" n="89"/>
          <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
          <head>VINA'S EARLY HISTORY.</head>
          <p>IN Edgecombe county, N. C., about seven miles from
Tarboro', lived a respectable planter, named William
Foxall. He was handsome in person, and in manners
most agreeable; a kind master, and a true-hearted friend.</p>
          <p>At the time of which we speak—1817—he was a
widower with two children. The eldest, a lovely and
accomplished young lady, named Mary Ann, the fruit of
his first marriage, resided with her father; but the little
boy, a final parting gift from his last wife, was adopted
by her grandmother immediately after her daughter's
death.</p>
          <p>Mr. Foxall was not a wealthy man; indeed he had never
been ambitious to accumulate great riches. He had
chosen rather to live in the enjoyment of the competency
bequeathed him by his ancestors, and to leave it,
together with an untarnished name, as an inheritance to
his children.</p>
          <p>But the quiet he had chosen was destined to be
interrupted by the entreaties of an old schoolmate,
who had resided for a few years in Lawrence county,
Alabama.</p>
          <p>This gentleman, whose name was Allen, wrote frequently
to Mr. Foxall, and always begged him to sell
<pb id="pickard90" n="90"/>
what he termed his meagre old plantation, and to come to
the Tennessee Valley. “Here,” said he, “you will find a
country beautiful by nature, and rich as beautiful. The soil
seems eager to yield its increase, and wealth waits but the
planter's bidding. Come to this charming valley, where,
with the forces now at our command, a few years' crops
will make you independent, and insure wealth to your
children after you are gone.”</p>
          <p>The alluring prospect tempted even the unambitious
Foxall; and he sold his old plantation, endeared as it was to
him by a thousand tender associations. His servants, old
and young, he resolved to take with him.</p>
          <p>Among these, there was one woman named Sally, who,
with her three children, properly belonged to his daughter;
she having been given to the first Mrs. Foxall on her
marriage.</p>
          <p>Sally was an excellent servant, and devotedly attached
to her young mistress. She had waited on her departed
mother when she too was a blooming maiden, and had
arrayed her in her bridal robes. All her cares and sorrows
she had shared; and when their beloved mistress was
passing away, she it was that smoothed the dying pillow,
and folded the meek hands to their long repose.</p>
          <p>Then the deep love of her nature was transferred to the
sweet infant left wholly to her care; and though when her
own children were born, a new fount of tenderness was
opened in her heart, it was scarce deeper than that which
had welled forth for the motherless babe she had
cherished.</p>
          <p>Her own poor children, alas! were now fatherless—
though <hi rend="italics">death</hi> had spared the husband of her love.</p>
          <pb id="pickard91" n="91"/>
          <p>His name was Silas; and his owner, a Mr. Sisson, lived a
few miles from Mr. Foxall's plantation. Silas was a
carpenter, a fine energetic fellow, and was highly
esteemed by his owner. He was also full of affection for
his wife and babes; and was unhappy only when by some
arrangement beyond his control, he was prevented from
enjoying their society at the stated season.</p>
          <p>When the youngest of his three children was but an
infant, a branch of the Sisson family removed to Alabama,
and as they would be obliged on arriving there to build
themselves a house, they took Silas with them.</p>
          <p>Sad was his heart when he came to say “Good bye” to
Sally and her little ones, but he was hopeful. He was not
<hi rend="italics">sold</hi>; and when the new house should be built in that
strange wild place where they were going, he could return.
They would not keep him there, away from all he loved—ah,
no!</p>
          <p>But a year passed, and no permission came for Silas to
return to the old place. He had been patient, but his
endurance could not last forever; and one night, when all
was still about the new house he had built, he rose up
quietly, and bade a silent farewell to the kind friends that
seemed so unwilling to let him go.</p>
          <p>He was not long in returning to his old home, and there
he spent one more happy year. His little children learned to
watch for his coming, and Sally's eyes regained their
wonted brilliancy.</p>
          <p>Ah! when he had ceased to fear, then was his danger
nearest. The man from whom he had fled came again, and
carried him away in heavy chains.</p>
          <p>Where he was conveyed, his wife knew not. Only once
more she saw his face. After she had for months deplored
his sad fate, he came to see her. Three days
<pb id="pickard92" n="92"/>
his “pass” allowed him to remain with her. How
swiftly did they pass?</p>
          <p>He had been working at his trade, he said, but they
were about to send him to the Potomac river, to be
employed upon a boat; and when he could come
again, he did not know.</p>
          <p>Never more did Sally's eye rest upon the form of
her husband; never more did his pleasant voice delight
her ear. Year after year she watched for his coming
her heart grew sick with waiting, and she knew
that she must give him up.</p>
          <p>At last, the news that the Foxall family was about
to remove to Alabama, reached his ears, and though
he could not visit his dear ones, he found an opportunity
to send them some little presents, as farewell tokens
of his love.</p>
          <p>The grandparents of Miss Foxall insisted that if her
father went to Alabama, she should remain with them.
That rude new country would be no place for her, destitute
as she was of a mother's care; and though Mr.
Foxall longed for her cheering presence, he felt that
they were right; and with a father's blessing, he left
his daughter to their guardianship.</p>
          <p>Sally, too, and her children, should have remained,
but he needed all his forces to make his first crop; and
as he promised to send them back when he should be
able to dispense with their services, his daughter and
her friends consented to his taking them.</p>
          <p>Sally's oldest child was named Jerry. He was a
fine healthy boy, nine years old. Lavinia, or Vina, as
she was usually called, was seven, and Quall, the
youngest, a bright merry boy, was nearly five. These
were the light of her eyes; and though she grieved at
<pb id="pickard93" n="93"/>
the thought of parting with her young mistress, and
wondered who would now perform for her all the little
services that had never yet been entrusted to less careful
hands than hers, yet she felt that, so long as she
could keep all her own children with her, she should
not repine.</p>
          <p>Dr. Allen, the friend who had urged Mr. Foxall's
emigration, was settled near Courtland, Lawrence
county. Here he had a fine plantation, and his friend
bought one adjoining. Then with the idea that they
could thus work their hands to better advantage, they
entered into partnership, working all the land together,
and sharing equally the profits.</p>
          <p>Year after year passed in his new home; yet the
bright visions of wealth that had enticed Mr. Foxall
thitherward, vanished into thin air.</p>
          <p>Not that his friend had exaggerated the fertility of
the soil, or any other of the peculiar natural advantages
of the beautiful valley in which he had settled. No;
the rich bottom lands near the river teemed with vegetation,
and the broad plains for miles back brought
forth abundant crops. Nature's work was all perfect;
and the laborers performed their duty well.</p>
          <p>Cotton was “made” and sold; and corn, in quantities
that astonished the Carolinians, who had all their
lives been accustomed to tilling a less prolific soil.</p>
          <p>Yet, notwithstanding all this apparent prosperity, the
coffers of the planters were not full; and as years passed
on, though crops were regularly gathered in and sold,
great debts accumulated, and ruin stared them in the
face.</p>
          <p>Ah, William Foxall! could you hope to grow rich,
<pb id="pickard94" n="94"/>
when your fortune was linked with that of a drunkard
and a gambler?</p>
          <p>With the cowardice characteristic of the votaries of
dissipation, Dr. Allen, when he saw that a crash was
inevitable, privately quitted the country, leaving his
partner to endure alone the consequences of his own
criminal self-indulgence, and to arrange the business as
he could.</p>
          <p>Poor Mr. Foxall was overcome with grief and humiliation.
The debts had been contracted by his partner,
but as his share of their wasted property was insufficient
to pay one-third of them, he was obliged to turn
out all his own. Even the trusting servants, more his
friends than slaves, that he had brought with him from
the dear old home, must go to satisfy the gambler's
creditors.</p>
          <p>Oh! what a wave of sorrow rushed over the spirits
of those doomed slaves, when they learned their destiny!
Even Sally and her children, who should have
been sent back to their young mistress, to whom of
right they still belonged, they, too, were given up.</p>
          <p>As many as could be sold at private sale were thus
disposed of. That was better than to be put up at
auction, where they might fall into the hands of traders,
and thus become so widely scattered that they could
never more hear from each other.</p>
          <p>Vina was the first of all the number to be sold. She
had been hired out as a nurse for two or three years,
and was now in the service of Mrs. Smith, at the hotel
in Courtland.</p>
          <p>It was Sunday morning, and Aunt Sally was coming
in that day from the plantation, to see her children.
<pb id="pickard95" n="95"/>
Vina had dressed the baby, and was just finishing the
arranging of her mistress' room, when Dr. P—, of
Courtland, entered.</p>
          <p>“Your name is Vina,” said he, “and you belong to
Mr. Foxall?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
          <p>“Well, I have bought you, and you must be ready
to go with me in an hour.”</p>
          <p>He left the room, and Vina gazed after him like
one bewildered. It was so sudden, only one hour,
and her mother had not yet come.</p>
          <p>She looked up the street. There was no one in
sight that cared for her. A thought struck her. She
would go and see her master, and learn from his own
lips her fate. She would beg him to let her stay till
her mother should come; she could not go away without
bidding her “Good-bye.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Foxall lived in the village, in a large brick
house, near the hotel. Thither the excited girl ran.
“Is Mass'r in the house?” asked she of the first servant
that she met.</p>
          <p>“I reckon so; I aint seen him gwine out.”</p>
          <p>But the master, well-nigh broken hearted at the necessity
of parting with his servants, could not be found.
Vina ran through the house, searching every room
that was unlocked. He had expected this, and he
could not bear to meet her, after he had sold her to a
stranger.</p>
          <p>The poor girl returned to the hotel. She had
learned from some of the servants that Dr. P. had not
bought her for himself; but that, being indebted to
Mr. McKiernan, of Franklin county, and his former
partner, Mr. Stout, of Nashville, he had, at their request,
<pb id="pickard96" n="96"/>
bought her and a young girl named Rosetta, for
them.</p>
          <p>With an aching heart, she stood watching for her
mother. There was no tear in her eye, and her features
were fixed and rigid. Ah Sally! Came there no
spirit-voice to thee, bidding thee hasten to thy child,
whose heart was breaking?</p>
          <p>“Ready, girl?” shouted a coarse voice. “Come!
can't wait. Bring along your traps, if you've got any,
but you can't take a big bundle, seein' there's two on
you to ride.”</p>
          <p>Vina gazed a moment at the speaker, an ill-looking
young man on horseback, and then, seeing that Rosetta
stood by his side, holding another horse by the bridle,
she silently picked up the little bundle she had prepared,
and went out. One long look she cast up the
street, with a faint hope that she might yet see her
mother's form approaching.</p>
          <p>That hope was vain. She saw many happy mothers
with their children, walking to the house of God; and
maidens of her own age tripped by, unconscious alike
of grief and care. No tearful pitying eye rested upon
<hi rend="italics">her</hi> face, no heart sighed at the utter desolation of <hi rend="italics">her</hi>
hopes.</p>
          <p>She mounted the horse mechanically, as one in a
dream; and Rosetta sprang up behind her.</p>
          <p>Silently, hour after hour, they followed their rough
guide. Now, blooming fields, on either side, smiled
on them as they passed; and then, their road crept
through thick gloomy woods, that hid the darkness in
their shadowy depths through all the bright Spring
days.</p>
        </div2>

          <pb id="pickard97" n="97"/>
          <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
          <head>VINA'S FIRST YEAR AT McKIERNAN'S.</head>
          <p>LATE in the evening, the two young maidens reached
their destination, and were conducted to the kitchen.
Bashfully they crept into the darkest corner, while curious
eyes stared at them from every side, and wondering
whispers passed from lip to lip.</p>
          <p>The cook alone seemed not surprised at the arrival
of the strangers, but with a wise look that well became
her elevated station, bade them come closer to the fire;
for “'Pears like,” said she, “de evenin's sort o' cold.
Missus 'll be home to-reckly; she went to Tuscumby
to church, to-day, wid her sister, Miss 'Muthis. Dar,
warm yerself, honey, you looks sort o' chilly like,”
continued the old woman, as she drew Rosetta towards
the blazing fire, at which she was preparing supper.</p>
          <p>Rosetta had left neither father nor mother behind,
and though she was sad at leaving her young companions,
and above all, her master, whom she almost
adored, yet these slight regrets soon subsided, and she
readily glided into conversation, with the new associates
to whom she had been so unceremoniously presented.
The iron had not entered her soul.</p>
          <p>But Vina crept further back into her shadowed
corner, where, heedless of the numerous visitors that
<pb id="pickard98" n="98"/>
love to assemble on Sunday evening in a planter's
kitchen, she yielded to the influence of her desponding
thoughts. Yet no tear moistened her eye-lid, no sob
gave vent to the choking anguish of her heart.</p>
          <p>“Missis come: say, bring in supper;” said a young
girl, appearing for a moment at the kitchen door.</p>
          <p>Supper was carried in, and, one by one, the dark
visitors to the kitchen went out; some to prepare their
own scant evening meals, and others to collect again
in little groups for confidential chat.</p>
          <p>“Hi! dem's nice gals in yon!” said the tallest in one
of those groups—a kind hearted fellow, that had
pitied the confusion of the young strangers.</p>
          <p>“Not over an' above nice, I reckon; dat little un's
sort o' fa'r, but t'other looks like she don't know
nuthin'. She aint much 'count, no how.”</p>
          <p>“You don't know 'bout dat dar, ” rejoined the first
speaker, “she mought 'a' lef '—her sweetheart—'way
yon'—pears like she feels mighty bad.”</p>
          <p>“Missus say, come in de house; she want to see
what ye all looks like;” cried the same young girl at
the kitchen door.</p>
          <p>“Dar, go 'long honey,” said the old cook, as she
drew Vina from the shaded corner, and placed her
beside Rosetta. “Hol' up yer heads now, children,
and look peart like when ye goes in to see Missus; go
'long.”</p>
          <p>“De Lor' help 'em, poor little critters,” sighed the
kind old woman, as she watched them from the
kitchen door, “dey's got a she wolf to deal wid now.
'Pears like dey aint used to hard times, no how, but
nobody cant say dat dar 'bout em, arter dey's done
staid on dis yer place one year.”</p>
          <pb id="pickard99" n="99"/>
          <p>Timidly the two girls advanced into the presence of
their future mistress. She fixed her keen cold eyes on
them for a moment, and then addressed herself to
Vina.</p>
          <p>“What can you do, girl?”</p>
          <p>“I's been used to nursin', ma'am, and waitin' in the
house.”</p>
          <p>“Did you never work in the field?”</p>
          <p>“No, ma'am.”</p>
          <p>“Ah! you've been raised quite a lady! Can you
<hi rend="italics">round corn</hi>?”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref3" n="3" rend="sc" target="note3">* </ref></p>
          <note id="note3" n="3" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref3">* Weeding around the hills.</note>
          <p>“I don't know what that is, ma'am.”</p>
          <p>“Can you <hi rend="italics">chop through cotton</hi>?”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref4" n="4" rend="sc" target="note4">†</ref></p>
          <note id="note4" n="4" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref4">†Thinning the cotton by removing all superfluous stalks, so as to

          <p>“No, ma'am.”</p>
          <p>“You're such a lady, I suppose you never saw any
cotton grow.”</p>
          <p>“Yes ma'am, I's seen a plenty of cotton a growin',
but I never worked it.”</p>
          <p>Mr. McKiernan then approached, and unfastening
her frock behind, examined her back. “Have you
ever been whipped?” asked he.</p>
          <p>“No, Sir.”</p>
          <p>“So I thought, your back is as smooth as mine.”</p>
          <p>He then proceeded to make a more minute examination
of her person, inspecting her limbs, to see whether
she were well-formed and sound.</p>
          <p>Rosetta then underwent a similar examination, and
the master and mistress both seeming satisfied, they
were dismissed.</p>
          <p>“See that you behave yourselves,” said the master,
<pb id="pickard100" n="100"/>
as they went out,—“if you do well, you'll find that we
shall be good to you.”</p>
          <p>Martha, the young girl before mentioned, accompanied
them back to the kitchen. “Your coat is unfastened,”
said Rosetta, as they went out, “stop a
minute till I button it.”</p>
          <p>“O no,” whispered Martha, “I can't have it fastened,
my back's so sore.”</p>
          <p>“What's the matter with your back?”</p>
          <p>“Why, whar missus cuts me up. She's allers a
beatin' me. O I wish I's dead!”</p>
          <p>The strangers exchanged mournful looks, but not
another word was spoken.</p>
          <p>After they went out, a consultation was held in
“Missus'” room, concerning the most profitable disposition
that could be made of the two girls. “Mr.Stout
will not be on for his till some time in the summer,”
said the mistress; “there will be time enough before
that to ascertain which will make the most valuable
servant; but it isn't best to let them know that either
of them is to go to Nashville. We will try them, and
keep the one that we like best.”</p>
          <p>They were both unaccustomed to field labor, and
after due consultation it was decided best to send
Martha out, and to keep both of the new ones for the
present in the house. Accordingly, the next morning,
Martha was sent to the field. She was glad of the exchange,
for she was not strong, and her mistress had
taxed her powers of endurance to the utmost. To Vina
was assigned the post of housemaid and waiter; and
Rosetta was installed as nurse of Bernard McKiernan,
Junior, then but a few months old.</p>
          <p>Mrs. McKiernan was much pleased with her two
<pb id="pickard101" n="101"/>
new maids, and with good reason, for they were quick
and careful, and attentive to all her instructions. Poor
Martha's bruised back had filled their hearts with
terror; and from the conversations of their fellow-servants
in the kitchen, they gained no impressions of their
new mistress that tended to dispel their fears.</p>
          <p>For three months the young girls quietly pursued
their monotonous round of daily duties; and thus far,
they had scarcely given occasion to their mistress for a
reproof.</p>
          <p>Rosetta had become quite happy and contented; but
poor Vina's heart pined for her mother. All night
she lay very still, wrapt in a blanket, on the floor of
her mistress' room, and wondered if her mother and
brothers had been sold, and wished she knew where
they had been carried. When she fell asleep, her heart
was wandering still through strange, lonely places, in
search of those whose forms, alas! she might never
more behold. But after all, they might be very near
her—Oh! if she could only hear who had bought
them!</p>
          <p>This perpetual anxiety could not fail to impair her
health. She lost all appetite for food; and though she
uttered no complaint, one could plainly see, by her
wasted figure, and by the look of melancholy that
never left her face, that she was wretched.</p>
          <p>One morning in June, as Mrs. McKiernan, according
to her custom, was making a tour of discovery
through the house, to be sure that everything was in
order, she chanced to spy a silver ladle in the kitchen,
that must have remained there since dinner-time of
the preceding day. It was the first instance of carelessness
or neglect that had occurred in Vina's department
<pb id="pickard102" n="102"/>
since she had been in the house; and with quick
anger, the mistress seized the cowhide.</p>
          <p>Vina had never in her life been whipped, except
when, for some childish fault, her mother had corrected
her; and now, when her mistress called her in an
angry tone, saying <hi rend="italics">she</hi> could make her remember to
take care of the silver, the thought of Martha's lacerated
back sent a shudder through her frame. But she did
not weep, nor beg for mercy.</p>
          <p>With her own fair hands the <hi rend="italics">delicate lady</hi> chastised
her trembling slave. She did it <hi rend="italics">very gently</hi>, for she
was not half as angry as she oftentimes became at
smaller provocations. Yet the blood oozed through
the bruised skin that was swelled in ridges across poor
Vina's back; and she imagined—ignorant creature that
she was—that she had been severely punished. Ah!
the day was coming, when she would designate such a
whipping as “<hi rend="italics">only a slight bresh.</hi>”</p>
          <p>From that morning, she determined, if possible, to
escape from the immediate jurisdiction of her mistress;
and soon after, seeing her master alone, she went to
him, and asked him if she might go to the field.</p>
          <p>“Why?” said he, “what the devil put that into
your head? You don't know anything about field
work, do you?”</p>
          <p>“No, Sir, but I reckon I could learn and I mought
as well take my chance in the field as to stay in the
house. But, please Sir, don't let missus know I axed
you.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, yes; well, I won't tell her. I'd like to have
you in the field, any how, for Martha's sickly, and not
much account. Go along now; I'll talk to your mistress
about it.”</p>
          <pb id="pickard103" n="103"/>
          <p>“Look here,” said he to his wife, soon after this conversation;
“Martha don't do much in the field; she<corr>'</corr>s sickly, you know, and she can't keep up with the
others. I reckon we'd better bring her back into the
house, and take Vina in her place. She seems to be
well and willing to work.”</p>
          <p>“Well,” replied the lady, in her characteristic asperity
of tone, “I'd rather have Vina in the house; but
if you can't manage Martha, send her in. I can make
her work; she will never conquer me with her sickly
complaining.”</p>
          <p>The next morning Vina went to the field, where,
though at first all was strange, she soon learned to
“round corn,” that being then the work in season.</p>
          <p>About midsummer, Mr. Stout came on from Nashville,
to see the girl that had been bought for him, and
to take her home.</p>
          <p>Both the girls were shown him. He seemed to
prefer Vina, but Mr. and Mrs. McKiernan both assured
him that as he wanted a house servant, it would be
much better for him to take Rosetta; for she was a
very bright girl, and was becoming every day more
useful. They could make Vina do very well in the
field, but she was exceedingly ignorant, and withal
quite deaf, so that it would be utterly impossible for
her to learn the duties of a waiter or a nurse.</p>
          <p>Mr. Stout, having been for many years a partner of
Mr. McKiernan in a carriage factory in Nashville, understood
his habits and principles of action. He had
also some idea of the prevailing characteristics of his
wife; and, suspecting that their advice was not entirely
disinterested, he improved an opportunity to go alone
to the field where the hands were all at work. He
<pb id="pickard104" n="104"/>
talked awhile with the head-man, Nelson, about the
weather and the crops; and then, noticing Vina at her
work, he carelessly asked the man what sort of a girl
she was.</p>
          <p>“Oh! she is a good hand, Sir, fus rate, Sir.”</p>
          <p>“Can she hear well?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Sir,” replied Nelson, with a puzzled look.</p>
          <p>“Your mistress told me she was right deaf.”</p>
          <p>“Well, call her, Sir, see if she can't hear. Yah!
yah! Dat little gal deaf.”</p>
          <p>“O, Vina!” said Mr. Stout. She looked up from
her work. “How do you get along, Vina? Would
you like to go and live with me?”</p>
          <p>“Whar you live, sir?”</p>
          <p>“I live in Nashville. Would you like to go there?”</p>
          <p>“Oh! I don't know, sir, I's fur enough from my
mother now. I reckon I don't never want to go no
furder.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Stout returned to the house. He saw the true
state of the case, but it would be of no use to <hi rend="italics">seem</hi> to
understand it; so when a few days after, he left for
home, he took Rosetta with him. She had no ties to
bind her here, and was well pleased with the idea of
living in Nashville; of which city she had heard glowing
descriptions from the old servants. They were
“raised” there, and still remembered the place with
true home-love.</p>
          <p>Towards the last of August, when the crop was laid
by, Vina, who still pined for her mother, received from
her master a “pass” to Courtland. She had some
clothes there, which she wished to get; and even if her
mother wore sold, she hoped at least to learn where she
had gone.</p>
          <pb id="pickard105" n="105"/>
          <p>She started on Thursday morning; and, as she rode
alone on horseback over the road that a few months
before had seemed so dark and lonely, the shadow that
ever since that day had rested on her heart, was lifted.
She was young; and Hope, though crushed and silent
long, revived again; and whispered in her fainting
spirit's ear, sweet promises of brighter days to come.</p>
          <p>It was noon when she reached Courtland. How
her heart beat as she rode up the familiar street!</p>
          <p>Soon her eager eyes rested on an old acquaintance,
and she inquired in trembling accents for her mother.</p>
          <p>“La! honey,” replied the old woman she had accosted,
“whar you been all dis time, and never knowed
yer mammy sol'? Mr. Peoples done bought her;
dat Peoples whar live off yon' east o' town 'bout four
mile. He got ole Moses and Jerry too; yer mammy's
mighty lucky—got sol' 'long o' her ole man, and one
o' her boys. Mr. Peoples mighty good massa too;
leastways so all de folks say whar lives out dar. But
yer mammy to Mr. Mosely's now. Mr. Peoples done
hire 'em all out for de balance o' dis year.”</p>
          <p>Vina could listen no longer. Her heart was throbbing
wildly; and tears, that despair had long forbid to
flow, were standing in her eyes. She turned her horse
in the direction of Mr. Mosely's;—he must not stop
to rest till she should arrive at that goal of all her
hopes—her mother's side.</p>
          <p>Aunt Sally was at work in the field, at a short distance
from the house, and little dreamed that she
should that day behold the daughter for a sight of
whose features she had so earnestly prayed.</p>
          <p>Vina left her horse at the house, and walked to the
field. She came very near the group of slaves at work
<pb id="pickard106" n="106"/>
before she was perceived. Suddenly her mother
raised her head:—“My, chile! my chile!” she cried,
as with uplifted hands and streaming eyes she ran to
meet her daughter, and pressed her closely to her breast.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Mosely had bidden Vina to tell her mother
that she might “have holiday” while she remained;
and when the first gush of emotion had subsided, they
walked together to the house.</p>
          <p>“O Vina!” said her mother, “how I did mourn
when I come to town dat Sunday, and you was gone.
I reckon I skeered 'em all a screamin' and takin' on.
I didn't know what to do, so I went right to mass'r.
He felt mighty bad too; but he say he can't hope it;
he's 'bliged, he say, sell every thing—and de Lord
knowed he wouldn't part wid his servants if dar was
any way for him to keep 'em. He cried a heap while
I was dar. O 'pears like, gentlemen mought keep out
o' debt when dey knows what trouble it 'll all come to
at las'. He couldn't tell me nuthin' 'bout de place
whar you done gone; all he said, he done sol' you
and Rosetta to Dr. T.; and he's gwine send one to a
gentleman in Franklin, and t'other to Nashville. O
Lord! how my heart did ache! and 'pears like it
never stop achin' 'till I see your blessed face. Is you
got a good mas'r and missus, chile?”</p>
          <p>“Not over and 'bove; but they 'aint troubled me
much yit. They's mighty tight on the rest. O how
some o' the people thar does git cut up! 'Pears like
they will kill 'em sometime.”</p>
          <p>“Poor chile! poor chile! May de good Lord keep
de wolves off o' your flesh! Der aint no way to live
wid dem kind, only to pray to do Lord to keep de
lions' mouths shut up.”</p>
          <pb id="pickard107" n="107"/>
          <p>Aunt Sally had married a man named Moses, since
she came to Alabama, and having been sold with him
and her oldest son, she felt that her lot was far better
than that of many of her companions. She possessed
a kind and grateful disposition, and her trust was in
the arm of her Redeemer. “We's poor critters in dis
yer world,” she would remark, “but dars a crown for
us yon', if we minds de word of de Lord, and keeps
patient to de end.”</p>
          <p>“Now,” said Aunt Sally, as they all sat round the
door, enjoying the cool air of evening, “if Quall only
knowed you was yer, Vina, and if mass'r could spare
him, we'd be altogether once more. Poor Quall!
mass'r say he gwine keep him; but I don't know—I
'spect I shall hear he's sol', too.”</p>
          <p>Swiftly passed the hours till Sunday; when, as her
“pass” specified, Vina must return. She lingered as
long as she dared, and when she <hi rend="italics">must</hi> go, and Jerry
had saddled her horse, and brought him to the door,
she tore herself from her mother's arms, sprang into
the saddle—and was gone.</p>
          <p>Vina returned safely to her master's house. The
old light came back to her eye, and the accustomed
elasticity to her step; and the old cook remarked that
little Vina had “gone mighty peart like since she tuck
dat dar jaunt to de ole place.”</p>

          <pb id="pickard108" n="108"/>
          <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
          <head>THE MARRIAGE.</head>
          <p>DURING the first months of Vina's residence at Mr.
McKiernan's, she formed no intimacies with her companions.
Her heart was too heavy to sympathize in
their transient griefs, or to join in the merry sports
with which they sought to enliven their brief intervals
of rest.</p>
          <p>Mr. Gist's plantation lay very near, indeed, the dwellings
were not more than a mile apart, and from the
near relationship of the two families, a greater intimacy
existed between the servants than is usual between the
slaves even of near neighbors.</p>
          <p>Peter was at this time a fine, cheerful fellow, in the
first fresh vigor of manhood; and, being a special
favorite with his mistress, he was always a welcome
visitor at the plantation of her brother-in-law. Mr.
and Mrs. McKiernan liked him, for he was always respectful
and obliging; and to their servants, his bright,
good-humored face brought ever a gleam of the heart's
sunshine.</p>
          <p>Even the lovely little Vina felt the genial influence
of his presence, and her shyness and reserve gradually
melted away in the warmth of his smiles. At the first
sight of the desolate stranger his heart was moved to
<pb id="pickard109" n="109"/>
pity; and, as he never failed to speak kindly to her,
she soon began to look for his coming, as a weary
watcher waits for the morning.</p>
          <p>Thus, week after week, and month after month,
grew and strengthened the sympathy between the
brave-hearted youth, and the timid, shrinking maiden;
and when Vina had been a year in her new home, they
had confessed their mutual love, and only waited for a
favorable opportunity to be united in marriage.</p>
          <p>True, Vina was but fifteen years old, but she was
very destitute and helpless, and there was none but
Peter to care for her.</p>
          <p>Her master and mistress were pleased to observe this
growing attachment. Mr. McKiernan had always
fancied Peter, and longed to own him; and, as he knew
it would be inconvenient for him to have a wife away
from home, he determined to encourage him to marry
Vina, that then he might perhaps be able to induce his
brother-in-law to sell him.</p>
          <p>To his master and mistress, Peter dreaded to communicate
his wishes. He had seen poor Levin's sufferings
in consequence of having formed a connection
which they did not approve; and he was conscious of
the difficulties that would attend his caring for a wife
on any neighboring plantation. His mistress always
wanted him at home. She depended on him; and he
knew that she would object to having his attention
diverted from her business by family cares of his own.</p>
          <p>Yet, while he understood all this, he felt that he
was, himself, a man. Was he not twenty-five years
old, and had he not a right to marry? Surely, when
he had waited for so many years upon his master's
family, without ever indulging a wish that could interrupt
<pb id="pickard110" n="110"/>
their pleasure, they might be content to spare him
now and then on a Sunday for the cultivation and enjoyment
of his own affections.</p>
          <p>Still he knew they would oppose him, and he could
not bear to vex them; so he postponed speaking to
them of his wishes till something should occur that
would naturally open the way for the communication.
Thus the matter was suspended, when, early in May,
Mr. and Mrs. Gist announced their intention of visiting
Lexington. They had for several years been talking
of going there, and had promised Peter that when
they went, he might drive the carriage. He had anticipated
much pleasure in the visit; and when, year
after year, circumstances had rendered its postponement
necessary, he had keenly felt the disappointment.</p>
          <p>But now, to the surprise of all, he did not wish to
go. “Not go!” cried his master, “I thought there
was nothing you would like so well!”</p>
          <p>“Well, so I would,” replied Peter, “but it's so long
now, that I'm 'feared everybody there done forgot me.
There would'nt be nobody glad to see me, no how.”</p>
          <p>“Well, well, then old man Frank can go—he'll not
want to be asked twice.”</p>
          <p>Uncle Frank was wild with delight at the intelligence
That Peter was to stay at home. There were so
many old friends there that he would be glad to see—
“yah! yah! Reckon all de folks in Lexington ain't
forgot ole Frank.”</p>
          <p>Mrs. Gist had a brother living near; and to him,
while he should be away, Mr. Gist entrusted the care
of his servants. The overseer was to be under his
authority; and no slave was to be whipped, or in any
way abused, during the master's absence. He knew
<pb id="pickard111" n="111"/>
that some of them might do wrong, and might even
deserve whipping; but he chose to be there himself
when they were punished, in order to be sure that
justice was administered; and so, whatever might be
the offence, the execution of the penalty should be
postponed till his return.</p>
          <p>On a fine May morning the carriage drove up to the
door. The trunks were strapped on behind, and a
dozen little baskets and bundles were stowed away inside.
The mistress, with her sister-in-law, Miss Mary
Gist, was handed in by Master Levi, and the nurse
followed with her little charge, the precious baby,
Mary. Uncle Frank mounted the box; he was dressed
in a new suit, and as he bowed good-bye to all his
colored friends that stood about the door, his white
tooth gleamed in the sunshine, and his black face shone
with delight.</p>
          <p>With a grand flourish of the whip he gave the signal
to the spirited horses, and away they went; while
loving eyes looked a fond adieu from the carriage
windows, and many a dark hand from the crowded
porch waved an affectionate response.</p>
          <p>Master Levi's horse was ready; and, after shaking
hands all around, and charging the servants again and
again to take good care of everything in his absence,
he sprang into the saddle, and galloped on to overtake
the carriage.</p>
          <p>Many were the warm wishes for a pleasant journey
to “young Mass'r and Missus” that followed the travellers
from that sable band; and many a fear was
breathed that “Miss' Muthis” or the sweet baby would
“git mighty tired a ridin' off so far.”</p>
          <p>Soon they dispersed to their necessary labors—all
<pb id="pickard112" n="112"/>
but Peter. He remained upon the porch alone. His
eyes were fixed on the spot where the carriage had
disappeared, and lo! they were dim with unshed tears.
Ah! it was a great pleasure he had sacrificed. Now
he should never see Lexington again. There he had
suffered much; but, after all, he loved the old place.
His boy-friends were, doubtless, scattered; yet he
would like to learn their history—he hoped they were
all happier than he.</p>
          <p>“Ha! what a fool I am!” thought he, as some sound
of busy life within the house roused him from his regretful
reverie; “here I stand, and they're gone. I'll
be married to Vina 'fore they come back, and then it'll
be too late to make a fuss about it.”</p>
          <p>He walked quietly away to his work, and all day
long, his thoughts were busier than his hands. When
his task was done, his plan was laid; and with a light
step he trod the path to Aunt Lucy's cabin, which,
since Vina went into the field, had been her home.</p>
          <p>It was easy to win her consent to immediate marriage;
for she was but a lonely girl; and her young
heart, so long unused to sympathy, bounded at the
approach of the footsteps of love.</p>
          <p>Her master readily assented to the plan proposed by
Peter; and, on the evening of the twenty-fifth of June,
all preliminary arrangements having been completed,
they were married.</p>
          <p>Old Cato Hodge, a Baptist preacher belonging to
one of the neighbors, performed the ceremony. That
over, a merry company, consisting of all Vina's fellow-servants,
and a few of Peter's best friends from his
master's plantation, enjoyed a substantial supper in the
kitchen.</p>
          <pb id="pickard113" n="113"/>
          <p>The bride was very pretty, notwithstanding her grotesque
attire, which consisted of an old white dress and
a few quaint old-fashioned ornaments, that she had
gathered from the discarded finery of her mistress.</p>
          <p>Vina was very poor. The clothes she had brought
with her from Courtland were worn out, or had been
stolen by the negroes; and a white linsey frock, which
her mistress had given her the preceding fall, was
minus the front breadth. This was the only article of
clothing she had received since she had been on the
place; and, as there was no immediate prospect of her
getting another, Peter gave her a black surtout coat of
his own with which she patched it; and though it was
now half black and half white, it was quite comfortable.</p>
          <p>She had driven four forked sticks into the ground
in Aunt Lucy's cabin, and laid poles across from, one
to the other. On these she placed four clapboards,
four and a half feet long. This was her bed; and her
only covering consisted of a piece of an old blanket,
which the kind Aunt Lucy had been able to spare to
her. Other property she had none.</p>
          <p>Peter, however, had good clothes; and when he
found that Mr. McKiernan would supply them with
no comforts, he sold many articles from his own wardrobe,
that he might provide decent clothing for his wife.</p>
          <p>Not long after her marriage, Vina again obtained
permission to visit her mother.</p>
          <p>She found her now at Mr. Peoples' place, and though
there was, perhaps, less rapture in their meeting than
at her former visit, there was more unmingled joy.
Long and earnest were the conversations they held
together, and many times the “Good Lord” was
thanked for all the kindness he had shown them.</p>
          <pb id="pickard114" n="114"/>
          <p>Aunt Sally had now a kind, considerate master,
and her husband and her oldest child were with her
there. Her former master had gone back to North
Carolina; but he had sold Quall in Courtland to a Mr.
Bynum. The poor boy had lost in the exchange of
masters; but he was still near his mother, and for that
she rendered thanks to Him who reigns above.</p>
          <p>It were needless to detail the thousand items of
advice and instruction which the young wife at this
time received from her mother. The few days allotted
to the visit passed all too soon, and the beloved
daughter was forced to say “Good-bye.” This time,
however, there was less of anguish in the parting—<hi rend="italics">all</hi>
she loved was not left behind.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
          <head>THE NEW CABIN.</head>
          <p>THERE was an anxious gathering of dark faces just
after sunset. Earnest eyes were peering through the
trees in the direction of the great road, and long fingers
shook threatfully at each little sable urchin, that could
not stand still, and listen for the carriage wheels. The
cook bustled about—now in the kitchen watching her
biscuits lest they should bake too brown; now in the
house, to be sure that nothing was wanting on the neat
supper table, and then her steaming figure came puffing
through the crowd before the door, that she might be
the first to welcome “Missus.”</p>
          <p>There! the faint rumble of wheels is heard approaching.
A joyous shout rises from the excited throng;
and a score of tiny feet fly in the direction of the sound.
There is a merry strife between the proprietors of all
these little feet for the high privilege of opening the
gate for “Missus,” but it lasts not long. The carriage
comes in sight, and all the little eager hands are laid
at once upon the gate, which flies wide open at their
touch.</p>
          <p>Here they come! Old Frank's smile is brighter,
even in the twilight, than when last it beamed upon
<pb id="pickard116" n="116"/>
us in the full morning sunshine, and as he wheels
proudly up before the door, his old heart warms at the
kindly smiles that beam upon him.</p>
          <p>How quickly is the carriage door flung open, and
the steps let down! and how lightly the beautiful mistress
is set down in the midst of her delighted servants,
every one of whom pushes forward to offer a warm
welcome home. The fair hand she presents is reverently
shaken or tenderly kissed, and “How d'y'
Missus?” “Oh! you's pertier 'an ever!” “How glad
I is you's come home once mo'!” greet her on every
side, as she passes into the house.</p>
          <p>Nurse tenderly lifts the little Mary from the carriage.
She is fast asleep, and as she lays her in her late
deserted cradle, the dark faces steal along, one by one,
to get a peep at her sweet baby-face.</p>
          <p>“Bless my life! if dar aint Mass'r! Hi! we all's so
glad see Missus, we done forget Mass'r gwine come too!”
The hearty welcomes are repeated, the extended hand
is duly shaken, and by the time Missus, with the aid
of a dozen eager hands can be prepared to sit down at
the table, supper is brought in.</p>
          <p>“Well Peter, so you've stolen a march on us since
we've been gone—been getting married, hey?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Sir, I's been gettin' married.”</p>
          <p>“Ha! ha! you thought the folks at Lexington had
all forgotten you. Well, since you have been so smart,
I must try and buy your wife for you. You'll not be
worth much if you have to be running off every week
to see your family. Besides, Mr. McKiernan intends
to move to Bainbridge about Christmas, and then you'll
have a long road to travel.</p>
          <p>But Vina's master had no intention of selling her.
<pb id="pickard117" n="117"/>
She was one of the best servants he had. He would,
however, be glad to buy her husband—very glad.</p>
          <p>That was out of the question. Neither Mr. Gist nor
his wife would consent to sell him, and if they had
been willing to part with him, Peter himself would
have remonstrated. He knew too well the difference
between the two masters to wish for an exchange.</p>
          <p>Thus matters stood till Christmas. Peter went frequently
to see his wife, as it was so near, and neither
his master nor his mistress endeavored to dissuade him
from doing so. They had tested their influence with
Levin, and they had no desire to repeat the strife.</p>
          <p>The brick house that had been built at Bainbridge
was now occupied by Mr. McKiernan. He had bought
a large plantation there,—much of it new land, and to
clear it, and fit it for corn and cotton, required the utmost
diligence.</p>
          <p>There was no time to build cabins, though there were
not half enough for the numerous families of slaves
that he carried with him. Every family, therefore,
that wished a house to themselves, were obliged to
spend their Sundays in building it.</p>
          <p>Peter immediately commenced preparations for building
a cabin for his wife. Every Saturday he walked
to Bainbridge—a distance of seven miles; and early
on Sunday morning, he was at his work. All the holy
day he toiled, and often when the moon shone, his
work ceased not till late at night. Then by the first
peep of Monday's dawn, he was up and away, to commence
his weekly labors for his master.</p>
          <p>Peter was obliged to cut the timber for his house,
himself, and then to haul it across the creek. When
that was all prepared, he hired men to help him
<pb id="pickard118" n="118"/>
raise it; and though he did his best, it was April when
he had the little building finished.</p>
          <p>The roof was made of boards, and the chimney of
sticks and clay. Puncheons (slabs) formed the floor,
and the ground itself made an excellent hearth. Peter
was more extravagant than many architects of kindred
edifices, in that he had a floor at all. The bare earth
is generally deemed sufficient, and it becomes at length
by constant treading, almost as hard as brick.</p>
          <p>The house completed, it was empty. Peter had
worked nights and holidays, and had earned all he
could, but, alas! that was very little; and now he was
forced to sell more of his clothes to buy the most necessary
articles of furniture. Two or three cooking
utensils, two chairs, and a trunk, he procured at first.
Then he cut a walnut tree, and “hauled” it to the mill.
for a bedstead, and when that was done, a straw bed
was prepared and laid upon it.</p>
          <p>Every Sunday morning at Mr. McKiernan's, the
weekly allowance was weighed out. This was generally
practised by the Kentucky planters. Their servants
all ate together, and usually a plentiful supply
was cooked for them. But here, a peck of unsifted
meal, and three and a half pounds of bacon, was the
weekly allowance. The piece might be more than half
bone, yet no additional weight was allowed on that
account. No vegetables were provided for them, if
they wished any they might raise them for themselves;
and then, if they had any desire for decent or comfortable
clothes, or any little articles of furniture, they could
<hi rend="italics">sell</hi> the few vegetables which their patches produced,
in order to procure them.</p>
          <p>Mr. Gist had bought a shoemaker, not long before,
<pb id="pickard119" n="119"/>
and he had cheerfully imparted instruction in his art to his
friend Peter. The slight skill he acquired in this branch of
industry was now of great use to him, as he was able to
make his own shoes, and those of his wife; thus saving
many a dollar that must otherwise have been expended.
He also earned many comforts for his cabin by making
shoes at night for his fellow slaves.</p>
          <p>After a while, <hi rend="italics">as the wealth of the young couple
increased</hi>, they bought a cupboard, and afterwards a
chest. This latter article was very necessary, that Vina
might lock up her week's provisions, and any little
comforts which Peter brought her; as, if they were
exposed, some of the half-clad hungry slaves were sure to
steal them.</p>
          <p>A flour barrel, too, the provident young husband
bought, thinking it would be useful in their humble
housekeeping; but before he had a chance to take it
home, Mr. Gist's overseer took the liberty to appropriate
it to his own use.</p>
          <p>“That's my bar'l, sir,” said Peter, as he saw him
removing it, “and I want to use it myself.”</p>
          <p>“D—n you! hush your mouth, you nigger! I'll let you
know you're not to forbid me to use a bar'l when I want
it.”</p>
          <p>“But it's mine,” persisted Peter; “I bought it, and I's
gwine carry it to my wife.”</p>
          <p>The overseer was enraged; but he dared take no
vengeance except the weak one of showering upon the
offender his most terrible curses. When he had exhausted
his stock of these, he was forced to wait till the master
returned from town.</p>
          <p>He then complained to Mr. Gist that one of his
<pb id="pickard120" n="120"/>
niggers had been impudent to him, and swore he
would have revenge. “And if” added he, “I don't
whip him now, I'll give him something that will hurt
him a heap worse.”</p>
          <p>The master hesitated, but finally, judging from the
fellow's temper, that such a course would be safest for
his slave, he gave, him permission to whip him very
slightly. Accordingly, Peter was taken to the stable,
where twenty-five lashes were inflicted on his naked
back.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
          <head>THE YOUNG MOTHER.</head>
          <p>ON the twelfth of September, 1826, the wailing of a
tiny voice was heard in Vina's cabin. A new fount
of love gushed up in her mother-heart, to bless the
little trembler; and her frame thrilled with a delicious
joy, as she proudly placed in her husband's arms his
first-born boy.</p>
          <p>Oh! how happily to his mother passed the first four
weeks of the existence of this little one. Quietly Vina
sat in her cabin; and, as she gazed upon the innocent
face of her child, and saw his little eyes learning to seek
hers in loving trustfulness, her cup was not <hi rend="italics">all</hi> bitter.
She knew her babe was born to slavery—and sorrow;
but oh! so dearly did she love it! And, perhaps,
after all, it might fall into kind hands, and be far happier
than its parents.</p>
          <p>Now, with her joy, her care was doubled. As soon
as she was able to sit up, she toiled to the extent of
her strength to put everything in order in her cabin,
before <hi rend="italics">her month</hi> was up.</p>
          <p>Peter had managed to provide materials for a comfortable
wardrobe for the little stranger; and she now
took great pleasure in making up the tiny garments.
They were certainly not very fine, nor traced with elegant
<pb id="pickard122" n="122"/>
embroidery; but when she had them all finished,
and laid, neatly folded, in the trunk, she could not
help lifting the lid now and then, to see how nice they
looked.</p>
          <p>Then she washed and mended all her own and
Peter's clothes; for she knew she should have but
little time after she went to the field again.</p>
          <p>When she did go out, poor little Peter (for the baby
bore his father's name), was left all alone upon her
bed. Four times in the day, while yet he was very
young, she was permitted to go in and minister to his
little wants. But she had then only a few minutes
to stay; and, though in her heart she longed to lull
him to sleep upon her breast, and though he cried so
hard when she laid him down, yet she must go.</p>
          <p>How tenderly, when she was employed as nurse in
Courtland, had she cared for the little ones entrusted
to her care! How anxiously had she watched every
indication of uneasiness, lest they should be sick!
And when the moan of pain fell on her ear, how well
she knew the simple remedies for all their little ailments!
Now that her own babe needed her constant
care, she could not be spared. <hi rend="italics">The cotton must be picked.</hi></p>
          <p>How her heart ached when she heard him crying, as
she often did, when she was at work in the field near
the quarter. And if the overseer chanced to be at a
distance, so that she thought he would not observe her,
how suddenly she darted between the trees that sheltered
the cabins, and entered the house! How she
pressed her baby to her breast, while her tears fell on
his little face! And when she dared not stay a minute
longer, how gently she laid him down again, and imprinted
one fond kiss upon his cheek.</p>
          <pb id="pickard123" n="123"/>
          <p>When she came in at night, she built a bright fire
on the clay hearth, and cooked her supper. Then she
brought water from the spring and having undressed
her boy, she washed him thoroughly. How he enjoyed
the nice cool bath! and how he kicked and laughed in
token of his gratitude! But his mother had no time to
play with him, for it grew late. So when she had arrayed
him in clean clothes, she tied him in a chair, and
hastened to her work. There he sat and watched her
till his eyelids drooped, and he sank quietly to sleep,
while she washed all the garments he had worn that
day, and hung them up to dry. Then, after making
her cabin as neat as possible, and preparing her food
for the next day, she throw off her clothes, and with
her baby on her bosom, laid her down to rest.</p>
          <p>Many times when she had some extra work to do,
her own and her husband's washing, for instance, or
an old coat to mend, the morning of another day
dawned in the east before her task was done. But the
overseer's horn blew not a minute the later, because
she had not slept. With aching eyes, and weary limbs,
she went forth to the field; and through all the long
day, her feet lagged not, though sometimes “'pears
like,” to use her own expression, she could not keep
awake. “But I wouldn't see my child go dirty and
raggety,” added she, “if I didn't never git a wink o'
sleep.”</p>
          <p>How welcome to poor Vina was the approach of the
Sabbath day! How her eyes brightened, and her
heart grew light, as its morning beams filled her little
cabin, and revealed her husband playing with his boy.</p>
          <p>Sometimes they dressed in their best clothes, and,
taking little Peter in their arms, walked to meeting on
<pb id="pickard124" n="124"/>
that day; But oftener they were busy through all its
precious hours, working in the patch, or performing
morningsome necessary labor about the house.</p>
          <p>A large field was divided into as many little patches
as there were field hands on the plantation; and every
slave could here work nights and Sundays to cultivate
his crop. Some raised cotton, others corn; and many
planted their patches entirely to water-melons. If the
overseer chanced to be “far'ard” with his work, and
there was not much mass among the corn and cotton,
they could sometimes have a half holiday on Saturday
to work for themselves. But chiefly they depended
on their Sundays. Early in the morning they were
out with mules and ploughs, and till late at night they
toiled to raise their little crops. When the moon
shone brightly, if they were getting “in the grass,”
they often remained at work all night.</p>
          <p>The corn and cotton that they “<hi rend="italics">made,</hi>” they were
obliged to sell to their master—<hi rend="italics">at his price</hi>, which was
seldom more than half the market value. But the
water-melons they were allowed to carry to town.
This was the most profitable crop they raised, if they
could get the fruit into market at the right time; but,
as Saturday was the only day on which they could go,
and as all that had fruit to sell could not have wagons
at the same time, they frequently lost portions of their
crops.</p>
          <p>They also raised chickens; and for these there was
always a ready market in the neighborhood. Mrs.
McKiernan, herself, frequently bought them of her
servants, and <hi rend="italics">she</hi> never failed to pay them <hi rend="italics">a fair price</hi>.</p>
          <p>When little Peter was about a year old, his mother
had a severe illness. The disease was inflammation of
<pb id="pickard125" n="125"/>
the brain, and the cause thereof we give in her own
words.</p>
          <p>“I never got a heap o' whippin' no how, but when
Bill Simms was oversee' he give me one mons's hard
beatin', bekase I wouldn't s'mit to him 'bout everything he wanted.</p>
          <p>“He pestered me a heap, but I told him I wouldn't
never do no such a thing; I told him I'd got a
husban' o' my own; and I was n't gwine have nothin'
to do with nobody else. He tried to starve me to it—
many a Sunday, when he weighed out the 'lowance, he
never give me half my sheer, and I couldn't git no
more for a week; but I did n't mind that.</p>
          <p>“At last he told me if I did n't 'bey him, he'd whip
me nigh 'bout to death. I told him he might kill me,
but I wouldn't never do it, no how. So when I's in
the field one day, he tuck and whipped me—I didn't
call it whippin'—I called it beatin'. He tied my
hands with his hand'chief, and pulled my coat off o'
the waist; and then he beat me till I couldn't hardly
stand. He struck me over the head mos'ly, and tried
to knock me down with the butt end o' his bull-whip.
My head was cut in a heap o' places, whar the scars is
on it yit.</p>
          <p>“I reckon he wouldn't 'a' give me so much, but I
tried to fight him at first, and he had to call two o' the
men to help him tie me. By that time he got so mad
that he jist went 'cordin' to his own mercy. I knowed
I's in his power, but I's determined to die in the cause.</p>
          <p>“The other people was all in sight, and he made out
like he's beatin' me 'bout my work; but he told me
it's all bekase I would'nt 'bey him.</p>
          <p>“When he done beatin' he curse me powerful, and
<pb id="pickard126" n="126"/>
say, if I ever tole this yer to mass'r, or to any person
else so it would get to him, he'd give me a heap more;
and if that didn't do, he'd shoot me.</p>
          <p>“I was determined he shouldn't never conquer me,
no how; but he was that mean, I was feared he mought
kill me sly; so I never said nothin' 'bout it, to nobody
but Peter. He came home a Sunday, and when he's
sittin' by me, he sort o' put his arm 'round me. ‘Oh!’
says I, ‘don't put yer arm thar, you hurt my back!’</p>
          <p>“ ‘What's the matter o' yer back?’ says he.</p>
          <p>“ ‘'Oh, it's mighty sore whar ole Bill Simms done
beat me,’ says I, ‘but don't you tell nobody, for if he
finds out I done tol' the tale, he'll kill me, sure.’</p>
          <p>“Peter felt mighty bad when I told him what I got
the beatin' for—'peared like, he could 'a' gone right
out and killed ole Bill Simms on the spot. He never
liked him, no how—they had a fallin' out, afore, when
he was overseein' for Mars Levi Gist.</p>
          <p>“But 'twasn't no use gittin' mad 'bout it, nor tellin'
mass'r nuther; bekase he allers say if any person come
to him with complaints 'bout the oversee's, he'd give
em worse, hisself.</p>
          <p>“The next Sunday, Simms come up afore my house
and spoke to Peter, whar was a standin' in the door.</p>
          <p>“Peter answered him mighty low, and that made
him mad, bekase he 'lowed I done told him how I been
'bused. ‘Seems to me,’ says he, ‘you're gettin' mighty
grand. You're too great a gentleman to speak to a
white person with respect. Never mind, I'll do you a
kindness some o' these days. I owe you something
this long time.’</p>
          <p>“ ‘Well,’ says Peter, ‘that debt never will be paid
till the judgment day.’</p>
          <pb id="pickard127" n="127"/>
          <p>“I tremble every minute, for I 'lowed I should have
to take more next day; but I reckon he thought how 't
wasn't no use, for he never said nuthin' to me 'bout it
no more.</p>
          <p>“I had a heap o' misery in my head all the time for
two weeks arter I tuck that beatin', and then I got
right sick, and they said I's out o' my senses for a
week. They sent for the doctor, but I didn't know
nuthin' 'bout it, and he said I'd tuck some mighty hard
blows on the head. He left medicine, and missus, she
stay by me all the time. She sent for Peter to come—
she reckoned I'd know him—but 'twasn't no use.
They all 'lowed I's gwine to die; and then Peter, he
told 'em all 'bout what done make me sick.</p>
          <p>“Mass'r was mighty mad. ‘Why the devil didn't
she tell me this afore?’ says he.</p>
          <p>“ ‘Bekase,’ says Peter, ‘she knowed your rule, that
you don't keer how hard an oversee' beat, your servants,
if they comes to you, they shall git worse.’</p>
          <p>“Mass'r felt mighty bad then, but he 'lowed I might
knowed he'd protect me in that.</p>
          <p>“I reckon I shouldn't never got well, if they all
hadn't tuck such good care o' me. When I got so I
could talk, mass'r ax me why I never told him what a
beatin' old Simms done give me.</p>
          <p>“ ‘What I come to you for,' says I, 'you allers told
us never to do that, without we wanted more. If I'd
'lowed 'twould done any good I'd 'a' come to you, sir,
mons's quick.’</p>
          <p>“Soon as I's able to walk from the bed to the fire,
mass'r come in to see me, and brought old Simms with
him. Then he axed me 'bout that beatin' right afore
him, and I told it to his face. 'Twas so true, he
<pb id="pickard128" n="128"/>
couldn't deny it. Mass'r cursed him mightily, and
told him he should pay my doctor's bill, and pay for
everyday whar I was sick. I never knowed 'bout the
payin' whether he done it or not, but mass'r drove him
off the place, and he never come on it agin.</p>
          <p>“I see him twice after that. The first time we's all
gwine to meetin'. I see him comin', and says I, ‘Thar
comes the devil; I ain't gwine to look at him.’ So
I pulled my bonnet down over my face and when he
come 'long, and say how d'y' to the rest, I never look
up.</p>
          <p>“The next time I met old Simms, look like he's the
picter o' Death. He been mighty sick, and jist got
able to ride out.</p>
          <p>“That thar was the last o' his ridin'. He took a
'lapse arter that, and then he died in a mighty short
time.</p>
          <p>“When I heard he's dead, I's so glad! My heart
couldn't help from shoutin', though it oughten't.”</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
          <head>DEATH OF A KIND MASTER.</head>
          <p>THE sunshine of prosperity beamed steadily upon
the peaceful home of Mr. and Mrs. Gist. Gradually
their worldly substance increased; and the dearer
treasures of their hearts were multiplied.</p>
          <p>The Spring of 1830, when she had waked the delicate
flowers of the forest, came noiselessly on, and with
careful hand, unfolded the rosebuds that climbed on
the porch.</p>
          <p>Near the half-open door sat the young husband and
his still beautiful wife. Not a line of care or sorrow
had stolen across their foreheads; not a shade of coldness
or distrust had fallen on their hearts. Their
children sported before them—two lovely girls and a
brave boy, the youngest, and the pet of all.</p>
          <p>Ah! came no whispering voice to bid them prize
these golden moments? Entered no dread of change
into all the plans they formed together? None! The
sweet Spring smiled on them from without—the
parching Summer drought she never heralds.</p>
          <p>They were planning a visit to Kentucky. It was
five years since they had enjoyed the hospitalities of
that endeared home of other days; and the beloved
parent, from whom they had been so long severed,
<pb id="pickard130" n="130"/>
were growing old. Yes; they would go to Lexington.</p>
          <p>On a bright May morning a few weeks after, the
family carriage rolled away from the door, with its
precious burden of gentle trusting hearts. Tears
gathered in dark eyes that gazed fondly after the <sic corr="travellers">travvellers</sic>;
and fond adieus to loving favorites were tossed
back by tiny hands.</p>
          <p>“'Pears like,” sobbed Aunt Ceely, “somethin's
gwine happen. I's had mighty bad dreams dese las'
nights.”</p>
          <p>“Oh! you's allers a dreamin'; reckon yer dreams
aint much 'count,” replied a cheerful girl at her side.</p>
          <p>“I reckon nuthin' aint gwine hurt dem, no how;
dey's been to Kaintucky 'fore dis,” said another, who,
though sad herself, would fain dispel Aunt Ceely's
gloom.</p>
          <p>The old woman turned towards the kitchen, and her
croaking was soon forgotten. But when at night she
smoked her pipe before her kitchen door, the shadow
of impending ill darkened her heart.</p>
          <p>Summer came with its heat, and wearying toil, and
September passed away, and still the house was closed.
Now and then, for a few hours the windows were
thrown open, that the fresh air of morning might wander
through the deserted rooms. But it would not
tarry long; for it missed the merry children, to whose
radiant eyes and blooming cheeks it had been wont to
lend a deeper glow. So, after kissing lovingly each
little couch, and chair, and scattered toy, the soft air
flew away, to dally with the summer leaves that
danced at its approach.</p>
          <p>Early in October, new life seemed to have awakened
<pb id="pickard131" n="131"/>
on the plantation. The laborers stepped more briskly
out at morning, and the house servants went bustling
through the lonely rooms, “clarin' up, and putting
things to rights for Missus.”</p>
          <p>There were no gloomy faces now—no dark foreboding
of approaching woe; Aunt Ceely herself forgot
her dreams, she was so busy planning a nice supper,
such as she knew suited “Mars Levi when he come
home hongry.”</p>
          <p>The last day of September was the time appointed
for the family to leave Lexington, and though the
summer had passed most pleasantly in the society of
valued friends, yet not one of the little group wished
to remain longer.</p>
          <p>On the day previous to their intended departure, a
few friends sat down with them to a farewell dinner,
at the house of an uncle of Mr. Gist.</p>
          <p>The party were in fine spirits, albeit a shadow of
regret that they were so soon to part, did now and then
steal over them. Plans of future re-unions, however,
were proposed, and promises of more frequent visits
interchanged.</p>
          <p>“What is it?” whispers with bloodless lips, the
beautiful young wife, as her husband sways towards
her, and she sees that his face is ashy pale. Quickly
his friends spring to his assistance. They bear him
from the table, and support him in their arms upon,
the sofa.</p>
          <p>Ah! they saw not the Death Angel, as with white
wings he approached, and gently sealed those loving
eyes and stilled that throbbing heart. No! they saw
him not. They did not know how vain were all
their agonized endeavors to restore the warm breath to
<pb id="pickard132" n="132"/>
that manly form. “He has only fainted—give him air!”</p>
          <p>Vain hope! The warm hands grow rigid—cold. The
features become fixed. Can it be he is dead?</p>
          <p>God pity thee! fond wife—and grant thee tears—that thy
young heart break not.</p>
          <p>In the parlor, at his childhood's home, was laid all that
was mortal of Levi Gist. His father and mother, with great
tears on their aged cheeks, gazed tenderly upon the face of
their first-born son; and his little children stole up on tiptoe
to look at dear papa; and wondered that he lay so still, when
only yesterday, he told them they should start for home to-day.
Dear little ones! too soon shall ye learn the full
meaning of that cold word—fatherless!</p>
          <p>The funeral was over. Fond eyes had gazed for the last
time on those clear features, and to the earth had been
consigned the sacred dust. Words of condolence had been
duly uttered—Oh! how they rent <hi rend="italics">her</hi> heart!—and curious
eyes had scrutinized the widow's face and manner, to
ascertain how keenly she felt the stroke. All these were
satisfied. They saw her glazed eye, and pallid cheek; and
even their morbid jealousy for grief could exact no more.</p>
          <p>The desolate woman returned, with her children to her
thenceforth darkened home.</p>
          <p>No smiles greeted her coming now; but great hot tears
glistened on the dark cheeks of the faithful band that came
forth to meet her.</p>
          <p>Well might they weep that their only protector had fallen!
Where, in all the country round, could be found another
such master? His servants had been, in some sense, his
children; subject, it is true to his
<pb id="pickard133" n="133"/>
passions and caprices—and who is free from these? Still he
had ever protected them from the violence of overseers and
other ruffians, and their supply of wholesome food and
comfortable clothes had not been scant.</p>
          <p>Equally kind, and even more indulgent, had been their
mistress, and she was spared to them. But now the
government would, partially, at least, fall into other hands;
there was no will, and the estate must be settled according
to law.</p>
          <p>Deeply, notwithstanding her own grief, did the kind
mistress sympathize with her people in their peculiar sorrow;
and earnestly did she resolve to do her utmost to alleviate
the hardships of their lot.</p>
          <p>Mr. John Gist, a brother of the deceased, proceeded to
administer upon the estate, while Mrs. Gist remained on the
place, and preserved, as far as possible, the accustomed
order of affairs.</p>
          <p>She was now a stately woman, of somewhat haughty
presence, and with an eye whose lightning few would dare
to brave. Usually, her voice was gentle, and her manners mild;
but when the helpless were outraged, she summoned all her
powers to awe and to command—for their relief. One
instance will suffice to show her spirit.</p>
          <p>It was Sunday evening, and Peter and Allison, who
had been to visit some of their friends on a neighboring
plantation, were returning home, when, to make their
road shorter, they crossed a field belonging to Col. John
D—.</p>
          <p>Now, the gallant Colonel had made a law that no negro
belonging to his neighbor, should cross his field on Sunday;
and his overseer, named S—, by chance
<pb id="pickard134" n="134"/>
spying those trespassers, ran after them cowhide in
hand.</p>
          <p>They heard him on their track, and made all speed
for home. Bounding over the door-yard fence, they
imagined themselves safe; but in an instant, their
pursuer leaped over after them, and even followed
them to the kitchen, where they hastened to take
refuge.</p>
          <p>Here the slaves determined to do battle, and one of
them had seized the rolling-pin, and the other a large
knife, when their mistress, hearing the tumult, came
to the door.</p>
          <p>The overseer quailed beneath her haughty eye.
“What is your business here, sir,” said she, in a voice
steady and brave.</p>
          <p>He explained his errand; with much trepidation
however, for her great eyes were fixed upon him, and
her majestic form seemed to grow taller every instant.</p>
          <p>“Well, sir,” said she, when he ceased speaking,
“leave these premises immediately, and let this be the
last time your foot approaches my house on such an
errand. My boys are not subject to your authority;
if they do wrong, it is not your business to punish
them.”</p>
          <p>The overseer departed in silence, seeming much
smaller in his own eyes than he had appeared an hour
before.</p>

          <head>LEVIN'S DEATH.</head>
          <p>JUST a year after the death of his master, Levin's
health, which had been poor for several years, began
rapidly to decline; and it was soon plain to all who
saw him that his work was done.</p>
          <p>His sufferings soon became intense, but he endured
them with great patience. Levin was a Christian.
His intellect, it is true, had possessed few means of development,
but he had heard of the Lamb that was
slain. Upon that bleeding sacrifice his hopes had long
been fixed; and though in much ignorance and weakness,
yet earnestly had he sought to follow his Redeemer.
Now as the death-hour approached, he heard
a voice, saying, “My peace I give unto you, not as
the world giveth, give I unto you;” and, calmly resigning
himself into His arms who is a Saviour of the
weakest and the lowliest, he waited quietly the coming
of the last Messenger.</p>
          <p>Poor Fanny was permitted to spend the last days by
his side. This was a great comfort to both, for they
had suffered much for each other, and it was very hard
to part so soon. But Levin talked so sweetly of the
green fields and still waters of that better land, that
<pb id="pickard136" n="136"/>
she could not wish to prolong his painful sojourn
here.</p>
          <p>It was the twenty-eighth of December. Peter had
gone to Bainbridge, to make his usual Christmas visit
to his wife and little ones, and by the bed-side of her
dying husband sat the devoted Fanny. Yet, though
her eye watched every sign of change, she knew not
that he was departing.</p>
          <p>Sadly she gazed upon his placid face. Ah! did he
not look happy? Why should she weep?—and yet
the tears<hi rend="italics">would</hi> flow.</p>
          <p>“Call Peter, Fanny,” said he, suddenly waking from
a gentle sleep.</p>
          <p>“Peter's gone to Bainbridge.”</p>
          <p>A shade of disappointment passed over his face—
for a few moments he remained silent. Then suddenly,
with all his strength he cried, “Peter! Peter!
O, Peter!”</p>
          <p>But the loved brother answered not. Ah! little
thought he, as he sat fondling his children, and holding
pleasant converse with their mother, that poor
Levin's heart, even at that hour, was breaking.</p>
          <p>There was but a slight struggle,—a faint gasp,—and
the freed spirit of the lowly slave was carried by the
angels into Abraham's bosom.</p>
          <p>They placed the lifeless form in a rude coffin, and
bore it to its lowly grave. No stone marks his resting
place; no fragrant flowers adorn the sod that covers
his silent house. Yet he sleeps sweetly there. The
loud horn of the overseer reaches not his ear at dawn;
the harsh tone of command and the bitter blasphemous
curse break not his peaceful slumbers.</p>
          <p>The death of this clear brother cast a heavy gloom
<pb id="pickard137" n="137"/>
upon Peter's spirits. He felt that he was now alone.
The memories of their early childhood, of their
mother's love, and of the sad, sad day when they were
stolen from their home, there was now none to share.
And the fond hope, which through all their years of
bondage had lived far down in some hidden recess of
his heart—even that one hope went out—and all was
dark.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
          <head>THE JAUNT TO FLORIDA.</head>
          <p>PATIENTLY, month after month, Aunt Sally pursued
her labors on the plantation of Mr. Peoples. She
had a kind master, and her boys were near her, as was
also Uncle Moses, the husband of her latter years.
Of poor Silas, to whom her heart's young affections
had been given, she never heard. He might be dead,
and—oh! what torture in the thought!—he might be
enduring sufferings compared with which, even death
itself were naught. She could only pray for his weal;
and trust, as she ever found it sweet to do, to that compassionate
father, who loves the prayers of the humble,
while “the proud he knoweth afar off.”</p>
          <p>But it was concerning her daughter that Aunt
Sally's spirit was most deeply troubled. She was so
young to be taken away—and alone among strangers
too—how often would she need her mother's sympathy
and counsel!</p>
          <p>“Well,” said she to Uncle Moses, at the close of one
of their frequent conversations on the subject. “I's
mighty glad de pore chile done got married, 'Pears
like she wont be so lonesome now. I'd like to see her
ole man. But her missus—she's a screamer. Laws!
Vine say de little gal whar waits in de house gits her
back cut up powerful, and she's a sickly little thing.
Hi! wont dem kind o' ladies cotch it mightily when
<pb id="pickard139" n="139"/>
de bad man gits 'em? Reckon he wont think dey's
so mons's nice, kase dey's white. De Lord years all
de screams o' his chilluns, and he aint gwine put harps
o' gold in dem dare hands, whar allers a playin wid de
cowhide yer.”</p>
          <p>There were at this time two sets of slaves on Mr.
Peoples' place; his own, and those belonging to the
estate of a deceased brother, with whom he had been
in partnership. Many of these were united by family
ties, and all were strongly attached to each other, as
they had lived together for many years.</p>
          <p>Suddenly, late in the autumn of 1827, the gloomy
tidings came among them that they were to be separated.
Their master, having heard tempting accounts
of the beauty and fertility of Florida's fair plains, had
determined to remove there with his working hands:
while those belonging to his brother's estate, as well as
the children and any that were unfit for labor, should
remain on the home place, in the guardianship of an
overseer.</p>
          <p>Aunt Sally was overwhelmed with sorrow. She
was more fortunate than many of her companions, for
her husband and her oldest son were to go with her;
but poor Quall must stay behind, and Vina—she had
not seen her for two years. She longed to make her a
farewell visit, but such was now the haste to secure
the crop, and to complete the needful preparations for
the journey, that she could not go even to “tell” her
darling child “good-bye.”</p>
          <p>The master strove to comfort them by the promise
that they should some day return; or, if he liked the
country so well as to wish to remain in Florida, then
their friends should come to them. But the dim hope
<pb id="pickard140" n="140"/>
in the distant future could not dispel the present gloom;
and with bitter lamentations fond mothers pressed their
weeping children to their aching breasts, and loving
husbands turned back for one more look on those dear
faces which they never more might see.</p>
          <p>They have gone! Their friends stand mournfully
watching the sad procession till it passes out of sight
and their stricken hearts breathe earnest prayers for
the safe keeping of their dearest treasures.</p>
          <p>Vina did not hear of Mr. Peoples' intended removal
till his family had already arrived in Florida; and her
grief was then extreme. To lose her mother thus,
without receiving so much as a parting message, was
harder far than all her previous trials. Not even the
laughing prattle of her little Peter could dispel this
heavy sorrow; not even her husband's love could
soothe her aching heart.</p>
          <p>But a kind Providence was better to them than their
fears. Mr. Peoples did not like Florida; and when he
had “made one crop,” he returned with all his slaves
in glad procession, to his former home.</p>
          <p>Ah! earth is not all gloomy, for there be sometimes
glad reunions, when the partings have been dismal—
hopeless. There be transient gleams of joy, though
misery hath hung her heavy clouds over all the sky.
There is an Infinite Father who looketh down in love
on the weakest of his children; and though he suffer
them to drink a bitter cup, he often mingles therewith
rare drops of sweetness.</p>
          <p>The summer following her return from Florida, Aunt
Sally paid a visit to her daughter.</p>
          <p>What changes have been wrought during the four
years that had passed since she had seen her child.
<pb id="pickard141" n="141"/>
Vina had grown quite tall, and her face, instead of the
timidity and sadness that then marked its expression,
now wore a careful <hi rend="italics">mother-look.</hi> Poor child! she was
not strong and the fatiguing labor of the hot summer
days, together with the care which her two children
claimed at night, taxed her exertions to the utmost.</p>
          <p>Aunt Sally had not been long on the plantation, before
she learned the policy pursued by Mr. McKiernan
towards his slaves. Their lot was truly hard. Not an
article of furniture or clothing did they receive from
their master, except, that once a year he gave a coarse
plantation suit to such as were old enough to work.
Even this, however, was sometimes withheld, and then
those who had no means of procuring garments for
themselves, went to their daily tasks in such a ragged
filthy state, that the more respectable of the overseers
could not endure their presence. Several of these, at
different times, left the plantation, for no other reason
than that they could not stay in the field with such a
miserable gang of negroes.</p>
          <p>Little cared the master for their departure. Others
were always ready to be hired, who heeded not such
trifles, so that they could have full power over the
half-naked wretches that instinctively recoiled at their
approach.</p>
          <p>But Vina and her children, thanks to Peter's industry
and self-denial, had always decent clothing, and
their cabin boasted many convenient articles of furniture,
such as slaves seldom possess. They had also
better food than most of their companions, for to the
scant allowance of bacon and corn meal which was
doled out to Vina on Sunday mornings, Peter often
<pb id="pickard142" n="142"/>
found means to add a little coffee and sugar, or
pounds of flour.</p>
          <p>All this Aunt Sally learned during her short stay,
and for each kindness thus bestowed upon her child,
she rendered thanks to Him, whose hand she recognized
in every good.</p>
          <p>Too soon the time allotted to this precious visit
passed away; yet much of hope lingered in the sad
farewell. “Dat dar jaunt to Florida,” Aunt Sally
thought, had cured her master of his thirst for novelty;
and now, she trusted, she should never more be widely
separated from her daughter.</p>
          <p>Vina's eyes were dim, as from her cabin door, she
watched her mother's departing form. A heavy sadness
oppressed her spirits; and the kind voice of her
husband, who stood beside her, could scarce dispel her
gloom. But many little motherly duties claimed her
thoughts. Young Peter wanted his supper, while little
Levin raised his pleading voice to beg for her attendance;
and soon the pleasure of contributing to the
comfort of those she loved restored her accustomed
cheerfulness.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="chapter">
          <pb id="pickard143" n="143"/>
          <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
          <head>A SLAVE MOTHER'S “GOOD-BYE.”</head>
          <p>AUNT SALLY rode briskly homeward. She had
not felt so happy in many years as now. Her children
were all comfortably situated; even Vina, about whom
she had been so anxious, had now so kind a husband,
and such fine “peart” children, that she could no
longer repine at her lot.</p>
          <p>A few weeks glided calmly on. Summer stole
noiselessly away, and Autumn came with quiet steps,
to cool the parched earth.</p>
          <p>The cotton fields grow brown with age, and snowy
tufts burst from the ripened bolls. Tremulous they
hung—those fleecy tassels—and the cool breeze, as
with mock sympathy it sighed among the withering
leaves, lingered to whisper softly to these fair strangers,
and toss in amorous sport their dainty tresses.</p>
          <p>The crops were all gathered in. Beside the gin-house
lay great heaps of hoary cotton-seed, and the
mighty press had uttered the last creak of the season.
Under a shed hard-by, the old-fashioned, tight-laced
bales were huddled close together, and yet it was not
winter.</p>
          <p>The hands upon the place were very proud. There
was not another plantation in all the country round,
<pb id="pickard144" n="144"/>
but had great fields, where still in fleecy clusters the
precious cotton gleamed.</p>
          <p>It is night—and the people are all in their cabins.
The smiles of triumph which but a few hours since
brightened their faces have departed, and a wail of
anguish resounds through all the quarter. Mr.
Peoples has bought a sugar farm away down on the
dreadful Gulf Coast, and thither his slaves are all to be
conveyed, as soon as they can make the necessary preparations
for the journey.</p>
          <p>Look! Aunt Sally comes forth alone from her
cabin door. Tears are upon her cheeks, and her
breast is convulsed with sorrow.</p>
          <p>She walks slowly and with drooping head along a
narrow footpath leading to the woods. She kneels
upon the rustling leaves. Oh! with what humble
trustfulness she offers her agonized petitions! Has
she heard that it is written, “Like as a father pitieth
his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him?”</p>
          <p>The preparations for emigration were conducted
with the bustle and confusion usual on large plantations.
There were full three hundred slaves; and
their master intended to carry along provisions sufficient
for one year's consumption, as well as corn for
the horses, mules and cattle. Then all the utensils
of the farm were collected and repaired; and each
family had to arrange its own little store of clothes
and furniture.</p>
          <p>During the day, the constant occupation of the
slaves prevented the contemplation of their gloomy
prospects. At night, however, they had time to think;
and then the torrent of their grief broke forth afresh.
In every cabin might be heard the voice of weeping;
<pb id="pickard145" n="145"/>
and the rude pallets, on which reposed their weary
limbs, were wet with bitter tears.</p>
          <p>When all was ready, and the cattle and stores had
been conveyed to the river's bank, then came the final
leave-taking. Husbands and wives, brothers and
sisters, parents and children, who belonged on neighboring
plantations, came with sobs and tears to say
“farewell” to those whose hearts were breaking.</p>
          <p>Aunt Sally came hurriedly, with a small bundle in
her hand, from her empty cabin. Hastily she walked
along the road to Courtland, and paused not until she
reached the residence of Mr. B—, where dwelt her
youngest child.</p>
          <p>Poor Quall! henceforth he would be motherless! He
saw her form approaching, and ran to meet her. Oh!
the tender agony of that last long embrace.</p>
          <p>He was her darling boy, how could she leave him?
He clung around her neck. She felt his warm breath
on her check. O Saviour! pity them! It is their last
fond meeting—their last heart-crushed “good bye.”</p>
          <p>With desperate strength she tore herself from his
arms; and with one prayer to Heaven to bless and
keep her boy, she thrust the little bundle into his
powerless hand, and hastened on to join her gloomy
comrades.</p>
          <p>The rendezvous was Bainbridge. To this point some
came on foot, and others on the boats over the shoals.
Here they were obliged to wait till all the boats arrived;
and now a faint hope sprang up in Aunt Sally's
heart that she might yet see her daughter. She determined
at least to make one effort.</p>
          <p>A gentleman on horseback was slowly riding by.
It was Andrew Gist. Hastily she approached him.
<pb id="pickard146" n="146"/>
He pitied her evident distress, and listened kindly to
the recital of her sorrows.</p>
          <p>“So your daughter is at McKiernan's. What is her
name?”</p>
          <p>“Her name Vina, Sir.”</p>
          <p>“Vina? why that is Peter's wife.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Sir, her man name Peter. He belongs to Mars
Levi Gist.”</p>
          <p>“Well, I'll find her myself, and send her down to
see you. Come, cheer up, Auntie, you'll have good
times yet.”</p>
          <p>The field where Mr. McKiernan's people were at
work was three miles from the landing, but the Kentuckian's
fine horse soon bore him there.</p>
          <p>“Which of you all has a mother at Peoples'?” said
he, as he rode up to a group of women.</p>
          <p>“It's Vina's mother whar lives dar, Sir:—yon's
Vina,” replied a young girl, pointing as she spoke, to
the object of his search. She was working alone, at a
short distance from her companions, and did not look
up till she was addressed.</p>
          <p>“Howd'y' Vina, does your mother belong to Peoples?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Sir.”</p>
          <p>“Well, if you go down to the landing, you'll see the
last of her, I reckon, for she's going down the river.
Peoples is moving down to the coast.”</p>
          <p>He rode away, and Vina gazed after him in speechless
terror. Her mother—the coast—could it be? One
moment she started towards the overseer to ask permission
to go to the river—the next her courage failed
her, and she felt sure he would not let her go. She
<pb id="pickard147" n="147"/>
tried to work, but her limbs seemed palsied, and her
eyes were full of blinding tears.</p>
          <p>After nearly an hour had passed, she summoned all
her strength, and left the field. With fearful steps she
walked to the house, and fortunately her master and
mistress were both at home. She told them what Mr.
Gist had said, and touched with pity, they bade her go
immediately to the landing and stay with her mother
as long as the boats remained.</p>
          <p>A strange picture met her eye as she approached the
river. Along the bank in the dim twilight, gleamed
the blaze of numerous fires, and around these were
gathered groups of unhappy slaves. Some were cooking
their simple suppers, and others close huddled
together, warmed their benumbed limbs, while they
bewailed, in low sad tones, their gloomy destiny. Mothers
hovered tenderly over the dear little ones that
never more might hear their fathers' voices, and here
and there, like a majestic tree by lightning blasted,
stood a lone father, who had left all—wife, children,
hope, behind.</p>
          <p>Vina, paused, and listened, but in the sad murmur
that met her ear she heard not her mother's voice. She
passed on. Four large flat boats were tied to the bank,
and one of these she timidly entered.</p>
          <p>A great fire was glowing at the further end of the
boat, and dark figures were moving slowly about in
the uncertain light. She heard no mirthful voices, no
gay laugh; but heavy sighs and mournful wailings
filled her ears.</p>
          <p>On a low stool near the fire sat a female figure. Her
bowed head rested on both her hands, and her body
swayed to and fro, in unison with the melancholy
<pb id="pickard148" n="148"/>
measure of her thoughts. Vina came very near. She
paused. Aunt Sally raised her head, and with a cry,
half joy—half anguish, she clasped her daughter to
her breast.</p>
          <p>“O my chile! I's studyin' 'bout you, whether I's
ever gwine see you agin or not,” and she sobbed aloud.
“Oh! how can I go and leave you, honey? I shan't
never come back no more! 'Way down on de sugar
farm I shall die, and der wont be no daughter dar to
see 'em lay me in de grave!”</p>
          <p>Long sat Vina and her mother close together, conversing
in low tones, and weeping over their sad doom.</p>
          <p>The slaves who had been gathered around the fires
upon the bank came in, and wrapping themselves in
their blankets, lay down to sleep.</p>
          <p>As midnight approached, it was announced that the
boats would probably not leave Bainbridge until Monday
morning; and Aunt Sally obtained permission of
the overseer who had charge, to go home with her
daughter, and spend the next day which was Saturday,
at her cabin. Immediately they left the boat, and
hastened home.</p>
          <p>The hours of that short Saturday passed swiftly by,
and at night Vina accompanied her mother back to the
boat. There she left her, promising to come again in
the morning, that they might spend one more day
together.</p>
          <p>The dawn of the Sabbath-day saw the affectionate
daughter on her way to the river. She walked rapidly
for every minute of that day was precious.</p>
          <p>She comes in sight of the landing. Why does she
pause? and Oh! what means that heavy groan?</p>
          <p>The boats have gone! The fires are smouldering
<pb id="pickard149" n="149"/>
on the bank. Here and there lies a fragment of hoe-cake
or a bit of an old blanket that has been forgotten.
All is silent.</p>
          <p>Slowly the freighted boats pursued their way between
the lonely banks of the Tennessee. The trees
that overhung the stream shivered as they saw their
leafless branches in the still clear water, but the bright
mistletoe clung closely to the desolate trunks, and
strove, with its rich green, to hide their rigid outlines.</p>
          <p>Slowly they floated on. The broad Ohio bore them
on her breast to the Father of Waters, and still they
stayed not. The tall cotton-woods that guard the
Mississippi's banks listened to the murmur of the
slaves' sad voices; and every breeze they met went
sighing past as though it sorrowed with them.</p>
          <p>Their fears were all too true. The sugar farm upon
the coast was to them as the “Valley of the Shadow
of Death.”</p>
          <p>So many of his slaves died during the first year, that
Mr. Peoples, when he had made one crop of cane, sold
his plantation and left the coast. He could not endure
to see his faithful servants dying there, even though
he knew the profits of the business would enable him
to buy others in their stead. So he purchased a plantation
in the north part of Mississippi, and returned,
with the remnant of his people, to the culture of corn
and cotton.</p>
          <p>Here, after several years, Aunt Sally sank peacefully
to her last, long slumber, She had no dread of
Death. Long had she waited for his coming; and
now that she knew he hovered near, her heart was
filled with holy joy, and all who saw the light of love
and hope that beamed from her faded eye, knew well
<pb id="pickard150" n="150"/>
that she had been with Jesus. And when her pulse
was still, and her cold hands lay meekly folded across
her breast, a heavenly smile still lingered on her face;
blest token that her weary spirit had reached at length
that happy home where she had so longed to rest.</p>
          <p>Her master, who, during her sickness, had done all
in his power for her comfort, wrote to inform her absent
children of her decease. He told them of her
faith and patience, and of her final triumph over the
terrors of the grave; and added that he provided a
neat shroud and coffin for her sleeping dust, and
buried her with every token of respect.</p>
          <p>Happy Aunt Sally. She had never known other
than the “sunny side” of slavery. Neither of her
masters had been capable of wanton cruelty, and her
excellent character had made her a favorite with both.
Yet the <hi rend="italics">system</hi> of slavery cursed her life. It bereaved
her of the husband of her youth, and robbed her of her
beloved children. It tore her from scenes endeared by
association with all her pleasures, and dragged her
away into strange lands, of which, from her childhood,
she had heard nought but tales of horror.</p>
          <p>And for all these, what compensation reaped she
from the <hi rend="italics">institution</hi><corr sic=".">?</corr> Verily, none—save such as is
bestowed upon the faithful ox. Even the unusual
kindness of her master could grant no other boon than
a shroud, a coffin, and a promised letter to tell her
children that they were motherless.</p>
          <p>Such is a “<hi rend="italics">South Side View.</hi>”</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
          <head>THE MISTRESS' SECOND MARRIAGE.</head>
          <p>ON the twelfth of November, 1833, Mrs. Gist was
married to Mr. John Hogun, a man more than twenty
years her senior. He possessed few personal attractions,
and still fewer intellectual or social accomplishments.
But he owned two large plantations, one in
the neighborhood of Mrs. Gist's residence; and another
in Mississippi. Both of these were well stocked, the
slaves numbering more than one hundred.</p>
          <p>The marriage of their beloved mistress caused great
grief among the slaves on the plantation, for it foreshadowed
the partings that must come.</p>
          <p>The servants, thirty-four in number, were to be
divided equally between the mother and her four
children (one daughter was born after her father's
death). In order to this, they were placed in five lots,
and these were so arranged as to keep the families
together. These lots were not of equal value; but the
discrepancy was to be made up by a corresponding
difference in the distribution of the other property, so
that the revolting scenes of an auction might be
avoided.</p>
          <p>The mistress drew first. Old Frank, and Aunt
<pb id="pickard152" n="152"/>
Peggy, with their three daughters, together with a
yellow boy named Nelson, fell to her share. She felt
disappointed for she had always hoped to retain Peter
in her service; but notwithstanding he loved and
honored his mistress, he was grateful that he had not
fallen under the dominion of her husband. The remaining
lots were not drawn at that time, as the children
were still very young.</p>
          <p>About a month after the marriage—a sad and
gloomy month to all upon the place—Mrs. Hogun,
with her children and servants, left the quiet home
where she had spent so many happy hours, and went
to the residence of her husband.</p>
          <p>This was a large framed house, situated on a rich
plantation, about four miles from her late abode, and
four and a half miles from Tuscumbia. The former
Mrs. Hogun had been dead four or five years, and her
oldest daughter, Miss Louisa, had since her decease,
resided at her father's table. This young lady was
married soon after her father, and there were then
three children left at home, John, Robert, and Thirmuthis.</p>
          <p>Mr. Hogun was emphatically a hard man. His
heart knew no mercy to those upon whom the laws of
his State, as well as the customs; of surrounding society
allowed him to trample. To his own children he was
ever indulgent; to his neighbors and acquaintances,
smooth-tongued and polite; but he had at will that
could not brook resistance, and a temper which,
when roused, was capable of inflicting any cruelty. He
considered his servants as <hi rend="italics">his</hi>, body and soul, and stove
to compel them to make his wishes their law in all
things. He allowed none of them to marry off the
<pb id="pickard153" n="153"/>
the place, and by watching them carefully, and pursuing
prompt measures, he usually managed to bring
them together according to his mind.</p>
          <p>When he saw a young man and woman engaged in
any little sport together, or noticing each other in any
way, if he thought they would make a good match, he
ordered the overseer to build them a house. Accordingly,
on the first convenient day thereafter, a sufficient
number of the hands were called to the work, and the
cabin was erected. It was but a small task to complete
the structure—one little log-room, having a door on
one side, a small unglazed window with a wooden
shutter on the other, and at one end a chimney, built
of sticks and smeared with mud. Nothing further was
considered necessary. The ground sufficed for all the
purposes of floor, bed, table, and chairs; unless the
inmates, by working on holidays, or by selling eggs or
chickens, managed to procure some little comforts for
themselves.</p>
          <p>When the house was finished, the master ordered
Bob, the head man to bring Joe and Phillis, and put
them into their house. Then, putting a small padlock
on the door, he gave the key to Bob, saying, “Here,
Bob, I have put my seal on this door; now here is the
key; you keep this nigger and this wench together,
or, <hi rend="italics">by jings</hi>, you'll pay for it. Do you make Joe build
a fire for Phillis, and see that Phillis cooks for Joe,
and washes his clothes; and, mind, Bob, I shall look
to you.”</p>
          <p>No expostulations from either party could alter his
decree. <hi rend="italics">He had been to the trouble of building a house
for them</hi>, and now they should live in it, or take the
consequences of braving his authority.</p>
          <pb id="pickard154" n="154"/>
          <p>When such were the marriage rites, what must have
been the morals of the place?</p>
          <p>The slaves on this plantation were worked very
hard. Before the dawn of day the horn was sounded
to call them to the field, and in hurrying times, they
were not allowed to go to rest till late at night. “Cotton,”
—“cotton” was ever the watchword and reply;
and the great crops which they “made” brought wealth
into the master's coffers, while they drained the life-founts
of the toiling slaves.</p>
          <p>One year, however, they had, providentially, a little
rest. The crop was nearly destroyed by the early
frost, very few bolls ripening at all.</p>
          <p>Late in this “<hi rend="italics">unlucky</hi>” year, a gang of slaves were
one day repairing the fence around a large field, and a
few were picking the cotton from the scattering bolls.</p>
          <p>“Well, boys,” said the overseer of a neighboring
plantation, who chanced to pass, “aint you sorry you've
got no cotton to pick this year?”</p>
          <p>“Ah! no, mass'r,” replied one of the oldest men,
“we's mighty glad in place o' bein' sorry. De Lord
has done a mon's good work for us, mass'r; if he'd
on'y sent de fross a little sooner, we wouldn't had none
to pick at all.”</p>
          <p>The overseer, angered by the old man's “impudence,”
cursed him bitterly.</p>
          <p>“Yah, yah, mass'r, 'taint no use bein' mad, I reckon,
kase nobody aint to blame but de Lord, and it wont
do no good to be mad wid him; cant skeer him
cussing, no how.”</p>
          <p>For six years after the marriage of their mistress,
the slaves belonging to the Gist estate were kept upon
the plantation. The overseer with his family took
<pb id="pickard155" n="155"/>
possession of the house that had so long been the abode
of peace and happiness; and everywhere on the place
a new order of things was established.</p>
          <p>Peter was made foreman of the hands, which position
he retained as long as the family of slaves was
kept together. The overseer gave him his orders at
night with particular directions concerning the next
day's work. In the morning he was obliged to rise
first, to call his follow-servants from their slumbers,
and to see that each was in his place, and that his
his work was properly commenced. All day he took
the fore-row and led his gang. At night it was his business
to see that the tools they had used were safe and
in order, and the people were all in their cabins,
before he could go to bed. In picking time, he also
was obliged each night to weigh the cotton, and to
report to the overseer the number of pounds which
each of the hands had picked. His extraordinary
memory was now a great advantage to him, for though
he could not write, he was never known to report
erroneously the contents of the baskets.</p>
          <p>The loss of their kind master was keenly felt by the
slaves during all these years. The overseers, always
men of the lowest stamp in intellect and morals, had
full sway. If they succeeded in making a good crop,
they satisfied their employers, the administrators of the
estate; and why should they hesitate to use any means
that might advance this end? The slaves, men and
women, were therefore required to labor at their utmost
strength; and when over-wearied, they found no sympathy.
The kind word of encouragement was wanting,
the voice of commendation became strange unto
their ears.</p>
          <pb id="pickard156" n="156"/>
          <p>In the year 1839, it was thought best, by the guardians
of the estate, to sell the plantation and to hire
out the negroes. The tidings of this approaching
change in their condition spread a panic throughout the
little community. They had suffered much since their
master died, but they had suffered together. Now to
be scattered—they could not bear the thought!</p>
          <p>Many were the consultations which they held together
over their gloomy prospects; but none could suggest
a plan of escape from the ills that threatened them.
They could only submit to their fate, and meet whatever
awaited them with patience—since hope had fled.</p>
          <p>“Oh!” thought Peter, “what's the use in livin'?
Mass'r Levi's gone, and Levin; and then missus, she
must go too, and leave us all without nobody to care
whether we lives or dies. Here I've served the family
so many years; and now I must go to wait on some
strangers, that wont care for nuthin' only to git all the
work they can for their money. Oh! if they send me
off where I can't go to see Vina, it 'll kill her, sure.”</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
          <head>THE PLANTATION “BROKEN UP.”</head>
          <p>THE last Christmas came which these doomed people
were to spend together at the old place, and instead of
the mirth which usually reigned at that season, mourning
and weeping filled its hours. The slaves had all
been hired out here and there, and, after the holidays,
they were to go to their new homes. Fourteen of the
number, including Peter, were destined to spend the
ensuing year on the plantation of a Mr. Threat, about
four miles from Bainbridge.</p>
          <p>The one great dread, that of being conveyed still
further from his wife, was now removed, but otherwise
his situation was not bettered. Mr. Threat had
immigrated from Virginia, about four years before, and
had bought a small plantation. He owned no slaves,
and was therefore obliged to hire them year by year.</p>
          <p>Peter, having led the hands on the old place, was
still retained as <hi rend="italics">head-man</hi>, and his labors were in no
degree diminished. His fare too, was scanty, for the
young master was just beginning in the world, and
could ill afford an abundance of wholesome food to
other people's negroes.</p>
          <p>The Threat family, as we have said, came from Virginia,
and though the young man to whom Peter and
his companions were hired, was not rich, yet his
<pb id="pickard158" n="158"/>
parents, who resided in the neighborhood, possessed a
competency. <hi rend="italics">His mother</hi>, we should have said, for the
elder Mr. Threat had failed in business in Virginia,
and his property was all sold under the hammer. Two
brothers of his wife, men of great wealth, bid it in,
and settled it upon their sister and her children; giving
to her the entire control during her lifetime. The
family then removed to Alabama, where Mrs. Threat
assumed the reins of government. Her husband lived
with her, and she permitted her servants to wait upon
him, but in business matters, he was not consulted.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Threat kept no overseer, and hesitated not to
show her subjects that the sole authority over them
was vested in herself, and that her arm was strong
to punish their transgressions. She frequently rode
over her fields with cowhide and rope at hand, and inspected
the labor of her slaves. If she found one of
them dilatory or otherwise remiss, she quickly dismounted,
and ordered him to strip. Then after commanding
one of his fellow slaves to tie him, she vigorously
applied the cowhide to his naked back, until she
deemed that he had expiated his offence.</p>
          <p>One spring morning, while Peter was hired to her
son, she mounted one of her carriage horses, a large
bay, and rode to the field. She had, the day before,
whipped a large, powerful negro, and on this morning
she started with her rope and cowhide, intending to inflict
the same punishment upon another who had
incurred her wrath. But when she had nearly reached
the spot where her people were at work, her horse took
fright, and springing aside, threw her to the ground.
The slaves hastened to her assistance. They bore her
home, and a doctor was soon summoned. Her hip
<pb id="pickard159" n="159"/>
was badly injured, and it was a long time before she
recovered. Ever after, she used a crutch, and dragged
one foot after her when she walked. Her good right
arm, however, was not weakened, as the scarred backs
of many of her slaves could testify.</p>
          <p>This may be regarded as an extraordinary instance
of female “chivalry,” but in truth, similar cases are
not rare. Frail, delicate ladies, whom one would instinctively
shield from a rude breath of the free air,
can strip and tie their slaves, both men and women,
and beat them with the zest of a base-born overseer.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref5" n="5" rend="sc" target="note5">* </ref></p>

            <p>* In making this assertion, the writer relies not wholly upon information
derived from Peter, but speaks also from personal
knowledge.</p>
          </note>
          <p>During the summer which Peter spent at Mr.
Threat's—1840—the well remembered political excitement
of “Tippecanoe and Tyler too,” spread through
that vicinity. A Convention was held at Tuscumbia,
and party men on both sides were lead in the defence
of the liberties of their country. Speeches were made,
songs were sung; and each busy patriot seemed to
imagine himself destined to save the nation from misrule
and consequent destruction. The excitement was
contagious. Ladies' fair hands embroidered banners,
and their soft voices joined in the exciting songs of
the times.</p>
          <p>The slaves could not remain uninterested listeners
to the conversations concerning liberty that were held
everywhere—at the dinner-table, and on the street.
They interpreted <hi rend="italics">literally</hi> the language of their masters,
and in their simple hearts imagined that the dawn of
liberty had come. What else could it mean? The
white people were already free; and if liberty was to
<pb id="pickard160" n="160"/>
become universal—and people on each side declared it
would become so, if their party should succeed in the
election—then the “black folks” would enjoy its
blessings, “<hi rend="italics">sure.</hi>”</p>
          <p>On Sundays the slaves from “town” met their
plantation friends at their fish-traps on the river, and
there the joyful news was communicated—in whispers
at first—but as they became more certain that their
hopes were well-grounded, they gradually grew bolder,
till at length they dared to discuss the subject in their
religious meetings. The preachers were inspired by
this bright hope of freedom, and as it grew nearer its
imagined fulfilment they preached it to their people
with thrilling eloquence.</p>
          <p>“ 'Taint no dream, nor no joke,” cried one of these;
“de time's a'most yer. Der won't be no mo' whippin',
no mo' oversee's, no mo' <hi rend="italics">patrollers</hi>, no mo' huntin' wid
dogs; everybody's a gwine to be free, and de white
mass's a gwine to pay 'em for der work. O, my
brudders! de bressed time's a knockin' at de door!
De good Lord 'll <hi rend="italics">ramshackle</hi> de devil, and all de people
in dis yer world, bof white and black, is a gwine to
live togedder in peace.”</p>
          <p>Alas! their bright visions were speedily shadowed.
Their masters learned the subject of their earnest discussions,
and then a system of espionage was established,
which pursued its objects with a vindictive
energy worthy of the best days of the Inquisition.</p>
          <p>The black preachers were silenced; all assembling
of the slaves forbidden; and patrols established
through all the country. Every negro encountered by
the patrols was whipped, if he had no pass; and even
that important slip of paper often lost its magic, if the
<pb id="pickard161" n="161"/>
bearer chanced to have the reputation of being a man
of spirit.</p>
          <p>A panic pervaded the whole community. “The
negroes intend to rise,” was whispered with white lips
by timid ladies in their morning visits; and every sigh
of the night-wind through the lofty trees was interpreted
by the fearful into the rush of black assassins.
Old stories of negro insurrections were revived, and
the most faithful and attached servants became objects
of suspicion.</p>
          <p>This excitement, however, like that to which it owed
its origin, at length passed away. The few old privileges
were restored to the slaves, and the services of
the patrols were no longer in constant requisition. Yet
the confidence of the slaveholder is always imperfect,
and easily shaken. When injustice constitutes the
base of the system, how can faith adorn the super-structure?</p>
          <p>Some of the better class of servants about Tuscumbia
have not to this day recovered from the effects of
the suspicions which they then incurred. Many, in
their joyful excitement, had run after the wagons that
bore in procession the log cabin with its admirers, and
cried, “The year of jubilee is come! We all's a gwine
to be free!” These were almost crushed by the disappointment,
and by the sufferings consequent on
too frank an expression of their hopes. They were
scourged and persecuted <hi rend="italics">in a manner befitting the nature
of their offence.</hi></p>
          <p>Toward the close of 1840, Peter was hired for
the ensuing year to Mr. McKiernan. To this he was
greatly opposed, even though he would by such an
arrangement be able daily to enjoy the society of his
<pb id="pickard162" n="162"/>
family. He loved his wife and children most fondly,
but their master had long sought to buy him, and
Peter feared that if he went there, he might succeed in
accomplishing his wish. The idea of becoming the
property of such a man was dreadful to him, and this
fear shadowed the otherwise bright prospect of living
constantly with his beloved Vina. Yet he carefully
concealed his feelings on the subject from any that
would report them to Mr. McKiernan. His wife was
in the tyrant's power, and he dared not offend him.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
          <head>BABY LIFE IN THE CABINS.</head>
          <p>WE left Vina at the landing straining her weeping
eyes to retain the images of the flat-boats that were
bearing the <hi rend="italics">goods</hi> of Mr. Peoples down the river.
Long she stood gazing there; even till the last faint
outline of a boat was lost, and than with swollen eyes
and aching heart she returned to her cabin.</p>
          <p>She had then two children, Peter, the eldest was a
little more than three years old, and Levin, who was
born on the twenty-fourth of June previous, had seen
about six months. They were ‘<hi rend="italics">peart,</hi>’ healthy little
fellows, and they received much better care than is
usually bestowed upon the children of a field woman.</p>
          <p>At that time there was no <hi rend="italics">old woman</hi> on the place
to take care of the children; and every mother, when
she went to the field in the morning, locked her little
ones in her cabin, leaving some bread where they
could get it when they became hungry. Or, if there
was one too small to help itself to bread, the thoughtful
mother tied a little mush in a rag upon its finger
so that when, as babies will, it thrust its finger in its
mouth, it could suck, the mush through the rag, and
that would keep it quiet.</p>
          <p>Sometimes, when the day was very hot, the mothers
<pb id="pickard164" n="164"/>
left their cabin doors open, that the little ones might
have air. Then those that were able would creep out
over the low threshold, and perhaps fall asleep on the
hot ground, “Many's the time,” says Vina, “I come
home and find my baby sleepin' with the sun a beatin'
on its head, enough, 'peared like, to addle its brains.”</p>
          <p>Very few infants lived on this plantation. The
mothers were obliged to work so hard before their
birth, and so often suffered cruel beatings while in a
situation that required the utmost kindness, that most
of the children, if born alive, died in spasms when a
few days old.</p>
          <p>When Vina's children were small, not an article of
clothing was provided for them by the master, till they
were old enough to be employed in some light work
about the house. Their mother might manage to
clothe them, or let them go naked. But for the last
few years, they have lost so many in consequence of
the total lack of necessaries, that now they give each
mother clothing for her child. But if the baby dies,
every little garment must be carried back to the mistress,
not even excepting a covering for the tiny
corpse. If the mother cannot provide something to
shroud her baby, she may have it buried without.
<hi rend="italics">Those clothes</hi> must be laid by for some future necessity.</p>
          <p>In 1831, October twenty-fifth, another little voice
was heard in Vina's cabin, pleading for care. She
called the baby William, and he was a fine brave boy,
His little brothers gave him a joyous welcome, and so
did his fond parents; though, in truth, they scarcely
knew how they were to supply his baby wants. “But
'pears like,” says the mother, “every baby I had I
<pb id="pickard165" n="165"/>
growed smarter, so 't when I had three, I tuck just as
good care of 'em all as I did of the first one.”</p>
          <p>When little William was a few months old, a child
belonging to a woman named Ann, was burned to
death while its mother was away in the field at work.
It was winter, and the mother, as was necessary at that
season, had built sufficient fire to keep her half-naked
children comfortable; and then, locking her door, had
left them to amuse themselves during her absence.
When she came in, her child was lying lifeless upon
the clay hearth. It had crept too near the pretty
blaze, and had probably fallen on the burning coals.</p>
          <p>The burning of Ann's child brought about a new
order of things on the plantation. Thereafter, every
mother was required to leave her little children at the
kitchen when she went to the field, and then the cook
could mind them.</p>
          <p>One morning, not long after this law was made,
Vina was “pushed” to get out in time. She had slept
but little during the night, and she did not wake as
early as usual. So she thought she would leave the
children in the cabin till she came in to nurse her
baby, and then she would carry them to the kitchen.</p>
          <p>The other little ones were crowing and crying about
when the mistress's eye missed Vina's. She counted
them all over.</p>
          <p>“Where are Vina's children?”</p>
          <p>“She never brought 'em dis mornin', ma'am.”</p>
          <p>“Well, I'll settle with her when she comes. I've
told them all not to leave their children at home—they
don't care whether they're burnt up or not.”</p>
          <p>When Vina came at breakfast time to her cabin, (all
but the mothers of young children ate their breakfast
<pb id="pickard166" n="166"/>
before they went out) she took her three little ones to
the kitchen, and sat down there to nurse the baby<corr>.</corr>
Soon the mistress came in, holding the cowhide partly
behind her.</p>
          <p>“How's this, Vina?” said she, “I thought I told
you that you wasn't to leave your children in your
house of a morning.”</p>
          <p>“Well, Missus, I's pushed this mornin'. I hadn't
time—”</p>
          <p>“I don't care how much you was pushed. I told
you to bring them here; and if the sun was an hour
high you should obey me. Lay down your child;
I'm going to whip you now, for I said I would do it.
If your children had got burnt up, you would have
blamed me about it.”</p>
          <p>“No, ma'am, I wouldn't—”</p>
          <p>“Lay your child down. I'll let you know you are
to obey me.”</p>
          <p>Vina obeyed; and when her weary shoulders had
received twenty hard lashes, she went out to her work.
Verily, as a lady in that neighborhood remarked, not
long since, to a Northern friend: “<hi rend="italics">The negroes ought
to be very thankful to us for taking care of them: they
make us a great deal of trouble.</hi>”</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
          <head>FACTS.</head>
          <p>AMONG the slaves on Mr. McKiernan's plantation
were a number of handsome women. Of these the
master was extremely fond, and many of them he beguiled
with vile flatteries, and cheated. by false promises
of future kindness, till they, became victims to his
unbridled passions.</p>
          <p>Upon these unfortunate women fell the heavy hatred
of their mistress; and year after year, as new instances
of her husband's perfidy came to her knowledge, her
jealousy ran higher, till at length reason seemed banished
from her mind, and kindliness became a stranger
to her heart. Then she sought a solace in the wine-cup;
and the demon of intoxication fanned the fires
of hatred that burned within her, till they consumed
all that was womanly in her nature, and rendered her
an object of contempt and ridicule, even among her
own dependents.</p>
          <p>The master was, at the time of which we are writing,
not far from fifty years of age. He was short and
burly in person, with a large head, and a very red
face. His hair was quite grey, and as he walked
towards the quarter in the morning with his hat on
one side, cursing and spitting with equal zeal, he
<pb id="pickard168" n="168"/>
looked, as some of his slaves remarked, “like a big buzzard
just ready to fly.”</p>
          <p>Vina thoroughly understood her master's character;
she knew also the temper of her mistress; and she
strove by her prudence and correctness of demeanor,
to avoid exciting the evil passions of either. But one
day, when William was a baby, her trial came. The
following is her own account of her contest with her
master, and it shows that she possessed a brave, true
spirit:</p>
          <p>“I was in my house a spinnin' one rainy day, and
firs' I knowed, Mass'r he come to the door, and ax me
what was I doin'. I told him I's a spinnin' fine yarn.
‘Who's thar with you?’ says he, ‘Thar aint no person
yer but my chillerns,’ says I; and so he come in
and sent Peter and Levin out. I knowed what was a
comin' then, for his eyes looked mighty mean.</p>
          <p>“He sot down and talked till I got tired a hearin',
and I told him I wished he'd go 'way and leave me
alone. I told him he got a wife o' his own, and I
didn't never want no fuss with her. Well, he 'lowed
she wouldn't never know nothin' about it, no how, so
it wouldn't do her no hurt.</p>
          <p>“I told him that thar wasn't my principle, to wrong
any person behind their back, thinkin' they wouldn't
know it. I wouldn't like any body should do me so.
At las' I told him I got a task to do, and if he wouldn't
go off, and let me do it, I'd go myself;—so I started
for the door.</p>
          <p>“He sprung after me, and cotch me by the neck of
my coat, and tore it half way down the skirt behind.
That made me mad, and I fell at him, and tore his
<pb id="pickard169" n="169"/>
shirt mighty nigh off his back. I pulled his hair too,
right smart, and scratched his face, and then tripped
and flung him on the floor.</p>
          <p>He was powerful mad when he got up, and he say
he gwine whip me well for that. I told him just so
sure as he give me a lick, I'd tell Missus what it's for;
and he knowed he never'd git no chance to whip me
'bout my work, so he needn't make no such pretence.
‘You tell her one word,’ says he,‘ 'bout this yer, and
I'll cut your two ears off close to your head!’ ‘No,
sir, you wont,’ says I, ‘I you know you dares not crap
one of your servants.’</p>
          <p>“Then he went up to the house, and slipped in sly,
and put on a clean shirt. But that thar raggety one
never was seen. His wife missed it, though, for she
knowed he put on a clean shirt that day. She axed
all the house servants had they seen it, but none of
'em didn't know nuthin' 'bout it. Then she 'lowed
some of 'em done stole it, and she laid it to Jinny,—
she was cook then. She 'lowed she done give it to
Jacob her husband. They both 'clared they's innocent;
but the missus and the overseer give 'em more'n
three hundred lashes to make 'em own they got it.</p>
          <p>“ ‘One of your best shirts is gone,’ says she to the
Mass'r, ‘and I'm determined to whip the servants till
I make them tell where it is. I've had Jinny and
Jacob whipped well, but they wont own any thing
about it. I shall have to try the others!’</p>
          <p>“ ‘Jinny,’ says Mass'r, ‘what about that shirt of
mine?<corr>’</corr></p>
          <p>“ ‘Missus has whipped me 'bout that shirt, sir,’ says
Jinny, ‘an' I don't know no more 'bout whar it is an'
you does yourself.’</p>
          <pb id="pickard170" n="170"/>
          <p>“ ‘Well, go 'long,’ says he, ‘but mind, Jinny, you've
got that to find.’</p>
          <p>“All the house servants got whipped 'bout it, but
none of 'em didn't take so much as Jinny; and they
had every house in the quarter searched. There was
more'n five hundred blows struck 'bout that shirt, and
they never found no sign of it.</p>
          <p>“Two or three weeks after, old Mass'r come into
the field to whar we's plowin'! He tried some o' the
other women's ploughs, and then he come to me.
‘Well, girl,’ says he, ‘how does your plough run?<corr>’</corr></p>
          <p>“ ‘Oh! it runs well enough,’ says I.</p>
          <p>“ ‘Let me try it,’ says he.</p>
          <p>“ ‘I don't want nobody a holdin' my plough’', says I.</p>
          <p>“ ‘The devil you don't!’ I see he's gittin' mad; so
I stepped back and drapped the line. He cotch it,
and ploughed a few rods. ‘What you think now,’
says he ‘of a servant fightin' her master?’</p>
          <p>“ ‘What you think, sir, 'bout a Mass'r doin' his
servants that way?’ says I. ‘You see 'em misbehave
with any body else, and you'd whip 'em sure!<corr>’</corr></p>
          <p>“ ‘Yes, but <hi rend="italics">I'm</hi> your<hi rend="italics"> master</hi>.’</p>
          <p>“ ‘That don't make no difference to me, sir,’ says I.
‘How could you see your poor house servants cut up
so 'bout that shirt, and you knowin' whar it was all
the time? I b'lieve I'll go up this very night, and
tell 'em all about it.’</p>
          <p>“ ‘By G—d,’ says he, ‘I wish you would. I'd like
to have you tell it, I'd give you the devil.’</p>
          <p>“But I didn't have no notion o' tellin'! They had
storms enough without havin' any 'bout me, and I
knowed I could allers keep him away by fightin' him.
I liked to fight him a little, anyhow, he's so mean. If I'd
<pb id="pickard171" n="171"/>
told, I'd allers had Missus agin me, and they mought
'a' sold me away from my family, and that would 'a'
been the end o' me.”</p>
          <p>Vina's wisdom in refraining from reporting to her
mistress, may be inferred from the following incident,
with the circumstances of which she was well acquainted.</p>
          <p>Jinny, the cook, had a young daughter named
Maria. She was small of her age, a bright mulatto,
and uncommonly pretty; and her mistress had always
kept her about the house.</p>
          <p>One morning, when Maria was about thirteen years
old, the mistress called her to perform some little
service, but she did not answer. She sent to the
kitchen, but she was not there, and, thinking she had
perhaps fallen asleep somewhere in the house, the lady
proceeded to look for her in the different rooms. She
opened the parlor door, and there was the child—
with her master.</p>
          <p>All the fierceness of her nature was aroused. Her
husband immediately mounted his horse, and rode off
to escape the storm; though well he knew that its full
fury would fall upon the young head of his victim.</p>
          <p>The enraged woman seized the trembling child and
put her in a buck. Then she whipped her till she was
tired, but not satisfied; for as soon as she had rested
her weary arms, she flew at her again, and after beating
her till she had exhausted her own strength a
second time, she shut her up in the brick smoke-house.</p>
          <p>The matter was no secret, for she told the story to
all the servants, and to every one else who chanced to
come to the house while her wrath was burning.</p>
          <pb id="pickard172" n="172"/>
          <p>For two weeks she kept the poor girl constantly imprisoned
there, except that every day she took her out
long enough to whip her. She gave her nothing to
eat or drink, and all the light or air that could enter
the gloomy place came through the small holes that
were left by the builders to admit air to the bacon.
Through these, Jinny, when she could steal an opportunity,
passed small pieces of bread, and a little water
in a vial, that her child might not die of hunger.</p>
          <p>Some of the elderly servants, expostulated with their
mistress, and even hinted that Maria was but a child,
and that it was “mass'r” that was to blame. “She'll
know better in future,” was the stern reply; “after I've
done with her, she'll never do the like again through
ignorance.”</p>
          <p>“But she'll die, missus, if you keeps her shut up
thar much longer.”</p>
          <p>“That's just what I want; I hope she will die.”</p>
          <p>The poor child grew very thin and pale, and sometimes,
when she was taken out to receive her daily
whipping she could hardly stand. “O missus,” said
she one day, “if you whips me any more it will kill
me.”</p>
          <p>“That's just what I want; I hope it will;” was the
only reply. But some merciful angel restrained her
cruel arm for that one day, and she thrust her back
without beating her.</p>
          <p>“Please, missus, wont you let me have a drink of
water?” said the child, as the door was once more
about to close upon her.</p>
          <p>“No; not a drop of water shall you have, nor a
mouthful to eat;” and she shut the door upon the
youthful sufferer.</p>
          <pb id="pickard173" n="173"/>
          <p>After she had kept her thus imprisoned for two
weeks, her eldest son, Master Charles, came from
Louisiana on a visit. To him his mother told the story
of <hi rend="italics">Maria's depravity</hi>, and begged him to take her away
with him. “Sell her,” said she, “to the hardest master
you can find, for, if she stays here, I shall certainly
kill her.”</p>
          <p>Master Charles readily assented to his mother's proposal,
and proceeded at once to the smoke-house to let
Maria out. Poor child, how changed was she from
the bright young girl of two weeks before! Her face
had now an ashy line, and her large eyes were dull
and sunken. Her flesh, too, was all gone; so that she
was indeed frightful to look at.</p>
          <p>“Why, mother,” said the young man, “you must
have this girl fattened up or she will never sell, I
should be ashamed to offer her for sale looking as she
does now.”</p>
          <p>The mistress went to the kitchen. “Jinny,” said
she, “I want you to feed <hi rend="italics">my young mistress</hi> well, and
fatten her for the market.”</p>
          <p>Poor Jinny was greatly distressed, and as soon as
she could find him alone, she begged young Master
Charles not to sell her child.</p>
          <p>“O Aunt Jinny,” said he, “I am not going to sell
her. I want to take her home with me, to get her
away from the old lady. I shall keep her myself, and
I'll take good care of her.</p>
          <p>The young man kept his word. He took her to
Louisiana, and kept her till she had recovered her
health and her good looks. Then he hired her out to
a lady of his acquaintance, who taught her to sew, and
she became an excellent seamstress. A few years after,
<pb id="pickard174" n="174"/>
when he came home on a visit, he brought her with
him that she might see her mother. She was then a
large, fine looking woman, so changed from the poor
persecuted child that left them, that her friends could
scarcely credit her identity. Yet, though years had
passed, she dared not come into the presence of her
angered mistress. Master Charles left her at his sister's;
and only when her enemy had left the plantation for
the day, did Maria venture to steal a visit to her early
friends.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
          <head>PETER'S YEAR AT McKIERNAN'S.</head>
          <p>ON the first day of January 1841, Peter commenced
his labors on the plantation of Mr. McKiernan. Now
came his most intimate acquaintance with the realities
of slavery. He had witnessed much suffering both in
Kentucky, and also since his removal to Alabama; and
had even endured, in his own person, enough to give
him some idea of the meaning of the word <hi rend="italics">slave</hi>, but
never did he comprehend its full, fearful import till he
learned it here.</p>
          <p>Not that he suffered personal abuse, for aside from two
or three violent cursings, he received during the year, no
unkind treatment. This exemption he owed partly to
his own cautious avoidance of any act or word that could
annoy his irritable master; and partly, no doubt, to the
fact that Mr. McKiernan wished to buy him, but was
well aware that he could not purchased from the
estate of his late master without his own consent. Mrs.
Hogun, his former mistress, was still his kindest friend;
and though she had now no real authority over any of
the slaves except the six that had been allotted to herself,
she still possessed great influence with those who
managed the estate; and she would never sanction the
sale, against his will, of one of her favorite servants.
<pb id="pickard176" n="176"/>
So Mr. McKiernan was wondrous kind to Peter. He
employed him during part of the year as moulder in
making brick, with the professed intention of building
new brick cabins for his people; but to this day the
old log huts remain their habitations.</p>
          <p>It was not in personal sufferings or privations that
Peter found the bitterest woes of slavery. It was the
stifling influence of the deep degradation of his race
that most oppressed his spirit. The moral malaria of
the place filled his blood with hatred of the oppressions
by which it was engendered; and his own consciousness
of higher aspirations than those indulged who
called themselves his masters taught him that, though
his skin was black, they were, in truth, beneath him
in all that constitutes a man.</p>
          <p>But though Peter found much to sadden his spirit
while he remained on Mr. McKiernan's place, his constant
presence there was a rich blessing to his family.</p>
          <p>Vina had now, in addition to the three children we
have previously named, a little daughter about three
years old. She had, during the autumn of 1883, buried
a baby a week old; and little Silas, after remaining
with her just one year, was borne away to the hill-side
in August, 1836. Again in March, 1840, a little
daughter, five months, old, was strangled by the croup.</p>
          <p>In July, 1841, another little boy was welcomed to
their humble cabin. They called him Bernard, and
for three years he remained the pet of all the little
household. Then he was seized with spasms—and
soon his merry voice was hushed, and his little form
grew cold and stiff in death.</p>
          <p>The three boys, Peter, Levin and William, were
now old enough to work on the plantation, and their
<pb id="pickard177" n="177"/>
obedience and kindness to their mother fully rewarded
all the care she had bestowed upon them. Yet she
was forced even now to labor very hard to keep them
comfortably clad. She made all their clothes herself,
and washed and mended them by night. Their stockings,
too, she knit, though she was obliged first to card
the wool and spin it. Of this the slaves had usually
as much as they needed for stockings, <hi rend="italics">if they could get
time to manufacture it</hi>. The master had plenty of
sheep, and was not in the habit of selling the wool.</p>
          <p>All the fragments of their worn-out clothes the careful
mother saved, and pieced them into bed-quilts.
She managed to get help to quilt these, by inviting in
the other women on Saturday nights. They were not
allowed to leave their cabins after the blowing of the
horn for them to go to bed; but they were welcome
to sit up and work till morning, if they could furnish
themselves with lights.</p>
          <p>Thus, in exhausting and continual toil, had passed
the years of Vina's motherhood. Her husband had
been unable to share her cares, except on Sundays,
when he had done all he could to aid her in her labors.
No wonder she was glad when every night his smile
brightened her cabin, and his pleasant voice beguiled
her hour of toil; and yet, in her unselfish heart, she
wished his lot had fallen elsewhere.</p>
          <p>Peter, as we have seen, had been long accustomed
to plantation life; and, during the ten years
that had elapsed since his master's death, he had seen
many hardships. But still, the kindness of his mistress
had never failed him; and even when she no
longer possessed the power to ameliorate his condition,
the knowledge that she pitied him, and exerted all
<pb id="pickard178" n="178"/>
her influence in his behalf, endued him with new
strength to bear his troubles. But on this plantation
a phase of slave-life was presented for his observance,
new, and more revolting than any he had elsewhere
witnessed; for here the women suffered most, and
oftenest by their mistress' hand, or in obedience to her
orders.</p>
          <p>The main house-servant, at this time, was Ann Eliza,
whom with her husband, Edward, Mr. McKiernan had
bought several years before in Mississippi. She knew
how to read well, understood all the branches of good
housewifery, and was withal possessed of excellent
sense and real piety. Yet, although her services in
the house were invaluable, and her conduct was above
reproach, her mistress hated her. <hi rend="italics">She was too handsome,
and had “such a tongue!”</hi></p>
          <p>Ann Eliza was not impudent or bold; but when
her mistress violently upbraided her, and accused her
falsely, she threw back her head, and fixed her large,
clear eyes upon her face, while with a steady voice she
declared her innocence. This dignified defence the
passionate lady could only answer with the cowhide,
and she frequently exhausted her own strength in
fruitless efforts to subdue the spirit of her slave.</p>
          <p>Once, during the year that Peter spent there, the
mistress, as a punishment for some offence, sent Ann
Eliza to the gin-house, to assist in moving a quantity
of cotton. After she had gone, a messenger was
despatched for a man named Anderson, who was in
the habit of attending to any necessary business on the
place during the master's absence.</p>
          <p>“Look here, Mr. Anderson,” said the lady, when
that personage presented himself before her, “I want
<pb id="pickard179" n="179"/>
you to go to the gin-house, and get Ann Eliza, and
give her one good whipping. I have whipped her
myself till I am tired, but it does no good. She needs
bringing down, for she is the torment of my life. Lay
it on well; you needn't be afraid. It is a good time
now, as Mr. McKiernan is away from home. He is
mighty careful of the pretty girl, himself, and that is
what makes her so impudent.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, ma'am,” replied Anderson, “I'll give her a
lesson she'll remember;” and he departed to the gin-house.</p>
          <p>Ann Eliza saw him coming, and she knew her
doom. She cast one imploring look at her husband,
who was working at her side. Edward returned it
with a glance so full of terror, pity, and an intense
longing to avenge her wrongs, that all her powers
were roused, and she felt strong to endure the worst.</p>
          <p>She stood calmly by her husband's side, while, with
his rope, the ruffian bound her hands; and then, at
his command, she followed him towards the house,
leaving poor Edward gazing after her in silent terror.
One moment a flash of vengeance gleamed from his
dark eyes; and then he realized his utter helplessness,
and his head drooped low, while great tears fell upon
the heap of cotton.</p>
          <p>Peter stood in the shelter of one of the out-buildings,
and watched Anderson as he led his victim to the
orchard. There he “staked her out” upon the ground,
and, with a zest unknown to <hi rend="italics">uncultivated natures</hi>, he
applied the cowhide to her naked back and limbs.
Her screams of agony only excited his demoniac mirth.
“That's right,” he cried, “I like to hear you shout;
<pb id="pickard180" n="180"/>
that's the way ye all shout at the camp-ground.
Shout away! you're gittin' happy now.”</p>
          <p>He beat her there, mockin' the while her cries of
pain, till she became too much exhausted to utter another
sound; and then, untying her, he delivered her
to her mistress. “Thar, ma'am,” said he, “she ain't
got use for no more this time. She's got the devil in
her, but I reckon he'll keep still till she gits over this
ere.”</p>
          <p>Much religious excitement existed at this time
among the slaves in the neighborhood, and particularly
upon the plantation of Mr. McKiernan. An old
Baptist preacher, named Archie Eggleston, had been
hired here the preceding year; and he had zealously
preached to his brethren in bonds the love and compassion
of Jesus; and had sought, in his simple way,
to encourage them to hope for a home among “the
spirits bright.” His language, it is true, was full of
the quaint idioms of his race; but it spoke to the hearts
of his unlearned auditory; for the little which he
could tell them of the blessed Saviour was just what
they loved to hear. They “received the word with
gladness,” and, with its warm and cheering rays, it
illumined their darkness, and strewed the thorny path
they trod, not with the roses of content, but with the
trembling violets of hope.</p>
          <p>Sweet, when their daily toil was done, was the hour
which, borrowed from their needed rest, they spent
alone in prayer; and, as the breath of their humble
souls ascended on the soft air of evening, their trusting
hearts were filled with heavenly consolations.</p>
          <pb id="pickard181" n="181"/>
          <p>But even these few precious moments were not undisturbed,
if the overseer or young Master Charles
discovered their retreat. “Ye all needn't pretend to
be praying, when you're just hiding around to get a
chance to steal; take that—and learn to stay at home
of nights!”</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
          <head>BURTON'S REIGN</head>
          <p>THE overseer on Mr. McKiernan's place was usually
a representative of the lowest order of his profession.
The master could tolerate no other, and those of the
better class would not remain in his employ. If, by
chance, he hired one of a higher grade than the brutish
fellows to whom his business was wont to be intrusted,
his stay was short.</p>
          <p>“Why don't you put on some decent clothes?” said
such a one to a half-naked negro, soon after he entered
upon his duties in the field.</p>
          <p>“Ain't got none but dese yer, sir.”</p>
          <p>“Where's the clothes your master gave you this
fall?”</p>
          <p>“He ain't never give us no clothes, sir, in more'n a
year.”</p>
          <p>“Humph! I'll not have anything to do with his
lousy niggers; I shall get lousy myself.”</p>
          <p>“Mr. McKiernan, I can't do business for you; your
niggers are too filthy and ragged; I can't oversee such
a gang.”</p>
          <p>“Well, I'm going to get them new clothes soon;
I've been intending to get some this long time, but it
has been neglected.”</p>
          <pb id="pickard183" n="183"/>
          <p>Nothing more was heard of them, however, and the
scrupulous overseer found another situation, leaving
his place to be filled by one whose tastes accorded better
with those of the old master.</p>
          <p>One of this latter class was employed upon the place
a few years after Peter's sojourn there, who had so
keen a relish for the varieties of his profession that a
few instances of his reign should be related here.</p>
          <p>His name was Burton. He was a tall, dark man
with grey hair, and shaggy eye-brows, as fierce and
disagreeable in countenance as he was cruel and hard
of heart.</p>
          <p>He came on Saturday, and commenced business on
Sunday morning by summoning all the hands to listen
to his rules.</p>
          <p>“D'ye all hear? Every man of you must get your
axe and saw, and go to the woods, and chop and saw
logs for boards. And you girls, get your mattocks
and handspikes, and go on the new ground and grub;
and, d'ye hear? mend every log-heap, and every
brush heap there. And mind; the same's to be the
law for every Sunday morning. Ye all are to work
till noon, and after that you may go the devil.”</p>
          <p>The sable company gazed at each other in blank
amazement. They had been “pushed” when they had
been allowed to wash and mend, and work their patches
on the holy day, but now—</p>
          <p>The silence was interrupted by one of their number,
named Lewis, a very black man with a round face and
heavy figure, who stepped forward, and said, as he
looked the new overseer firmly in the face,—“Well,
Sir, de res' cun do as dey likes, but dis chile aint gwine
to do it.”</p>
          <pb id="pickard184" n="184"/>
          <p>“You tell me,” cried Burton, “that you're not going
to do it?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Sir, I tell you I wont do it. I aint gwine to
work a Sunday for no man.”</p>
          <p>“Very well—v-e-r-y w-e-l-l.” The enraged over-seer
turned his fiery eyes upon the other slaves, and saw
that they obeyed his orders. With rolling eyes and
pouting lips they all went in their dirty clothes to work.</p>
          <p>Till noon they labored; none dared a moment to lag,
for the monster with his heavy whip was near. At twelve
they returned tired and angry to the quarter. They
were unwashed, their cabins were untidy, but they had
no heart to move; and there they sat in sullen silence.</p>
          <p>Presently, the overseer summoned five or six of the
strongest men to go and help him “take that gentleman
that would'nt work on Sunday.”</p>
          <p>They dared not disobey. Burton took a rope, and,
attended by these unwilling aids, entered the cabin of
Lewis. He did not look up as they went in, but sat
with his head inclined, and with a look of fierce decision
on his face. They approached to bind him.
Instantly he sprang to his feet, and fought like a tiger.</p>
          <p>For half an hour the uproar in the house continued;
and then they brought poor Lewis out, wound up in
ropes.</p>
          <p>The cabins were built in a hollow square, one side
of which was formed by the overseer's house and garden.
Into the centre of this square Burton led his
victim, and there in sight of all the slaves, he stripped
him entirely naked, and then whipped him till the blood
streamed from his back. Then commanding, as before,
other negroes to his aid, he led him to the smoke-house,
and put him in the stocks.</p>
          <pb id="pickard185" n="185"/>
          <p>Those consisted of two heavy timbers, with mortice
hole cut in each, through which they thrust the hands,
and feet of the offender, securing them by heavy iron
bolts at each end of the timbers.</p>
          <p>Thus the pitying slaves confined their mangled brother.
Alas! they had no power to aid him, and they
dared not refuse to obey the orders of the overseer,
though every appealing look of their suffering companion
was a dagger to their hearts.</p>
          <p>After supper that night, a light was seen gleaming
through the small apertures in the smoke-house wall;
and some of the slaves peeped in. Burton sat composedly
in a chair which was kept there for the convenience
of overseers on like occasions, and as his
cowhide, with a sharp twang fell on his prostrate victim,
they heard his muttered curses mingle with the
sufferer's groans. “Well,” whispered one of these
curious listeners, “I gives it up. Der aint no use
talkin' 'bout de Lord's orderin' all things; kase its plain
to my comperhendin' dat nobody sent dat dar ole feller
yer but the devil himself. De Lord knowed we done
seen hard times enough on dis yer place; we didn't
need no more o' dat sort.”</p>
          <p>The next day at noon, Burton let the offender out,
and ordered him to go to work.</p>
          <p>“I aint able to work,” growled Lewis.</p>
          <p>“But you shall work,” rejoined the overseer,“ or I'll
give you more of the same sort.”</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding this threat, Lewis went to his cabin,
and there day after day he sat brooding over his injuries.</p>
          <p>“How long are you going to sit there, you d—d
sulky nigger?” cried Burton at the cabin door.</p>
          <pb id="pickard186" n="186"/>
          <p>“I's gwine stay yer till I gits well, and den I's
gwine to de woods.”</p>
          <p>Lewis kept his word. A day or two after this, he
rose in the morning at the sound of the horn, and
went out. Soon after Burton appeared at the door.
“Where's Lewis?” demanded he, of Lucy, his wife,
who was preparing to go to her work.</p>
          <p>“I don' know, sir, I reckon he's some're 'bout de
yard.”</p>
          <p>The day wore on, but no Lewis appeared. “I tell
you, my lady,” said Burton to Lucy, “I'll fetch the
truth out of you.” So saying, he seized her, and tying
her arms around a stump, whipped her cruelly. But
thus he gained no knowledge of her husband for she
still protested that she supposed he had only gone into
the yard.</p>
          <p>Week after week passed on, and yet no tidings came
of Lewis; but he was not alone, for soon a man named
Frank, and “old man John,” were driven by Burton's
cruelty to join him in his “den.”</p>
          <p>Yet the cowhide of the overseer had no rest; for so
dearly did he love its music, that a day seldom passed
on which he could find no occasion for its use.</p>
          <p>Young Peter was one day suffering from a severe
toothache, and he quit his work, and sought his mother's
cabin. It was a busy time, for they were to
kill hogs the next day.</p>
          <p>He had been in the house but a short time, when
Burton came to the door and bade him go and help to
make the necessary preparations for the morrow.
“I can't work, sir,” said he, “my tooth aches too bad.”</p>
          <p>“Well,” said the overseer, “come along to my house,
d—n you, and I'll cure it, or knock it out—one.”</p>
          <pb id="pickard187" n="187"/>
          <p>“If that be the case, sir,” said Peter, “I wont go;
for I aint gwine have my teeth knocked out like I was
a horse or a hog.”</p>
          <p>“So you tell me you wont, young man—v-e-r-y
w-e-l-l.”</p>
          <p>The next morning Peter, having been kept awake
nearly all night by his tooth, did not go out till sunrise,
though he was called soon after midnight. Meantime,
the master visited the scene of slaughter.</p>
          <p>“Master Peter is laid up with the tooth-ache,” said
Burton to his employer, ”and I told him yesterday if
he would come to my house, I would give him something
to ease it; but the young gentleman told me he
would not.”</p>
          <p>Vina stood near, and as she had heard the conversation
the day before, she determined, if possible, to
shield her son from the impending storm. She had
always been a most useful servant; and since, the time
when the overseer Simms had so nearly murdered her,
the master had not suffered her to be beaten. So with
a consciousness of her own high standing in his esteem,
she boldly repeated, in his presence, the precise language,
which the overseer had used to Peter.</p>
          <p>“You told him,” said she, “to come to your house,
and you'd cure it or knock it out; and he said, if that
was the case, he wasn't gwine come, kase he didn't
want his teeth knocked out like he was a horse.”</p>
          <p>Burton gave her an angry scowl. “Was I talking
to you?” said he.</p>
          <p>“No, sir, but you's tryin' to git Peter whipped, just
for nuthin?”</p>
          <p>“Hush your mouth!” cried her master.</p>
          <pb id="pickard188" n="188"/>
          <p>“I told the truth, sir,” said she, nothing daunted,
and looking him earnestly in the face.</p>
          <p>After awhile, Peter came out. “What's that impudence
you were giving to Mr. Burton last night,
telling him you wouldn't?”said the master.</p>
          <p>The young man repeated the conversation.</p>
          <p>“Well,” said Mr. McKiernan, turning to the over-seer,
“you can tie him up to that apple tree.”</p>
          <p>Burton needed nothing further. He quickly tied
Peter to the tree, and gave him a hundred lashes, after
which he ordered him to go to work.</p>
          <p>This scene was highly amusing to the master, who
often told the story with great glee; swearing that the
best cure he ever knew for a nigger's tooth-ache was to
tie him up to a tree, and “give him the devil.”</p>
          <p>For three months no trace was found of the three
runaways, though many days were spent in hunting
them, and no means were left untried to induce their
fellow-slaves to betray them to their foes. Their wives,
from the time of their flight, received weekly but half
their usual allowance of meat, that they might have
no surplus “to feed the rascals.” “Go out and hunt
them,” said Burton, when they complained of the scanty
fare, “and when you bring them in, your allowance
shall be made up to you.”</p>
          <p>The master at last despaired of taking them by
ordinary means, and he resolved to try a desperate
measure; one that should frighten all the others who
might thereafter be tempted to try the woods.</p>
          <p>About half way to Courtland lived a negro-hunter,
named Elliott, and Mr. McKiernan now sent for him
to come and catch his runaways. Elliott promptly
<pb id="pickard189" n="189"/>
obeyed the summons; bringing with him his trained
dogs—seven hounds and a bull-dog.</p>
          <p>He arrived just before supper, and early the next
morning the hunt was to commence. That night Frank
came to the quarter. His friends informed him that
the dogs had come, and bade him haste to flee beyond
their reach. But he was very swift of foot, and he felt
sure he could outrun them. He however, hastened,
back to the “den” which the three occupied together,
and told the news to his companions, Lewis, and “old
man John.”</p>
          <p>Lewis lost no time in fleeing beyond their scent.
The dawn of the next morning found him in the
woods near La Grange, distant from their rendezvous
about seven miles.</p>
          <p>Early in the morning the party, composed of Mr.
McKiernan, Elliott, and a slave named Vollen, started
on the hunt. They were mounted on the swiftest
horses the place could boast, and the dogs with their
noses to the earth, silently followed them.</p>
          <p>They passed the gang of slaves just going out to
work, and from many a heart the fervent prayer went
up to Heaven that they might miss their prey.</p>
          <p>Late in the afternoon the baying of the dogs was
heard. “Thar,” said Vina to the woman who was
plowing next her, “I'll lay anything they's started one
o' the poor fellers.”</p>
          <p>The horrid sounds came nearer—the hunters' yells
mingled with the dogs' loud baying; and as all eyes
were turned in the direction of the woods, a man
bounded over the high fence, and ran with desperate
speed into the midst of the excited slaves. The frightened
<pb id="pickard190" n="190"/>
mules set up their ears, and ran furiously through
the field, dragging the plows behind them over the
young corn.</p>
          <p>“Hold on! Hold on!” cried the master, who rode
close behind poor Frank; “don't let 'em run!”</p>
          <p>But few tried to obey, and those few were dragged
at full length along the ground, adding by their shouts
and cries, to the confusion of the scene.</p>
          <p>“Take off de dogs! call 'em off! dey's killin' me!”
cried Frank.</p>
          <p>“Let 'em go!” shouted his master;“who cares if
they do kill him! He's made me more expense and
trouble than his neck's worth.”</p>
          <p>The bull-dog, with the, ferocity of his race, kept
close to the poor fellow's legs, and tore great pieces of
flesh out of them as he ran. At last Frank seized a
stick that lay across his path, and attempted to beat
him off. Up rode Elliott. “You d—d rascal! how
dare you strike my dog?” So saying he gave him
several blows over the head and neck, that sent the
blood gushing out.</p>
          <p>“Mercy! Mercy!” cried the slave, “you're killin'
me!”</p>
          <p>“I mean to kill you, you black cuss.”</p>
          <p>When they called off the dogs, and started for the
house, poor Frank, faint with fatigue and loss of blood,
could walk no further; so the master commanded one
of the men to take his mule out of the plow and carry
him to the house.</p>
          <p>They lifted him, all covered with blood, upon the
mule, and when they reached the quarter Mr. McKiernan
delivered him to the overseer. “Here, Burton, is
<pb id="pickard191" n="191"/>
one of your runaways—Elliott says he'll bring in the
other two to-morrow, if they're any where this side of
h—ll.”</p>
          <p>Burton ordered the slaves to go on with him to the
smoke-house, and put him in the stocks.</p>
          <p>The next day the overseer went in to “take his
satisfaction.” He first fastened the hands of his victim
in their mortise; and then, sitting down, whipped him
till his demoniac rage was “satisfied.”</p>
          <p>For several days thereafter, Frank was left in the
stocks. His wounds inflamed, his bruises festered, and
at last he told the overseer, who daily paid him a visit,
that if he did not have his legs dressed where the dogs
had bitten him, he should die, “sho 'nough.” Burton
made no reply, but the next day he took him out of
the stocks, and let him go.</p>
          <p>For two months he remained in his cabin; and
though his wife had dressed his wounds with the greatest
care, five of them were still unhealed. Then the
order came for him to go to work; and though he was
still very weak, he dared not refuse obedience. “<hi rend="italics">He
had lost a heap o' time, but mass'r 'lowed his example
would skeer the others, so't they'd keep out o' the woods.</hi>”</p>
          <p>Burton swore, when he released him, that he should
work every Sunday in the year to make up lost time;
and for five Sundays, he kept him all day in the field,
visiting him occasionally, to see that he was not idle.
After that, however, he was released at noon with his
companions.</p>
          <p>The next day after Frank was taken, “old man
John” was brought in. He was not torn by the dogs,
for on their approach he climbed a tree, where he remained
<pb id="pickard192" n="192"/>
till Elliott called them off. No trace of Lewis
was discovered, and the hunter, with his dogs, went
home.</p>
          <p>About a fortnight after this, at midnight, Lewis
came to Vollen's house. This was a cabin, near the
kitchen; Vollen's wife being one of the house servants.</p>
          <p>“Is you come in to stay?” said Vollen.</p>
          <p>“Don' know; think I better?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, I reckon you mought as well, for de dogs
done tore Frank a'most to pieces.”</p>
          <p>“What you reckon dey'll do if I comes back?”</p>
          <p>“Don' know; best ax ole mass'r—I'll go tell him
you done come in.”</p>
          <p>Soon the master came to the door. “Well, Lewis,”
said he, “you had your race? Come back to stay,
eh?”</p>
          <p>“I don know, sir, I'll stay ef I can be left alone,
and not git whipped to death.”</p>
          <p>“Well, you go to the kitchen and wait till morning.”</p>
          <p>The slave obeyed, though with many misgivings.
Something within urged him to flee; but then he
could not believe his master would allow him to be
beaten more. It surely would not be for his interest
to render him unfit for labor at a season when all the
the forces he could summon were needed in the field.</p>
          <p>The master rose at dawn; and sent a note to Burton,
saying that Lewis had come in, and desiring him to
come up “soon.”</p>
          <p>Promptly, with rope in hand, the overseer presented
himself at the kitchen door. Lewis threw at him a
glance of angry defiance. “No!” cried he, as Burton
<pb id="pickard193" n="193"/>
attempted to tie him, “my mass'r yer;—he cun kill
me if he will; but you shan't tie me, nor whip me—
nary one. You's done enough o' dat dar.”</p>
          <p>“Cross your hands!” shouted Mr. McKiernan.</p>
          <p>“Very well;” responded the slave, “If mass'r says
so, you cun do it; but if he wasn't her, I'd die fus.”</p>
          <p>“Lewis,” said his master, “I want Mr. Burton to
make me a crop; and how can he do it, if you all are
off to the woods?”</p>
          <p>“I'se willin', sir, to help make you a crap,” replied
the slave, “but when you gits such a mean oversee',
whar whips all de time, I can't stand it.”</p>
          <p>“Burton,” said the master, “you take your satisfaction
out of him, and then give him an extra fifty for
me, to make him tell who fed him when he was
out.”</p>
          <p>With a grim smile upon his repulsive face, the overseer
led Lewis to the smoke-house, and put him in the
stocks; then, leaving him there to meditate upon the
manifold benefits ensuing to his poor heathen race
from being allowed to dwell in a Christian country, he
went out to see that all his other subjects had commenced
their daily toil in accordance with the orders
he had given them.</p>
          <p>After dinner, he went in to chastise his victim. He,
fastened his wrists in their appropriate mortise, and
then, lighting his pipe, sat down to his delightful
task.</p>
          <p>Burton was in his element. He wasted not his
strength by violent exercise or undue excitement, for
his long arms swayed leisurely in unison with his
pleasant thoughts. He had plenty of time to “take his
satisfaction,” and at every cut of the cowhide that
<pb id="pickard194" n="194"/>
forced an extraordinary groan from the prostrate
wretch before him, a gleam of fiendish exultation
flitted across his savage face; and through his closed
teeth he hissed: “Ah! that's a good one; it takes me
to break a nigger in.”</p>
          <p>When he had given him enough for once, he called
two of the boys, and ordered them to make “a bucket
of strong pickle.” and carry it to his house. “My
wife,” said he, “will put in some spirits of turpentine,
and then it will do to rub down this gentleman.”</p>
          <p>They soon brought the brine, prepared according to
his directions, and then, by his command, they
washed poor Lewis from head to foot. Oh! how he
shrieked and writhed as the stinging fluid penetrated
every bleeding gash the cruel whip had made! Then,
after giving him a few more cuts, as he said, “to beat
the medicine in,” Burton loosened his wrists, and,
leaving his feet still in the stocks, went out and locked
the door.</p>
          <p>For four clays, the slave remained fast in the stocks;
his loneliness unbroken, save by a daily visit from the
overseer, who came in “just to give him a few cuts to
wake him up.” By this time his wounds were much
inflamed, and he begged to be allowed to go to his
cabin and put on clean clothes.</p>
          <p>Burton granted this request; but placed him in
charge of two other slaves, who were informed that if
they did not bring him back when he had changed his
clothes, they should take “the same bounty.”</p>
          <p>They led him to his cabin, and his wife called in
several of the other women to see his back. Vina
was one of these. She says: “When I went in the
door, Lucy was a wettin' his shirt with warm water to
<pb id="pickard195" n="195"/>
loosen it from his back; and his two children, Charles
and 'Muthis, was a cryin' like their hearts was done
broke. Lucy soak the shirt a long time, till she think
it done got loose; but a heap o' times, when she tried
to pull it up, it fetch up welts o' flesh about the size o'
my finger 'long with it. Then the blood <hi rend="italics">trinkle</hi> down
his back, and 'peared like, he'd faint, constant. She
wash his back till it done stop bleedin', and then she
kivered it all over with tallered plasters. Then, when
he got his clean clothes on, the men whar fotch him
from the smoke-house, they carried him back. Lucy
and her children stood in the door, and watched him
till he done got out o' sight; and 'peard like, they all
would sob theirselves to death.”</p>
          <p>This was Sunday. Early the next morning Lewis
was taken out of his prison, and led by two men to
the blacksmith's shop, to receive “the runaway's
irons.” An iron ring weighing fourteen pounds, was
welded on his ankle; and to that was fastened one end
of a heavy log-chain, the other end of which was
brought up and passed twice around his waist, where
it was secured by a lock. A collar was then put
around his neck, from which an iron horn extended
on each side nearly to the point of the shoulder.</p>
          <p>He was then sent to the field, and forced to work,
though he could hardly drag himself along. Through
all the long hot summer days those heavy irons galled
his neck and ankle, and even on the Sabbath he had
no rest. “Sometimes,” says Vina, “ 'peared like he
would run crazy. But he never got no pity from
them whar was the cause of all the trouble. They
only laughed at his misery, makin' out like thar's
nuthin' bad enough for runaways.”</p>
          <pb id="pickard196" n="196"/>
          <p>One wet morning in the summer, Burton told
Abram, a blacksmith, who was then headman of the
hoe hands, to go to one of the bills to scrape cotton, as
the bottom was too wet. Abram accordingly led his
hands to the hill which he supposed Burton meant,
and they all fell earnestly at work. Soon they saw
the overseer coming with his grey horse at full gallop.
“Why in h—l didn't you go where I told you?”
shouted he to Abram.</p>
          <p>“I thought this yer de place, Sir.”</p>
          <p>“You thought! You're not to think; you're to
do.”</p>
          <p>Abram attempted to explain, but Burton grew furious;
and at last he drew forth his pistol and shot the
slave through the leg—thus crippling him for many
months.</p>
          <p>The master “<hi rend="italics">cursed and blustered a heap</hi>” about this,
but he was so sure that such a <hi rend="italics">tight fellow</hi> must be a
first rate overseer, that he could not think of turning
him away.</p>
          <p>Yet even he at length grew weary of the sight of
his ragged, filthy people. “I say, Burton,” said he
one day, as he rode through the field, “how the devil
can you work such a miserable gang of niggers?
Why don't you make them wash and mend their
clothes?</p>
          <p>“D—n 'em; I don't care how they look;” replied
the overseer. “If they only work, I don't care if the
lice eat 'em alive.”</p>
          <p>“Well, I do; and by G—d, they look too bad. I
say, if they don't wash and mend their clothes, you
give them the devil.”</p>
          <p>Vina stood near and listened with indignation to
<pb id="pickard197" n="197"/>
this order. “When we gwine wash?” cried she.
“We got to work every day, Sundays and all; we
ain't got no time to wash nor mend.”</p>
          <p>“What are you all doing nights, d—n you ?”</p>
          <p>“We's a workin' for you, sir, all the time, day and
night; and drove and whipped till we's half dead, any
how.”</p>
          <p>He turned away. “Burton,” said he, “you might
as well give the women<hi rend="italics"> two hours by sun</hi> of a Saturday
to wash, for by G—d, they're too d—d filthy.”</p>
          <p>The next Saturday, just as the sun was going behind
the trees, Burton dismissed the women to go home and
wash. But they would not please him by accepting
that for “two hours by sun,” and so on Monday morning
they went out in the same tattered frocks—the
rags sailing in the wind. They had every week washed
their under garments by night—but this they kept a
secret. They were determined to look as badly as they
could, until their master should give them at least their
Sundays to work for themselves.</p>
          <p>The effect of Burton's constant whipping and crippling
the hands was manifest in the fields. So many
of the people were driven to the woods, or otherwise
unfitted for their usual labors, that the corn was
choked, and the cotton could scarcely be seen amid the
tall, rank grass.</p>
          <p>This unpromising state of his darling crop at length
opened the master's eyes. He rode through the field one
day when Burton was not there. “What the devil ails
you all?” said he; “I never was in the grass like this.”</p>
          <p>“No wonder,” replied one of the boldest men,
“reckon you'll never git out de grass long's you keeps
ole Burton yer. He knows nuthin 'bout farmin,' no
<pb id="pickard198" n="198"/>
how he des beats your people, and cuts 'em up constant;
dat dar's all he know. Dem whars able to
work at all can't do past half a day's work, kase dey's
all so bruised and cut up.”</p>
          <p>“ 'Pears like,” says Vina, “this teched his heart. ”He's
mons's 'shamed o' bein' in the grass so much wuss 'an
all his neighbors,”</p>
          <p>Soon after the angry old man cursed the overseer,
and ordered him off the place, and though Burton
swore he would not go till he was ready, yet after a
few weeks he departed.</p>
          <p>For the discharge of this inhuman monster the
master received no thanks. His servants knew he
cared not for their sufferings, but only for the grass
which waved so boldly in his fields of corn and cotton.
To use the words of Vina, “when it come to that, they
didn't try to git him out o' the grass. He done kep'
that mean ole Burton thar all the forepart of the year,
and let him cut 'em up 'cordin' to his own mercy, and
now they wasn't gwine try to make a crap. So that
year we didn't make corn enough to last till June. We
had to go half fed, and the mules got so poor they'd
fall down in the plough. They didn't git nuthin' but
fodder, for it come. mons's hard to have to buy corn.”</p>
          <p>The next overseer was the reverse of Burton. “The
people all liked him mightily, and he made an elegant
crap without any fuss.” The stocks were empty, the
runaway's irons laid by to rust, and the cowhide was
almost wholly idle. But this did not suit the master:
and before the year closed he was discharged. Mr.
McKiernan declared that his niggers were “all free, and
going about kicking up their heels;” he must get somebody
that would be “<hi rend="italics">tight.</hi>” “<hi rend="italics">Niggers must be kept down.</hi>”</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
          <head>FIRST FOUR YEARS IN TUSCUMBIA.</head>
          <p>AT the beginning of the year 1842, Peter was hired
to Mr. James A. Stoddard, at that time teacher of the
boys school in Tuscumbia. He was a New England
man, an elder in the Presbyterian church, and an exception
to the often-quoted rule, that “persons who
have been <hi rend="itlaics">raised</hi> in the free States make tile worst
masters.”</p>
          <p>The peaceful home of Mr. Stoddard, with the light
labor which devolved upon him, formed a pleasant contrast
to the plantation where he had spent the preceding
year. He was now well-fed; and was furnished
during the year with four suits of clothes, which was
one more than he had been accustomed to receive.
These suits consisted each of a coarse cotton shirt, with
roundabouts and trousers of blue jean. They were
not rich, nor costly, it is true, but they were always
clean.</p>
          <p>During this year, he went regularly once in two
weeks to see his family, and on these occasions he was
often able to carry them some little comforts. These
he earned by performing little services for others at
times when Mr. Stoddard had nothing for him to do.
Sometimes he went on foot to the plantation, twelve
miles distant, but often some kind gentleman lent him
<pb id="pickard200" n="200"/>
a horse; and then with the little package of coffee and
sugar, or perhaps with a comfortable jacket for one of
his beloved sons, he rode along with a hopeful heart.</p>
          <p>Eagerly did his three boys, with their little sister,
watch for their father's coming; and when they heard
his approaching footsteps, although the night was dark,
they bounded forth to meet him with shouts of joy.
Ah! they knew he brought the sunshine in his heart.</p>
          <p>In October of this year, Miss Sarah Gist, the second
daughter of his deceased master, was married to young
John H. Hogun, a son of her mother's husband. The
eldest daughter, Mary, had died about two years after
the second marriage of her mother.</p>
          <p>A division of the property was now made. The
slaves numbered thirty-four, but to one old man,
Uncle Pompey, the guardians of the estate granted his
liberty. The remaining thirty-three were examined
and appraised by a committee of five men; and then,
after being divided into three lots, they were drawn by
the agents of the three heirs.</p>
          <p>The lot in which Peter was placed was drawn by
Miss Sarah's agent; and the guardianship of his affairs
was consequently transferred to her father-in-law. He
took charge of the property of his children until they
should become of age, the young bridegroom at his
marriage being but eighteen years old, while the bride
was only sixteen.</p>
          <p>Uncle Pompey, who was kindly set free on this
occasion was about eighty years old. His wife was
the property of Rev. Mr. L. of Leighton. The poor
old man was not wanted there, and for some time he
wandered to and fro, a prey to the cruelty of patrols
and other ruffians who abounded in that region. By
<pb id="pickard201" n="201"/>
these he was persecuted and beaten till Miss Sarah,
pitying his sufferings, took him home and cared for
him during the remainder of his life.</p>
          <p>Great was the consternation among the slaves that
were drawn by Miss Sarah and her young husband,
when they learned that the elder Hogun was, at least
for a time, to be their master. They knew his character,
and feared that he might take them home to work
on the plantation. He, however, allowed them to
remain where they were during the year, and at
Christmas time, he hired them out again.</p>
          <p>Mr. Stoddard was, throughout the year, a kind friend
to Peter; and at its close, he recommended him so
warmly to his pastor, the Rev. Mr. Stedman, that he
hired him for the ensuing year of Mr. Hogun. Mr.
Stoddard soon after quitted teaching, and re-opened
his store in Tuscumbia, where he still remains—a
highly respected merchant, and one of the best citizens
in town.</p>
          <p>To Mr. and Mrs. Stedman, Peter soon became ardently
attached. In all their dealings with him they
respected his humanity; and no effort on their part
was spared that could promote his happiness.</p>
          <p>His duties were various, and required all his time;
but he performed them cheerfully, for his heart was in
his work. He took the whole care of the Church—
kept it clean, rang the bell, and built fires when they
were needed. Then he hauled all the wood for the
family, and prepared it for the fire; “hauled water”
from the spring for two families besides his own; and
performed also the duties of waiter and errand boy.
If the cook chanced to be sick a day or two, he took
her place, and filled it with ability—in short, he
<pb id="pickard202" n="202"/>
spared no effort that could conduce to the comfort of
those who showed by their steady kindness, that they
regarded him as <hi rend="italics">a man.</hi></p>
          <p>Morning and evening when they knelt at the family
altar, the servants were called in, and as the man of
God poured forth his petitions to the Great Father, the
heart of the lowly slave was lifted upward, and from
the loving household band a pure offering of thanksgiving
ascended to the throne of the Invisible.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Stedman was a native of New England and
from her conversation and manners, Peter received his
first impressions of life in “<hi rend="italics">the</hi> North.” Oh! how
ardently he wished that he might one day behold that
wondrous land where all are free!</p>
          <p>The Christmas Holidays arrived, but Peter instead
of going, as was the usual custom, to spend them with
his fellow-servants at his mistress' home, remained in
town with his good friend, Mrs. Stedman. She had
need of his services until the end of the year, and
though his time for that week was his own, he had no
wish to leave her.</p>
          <p>His failure to come out with his fellow-servants, Mr.
Hogun construed into a sign of increasing independence
of his master's family. Such an offence must
needs be punished. He therefore hired him for the
next year to Mr. John Pollock, a merchant of Tuscumbia.
He knew this would be distasteful to Peter,
because he would naturally choose to remain in the
service of the kind Pastor; but when the slave ventured
to express this preference, he received only
curses, and an assurance that he “asked no odds of a
nigger.” “You've got mighty independent all at
once;” said he, “couldn't come out Christmas to tell
<pb id="pickard203" n="203"/>
me where you wanted to live; so now you shall go
where I say, d—n you.”</p>
          <p>On New Years Day, 1844, Peter went to Mr. Pollock's.
Here, too, he was kindly treated, and his labor
was not severe. He filled vacancies among the house
servants, worked in the garden, and was drayman for
the store, where he slept whenever the clerk chanced
to be absent. He was diligent and faithful; and his
employer ever after spoke in his praise.</p>
          <p>In August of this year, Mr. Pollock, at Peter's request,
hired him out to go as cook with a company of
gentlemen to the Whig Mass Convention at Nashville.</p>
          <p>The party numbered sixty-three; and they were
well supplied with tents, provisions, and various conveniences
for camping out on the road. They had
quantities of bread and bacon, with a store of meal for
the indispensable hot corn cake.</p>
          <p>At about nine o'clock on the morning of the fifteenth
day of August, the procession passed gaily through
the town. At the doors and windows, bright eyes
were beaming, and fair hands waved hopeful adieus to
husbands, sons, and lovers; and though the day was
intensely hot, the merry band responded in high
spirits.</p>
          <p>Many of the gentlemen rode their own horses, while
others went in the wagons; and conversation, mirth,
and song, enlivened all the hours. They stopped occasionally
to rest their horses, and to enjoy for a little
while the delicious shade at the bright springs which
sparkle here and there in the pleasant Valley of the
Tennessee.</p>
          <p>Just before sunset, they reached Blue Water, a quiet
<pb id="pickard204" n="204"/>
little stream, that flows between banks of softest green
into the lovely river. Here they encamped for the
night. The gentlemen proceeded to put up the tents,
while the servants built a fire, and prepared the supper.
The cooking devolved on Peter, and a man belonging
to Mr. W—, of Florence; and while they
vied with each other in displaying their knowledge of
the elegancies of their art, the two remaining servants
were sent to the neighboring Whig farmers to bring
straw for the floors of the tents.</p>
          <p>Forked sticks were then driven into the ground to
support two or three long planks which had been
brought in one of the wagons. These formed their
table, on which were set the bread and bacon, and the
hot coffee which had been prepared in a great kettle
over the fire.</p>
          <p>Each of the party was supplied with a little tin plate,
which he filled himself, and with this he seated himself
on a stump or on the soft green turf. Here he
enjoyed his simple supper with a relish unknown to
those who pine for appetite beside the heavy-laden
board of luxury.</p>
          <p>After supper, wine, cards and merry conversation
filled the hours, till as sleep began to steal over their
senses, they sought their tents, where on the clean
straw were spread their mattresses and blankets, inviting
them to gentle slumbers.</p>
          <p>The early morning found them all astir. Hot coffee
steamed on the rude table, and a hearty breakfast was
soon dispatched. Then the tents were struck, and,
with the blankets and cooking utensils, the slaves replaced
them in the wagons. The horses, which after
being well fed, had been hitched to the trees at night,
<pb id="pickard205" n="205"/>
were soon prepared for motion, and, with a loud
“Hurrah!” the party commenced their second day's
journey.</p>
          <p>At every town through which they passed, they
were greeted with welcoming shouts. Ladies waved
their hands as they passed by, and little children raised
their tiny flags, and cried, “Hurrah for Clay!”</p>
          <p>They reached Nashville on the eighteenth, at noon.
The Convention was already in session; and the white
tents of other visitors dotted the green fields and
groves in the suburbs, while in the wood southeast of
the city, were set long tables for the entertainment of
the guests from abroad. These tables were abundantly
furnished by the Whigs of the city with substantial
viands, suited to the taste of all. Bands of music enlivened
the groves, and it seemed a universal gala day.</p>
          <p>Stands for speakers were erected at various places in
the city; and wordy politicians talked themselves
hoarse on the beauties of high tariffs, and the disastrous
consequences that would follow the election of Mr.
Polk. Banners with full-length portraits of the great
Kentucky statesman were borne in front of processions
through the streets—though Mr. Clay himself sat in
his quiet home.</p>
          <p>The Tuscumbia delegation pitched their tents on a
hill near the city, and at once entered heartily into the
excitement. Their four servants also, keenly enjoyed
these lively times, which formed a variation in their
monotonous existence; and to this day the stirring
scenes and noisy crowds of the great Convention form
the basis of many a tale, which beguiles the dreary
hours of toil.</p>
          <p>They spent a week in the city; though the Convention
<pb id="pickard206" n="206"/>
adjourned three days after their arrival. The remaining
time was spent by the gentlemen in visiting
friends, or in such other amusements as were suited to
their various tastes and habits.</p>
          <p>Peter had hoped that, during his stay at Nashville,
he might find some chance to escape from slavery;
and it was with this purpose in his heart, that he asked
leave to go. He had brought with him his little stock
of money—only fifteen dollars, it is true, but it seemed
to him a large sum, and he was sure it would do him
“a heap of good” if he were free. Thoughts of leaving
his dear wife and children made him very sad;
but the idea of freedom was mighty; and he resolved
to try.</p>
          <p>He walked in the evening down to the river, but on
no boat could he espy a corner where he might hide
and sail away to the far land of the free. He could
not be long absent from the camp without being missed
by some of his many masters; and when the week had
passed away, and the company were about to return,
he had been able to discover no avenue of escape. So
he aided in the preparations for the homeward journey;
and smothered in his heart those wild longings for
liberty that had so long been struggling there for
breath.</p>
          <p>The gentlemen all noticed with approval his active
industry, and enjoyed the comforts which they owed
to his quick perceptions of order and fitness in the arrangement
of their few conveniences; yet not one of
them guessed what a brave, true heart he bore; or
how that heart, like a caged bird, was even then beating
and struggling to be free. Their return home was
gayer even than their outward journey. Jests and
<pb id="pickard207" n="207"/>
merriment abounded. Amusing experiences during
their sojourn in the city were reviewed; and none
noticed or cared that the servant was less happy than
his masters.</p>
          <p>Arrived once more at home, Peter moved on in the
old channels. His failure to escape from thraldom
had not caused him to despair; and as each day he
fulfilled his round of duties, the hope was strong within
him that a brighter morn would yet appear.</p>
          <p>On the first day of 1845, Peter entered the service
of Mr. Michael Brady, a wealthy Irishman, also a merchant
of Tuscumbia. He was a young bachelor of
pleasing manners and strict business habits.</p>
          <p>Peter had now better opportunities than he had
ever before enjoyed for gaining general information.
He was employed about the store, in waiting on his
young master, and doing errands; and he was frequently
an interested listener to conversations which
they did not dream he had the sense to understand.
He had also many opportunities of becoming acquainted
with the citizens of the town, and his habits
of close observation tended to his rapid advancement
in a knowledge of human nature. Even at this time
few more correct judges of character could be found in
town than this quiet, docile slave. He seemed to see
beneath the surface, and to glance deep at the motives
of the heart.</p>
          <p>Mr. Brady, although extremely kind to Peter, had
some peculiar notions. He paid for his board at a
hotel, instead of letting him earn it by waiting on the
table, as was the custom with young men who hired a
slave; and he positively forbade Peter's performing
<pb id="pickard208" n="208"/>
the slightest service for any person except his partner
and himself. In this prohibition Peter felt the galling
chains of slavery. He loved to do a kindness; and it
was so natural to bring a bucket of water, or to black
a pair of boots for some young gentleman who addressed
him kindly, that he could scarcely avoid
offering such little services, though he knew that thus
he should incur the displeasure of his young master.</p>
          <p>But Mr. Brady was firm. He did not intend that
his servant should need favors from others. He preferred
supplying his wants himself: and often, when
Peter was going on Saturday night to make his accustomed
visit to his family, the young man gave him
some little present for them from the store.</p>
          <p>For all these kindnesses Peter was duly grateful, but
they did not sweeten the slave-cup. It still overflowed
with bitterness; and in his heart he spurned the draught,
and vowed he would be free.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="chapter">
          <pb id="pickard209" n="209"/>
          <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
          <head>PETER HIRES HIS TIME.</head>
          <p>The next year, 1846, the young master, John H.
Hogun, having become of age, assumed the control of
his wife's property, and hired Peter to Mr. Allen Pollock,
a bookseller of Tuscumbia.</p>
          <p>Mr. Pollock had, some weeks before Christmas, proposed
to Peter that he should live with him the ensuing
year, and hire his own time. He had not much
for him to do, he said, and after cutting his wood,
putting his store in order, blacking his boots, and
doing such other small jobs as might be necessary, he
could get work elsewhere in town; and all he earned
above the eighty-five dollars hire which Hogun must
receive, should be his own. True, this arrangement
was against the law, but if it were kept secret, it could
do no harm.</p>
          <p>For a long time Peter hesitated. Mr. Pollock was
said to be a close, penurious man, and our student of
human nature doubted the disinterestedness of his
motives. Still there was a <hi rend="italics">chance</hi> that he might succeed
in saving something; he might, at least, procure
more comforts for his family than they had yet possessed
and he at length resolved to try.</p>
          <pb id="pickard210" n="210"/>
          <p>So the bargain was concluded; openly with Mr.
Hogun, privately between Mr. Pollock and the slave;
and Peter entered, trembling, upon the now year. He
had never before occupied so respectable a position.
The eighty-five dollars must be earned, and that was a
great sum to be raised by dimes and half dimes, for
doing little jobs about town.</p>
          <p>At a short distance from the store was Major Pope's
hotel, where he engaged his board, for which he was to
pay by waiting on the table. He then looked about for
work; and was recommended by some friend to the
teachers of the Ladies' School, as a neat and careful
man, who would be capable of keeping the rooms in
order, and of performing any other labor that might be
required about the building. He was immediately
engaged for this service, which occupied him two or
three hours each day.</p>
          <p>He also, now and then, found whitewashing to do;
and when extra servants were wanted on occasion of a
wedding or a party, he found profitable employment.
If a cook was sick, he was competent to take her place;
and when some weary child of earth had finished his
short pilgrimage, Peter was called upon to hollow his
lowly grave.</p>
          <p>He was at the same time hired by the month to take
care of several stores—to sweep, black boots, take up
ashes, and bring water; and thus he became well known
to most of the business men in town.</p>
          <p>The young gentlemen frequently gave parties at the
Franklin House, then the principal hotel in town.
They furnished the refreshments and table furniture,
merely occupying the rooms of the hotel for which
they paid a reasonable sum. On these occasions, Peter
<pb id="pickard211" n="211"/>
was invaluable. He prepared the rooms and arranged
the tables, and the pleasures of the evening were never
marred by neglect or carelessness in his department.
Then he had a quiet way of keeping things in place,
and of seeing that the guests were supplied with all
conveniences throughout the evening; and after the
gay company had dispersed, he returned all borrowed
articles, and re-arranged the furniture of the rooms in
its accustomed order.</p>
          <p>His ready kindness, and his promptness in executing
his employers' wishes, won him the confidence and
esteem of all he served; still, these numerous cares and
diverse occupations were extremely fatiguing. All the
day long, and often till late at night he was in active
exercise of mind and body, yet though his limbs grew
weary, his energies of spirit never drooped.</p>
          <p>Thus passed the year away. Every week or two he
paid his hire to Mr. Pollock, who several times proposed
to act as his treasurer. These offers Peter declined,
excusing himself by saying that he spent the
most of his money to buy things for his wife and children,
and so he had not much to keep.</p>
          <p>“I don't see, then,” said the gentleman, “any use in
your hiring your time, if you spend all your money.”</p>
          <p>“Oh! that's what I work for,” replied the slave, “to
buy comforts for my family.”</p>
          <p>At the end of the year he had saved seventy-five
dollars, besides having spent thirty-five dollars, during
the year, on his wife and children. But this was a
profound secret to all but Vina. No one in Tuscumbia
knew even that he hired his time. It was understood,
by those for whom he labored, that Mr. Pollock permitted
<pb id="pickard212" n="212"/>
him to make his own bargains, and that to him he paid in all he
earned.</p>
          <p>His success this year was an astonishment to himself. It
opened a new world before him. Hitherto, his only hope of
escape from slavery had been in flight; but now came other
thoughts. “Seventy-five dollars in one year! How long would it
take to buy myself if I could get the same chance every year?
Oh! if I could be free!”</p>
          <p>Towards the close of the year. Mr. Pollock proposed to his
master to hire Peter again; but Mr. Hogan declined making a
second bargain with him until he had consulted Peter.</p>
          <p>“Well, boy,” said he, a few days before Christmas, “do you
want to live with Mr. Pollock again next year?”</p>
          <p>“No, Sir,” replied Peter, “I don't keer 'bout livin' with him.”</p>
          <p>“Why, I reckon he's used you well this year, and he offers to
pay me up now for your hire. I reckon you'll do as well with him
as any where. It's not often that a man offers to pay money
before it is due.”</p>
          <p>“Well, Sir, if you hire me to Mr. Pollock, I shall have to stay
with him; but there's Mr. Joseph Friedman—he'll pay you as well
as Mr. Pollock, and he'd like to hire me for next year.”</p>
          <p>The young master immediately called on Mr. Friedman, and
learning that what Peter had told him was correct, he hired him
to the Jew before he left the store.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">The Jew</hi>! Yes; Joseph Friedman was a German Jew, who
had resided in Tuscumbia for six or seven
<pb id="pickard213" n="213"/>
years. He came there at first with a small stock of
goods and opened a store, and by untiring industry
and strict economy he had now accumulated a handsome little
fortune.</p>
          <p>He was small in stature, with the black hair and keen dark
eyes peculiar to his race. Associated with him in business was
his younger brother, Isaac, who was taller and handsomer than
Joseph, but scarcely his equal in sagacity and force of character.</p>
          <p>At the commencement of their sojourn in Tuscumbia, these
Jews, the first that had ever settled in that region, were regarded
with suspicion and dislike. But as their stern integrity and manly
independence of character became known to the citizens, the
prejudice excited by their peculiarities of religion and manners
gradually subsided. As business men, they gained the
confidence of the public, and though they never mingled freely in
society, they were no longer exposed to rudeness or neglect.</p>
          <p>Peter during the past year, had been mysteriously attracted
towards these somewhat isolated brothers. His thoughts had
been intensely occupied in devising some method by which he
might yet taste that liberty, which, notwithstanding he had been
forty years a slave, he still felt was his <hi rend="italics">right</hi>. Day and night he
had pondered this subject; but one great difficulty was ever
present to his mind. He knew not <hi rend="italics">a man</hi> whom he could trust. If
he dared to breathe, in human ear, his wish for freedom, the
bold thought might be reported to his master, and from that
moment he would be looked upon as unsafe property. The
consequence of this <hi rend="italics">might be</hi> a sale, and a journey to the low
country; and then the light of hope would be forever
quenched.</p>
          <pb id="pickard214" n="214"/>
          <p>And even if his master should be willing to sell him to himself,
what security could he have that he would not deceive him, and
while he took his hard-earned ransom, retain <hi rend="italics">him</hi> also in his iron
grasp? His long acquaintance with slavery in every guise had
made him wary. He remembered Spencer Williams of
Lexington, who three times paid the price of his own
redemption, and was at last sent to the hated South in chains.
No wonder that Peter trembled at the thought of such a blighting
of his budding hopes. No wonder that he weighed each word
that fell upon his ear, in order to discern the spirit of the
speaker. Oh! that he knew a man of soul so brave that he could
safely confide to him his heart's great secret! There might be
many such in town; but how could he distinguish them from
those whose flattering words proceeded from the deep, dark
caverns of deceitful hearts?</p>
          <p>While his ear was thus eagerly bent to catch the breath of
honesty, some chance remarks of Mr. Friedman drew his
attention. The Jew made no display of his opinions, or
declaration of his principles; but uttered merely some careless
sentence, which revealed his sympathy with the suffering, and his
hatred of injustice and oppression. Peter had often performed
slight services for the two brothers, and whenever he was in
their presence, although no word respecting himself was uttered,
he felt that he was regarded as <hi rend="italics">a man.</hi></p>
          <p>It was this feeling which induced him, before his year expired
at Mr. Pollock's, to ask Mr. Friedman to hire him for the
ensuing year. If he could persuade him to do this, he could have
an opportunity to become more thoroughly acquainted with his
character;
<pb id="pickard215" n="215"/>
and perhaps—oh! how the bare idea thrilled his
frame!—perhaps he should thus discover the path to
liberty.</p>
          <p>To Peter's request the Jew readily assented, and, as before
related, the bargain with his master was concluded.</p>
          <p>On the first day of January, 1847, Peter commenced his
labors under the protection of Mr. Friedman. According to their
private contract, he was to board and clothe himself; and then,
whatever he earned above his hire should be his own. He waited
on the table at a hotel, as during the previous year, to pay his
board; and his clothing cost him very little—as the Friedman
brothers gave him all their cast-off clothes, as well as
occasionally the material for a new garment from the store.
Besides these, he frequently, received presents of half-worn
clothing from other young men whom he was always glad to
serve; or from married ladies, of discarded articles from the
wardrobe of their husbands.</p>
          <p>These clothes, however, he never wore, but sold them to
slaves from the surrounding plantations—receiving in payment,
eggs, chickens, or any little products of their patches, which they
brought into town for sale. These articles he conveyed to the
hotel, where they were always in demand, and so were
speedily, converted into money. He always appeared in the
same attire—blue roundabout and trowsers, with strong
shoes; and a more respectable looking servant could not be
seen in all the town.</p>
          <p>At the opening of this year, Mr. A. E. Sloan, formerly of
Syracuse, N. Y., who had purchased the interest in the school
of the former Principal, established the Tuscumbia Female
Seminary. Mr. Sloan was a
<pb id="pickard216" n="216"/>
gentleman of agreeable personal appearance, scrupulously neat
in his dress and surroundings, and orderly to fastidiousness. He
determined at once to establish in the school a new system of
order and discipline; and soon made, inquiries for a person
competent to carry out his plans in the arrangement of the
school-rooms. Peter was the first one named to him, and he
immediately secured his services. This measure he afterwards
found no reason to regret, for so quiet was he, and yet so
prompt and regular in the performance of his duties, that soon his
presence, for a few hours each morning, seemed indispensable to
the comfort of the school. A few weeks later, Mr. G. H. King, of
Northampton, Mass., came on to teach music. He, too, soon
learned Peter's excellent traits of character, and gave him
employment whenever he had pianos to move, or any work to
be done which required carefulness and promptitude.</p>
          <p>He was now employed about the school-rooms a much
greater proportion of his time than he had been during the
preceding year. His grateful love for Mrs. Stedman had
predisposed him in favor of Northern ladies; and as at the
Seminary he ever received kind looks and pleasant words, he
soon became warmly attached to all the teachers. Yet he never
confided to one of them his secret. They regarded him as an
embodiment of good humor and content; never imagining
that the idea of freedom had been struggling in
his breast for years. Once or twice, he says, he was on
the point of opening his heart to one of the young
ladies, but when he tried to speak the great hope that was
swelling in his breast, something seemed to choke him and he
could not utter it. He took an opportunity
<pb id="pickard217" n="217"/>
however, to sound Messrs. Sloan and King on the
subject of slavery; and they represented the condition of the
slaves as so far above that of the free blacks at the North, that
he judged it would be idle to look to them for sympathy in his
one engrossing hope.</p>
          <p>“Why, Peter,” said Mr. King, “negroes in the North do not
fare half as well as you, and they are not so well thought of. Few
people will employ them or trust them they are shunned and
disliked. To tell the truth, most of them deserve no better
treatment; for they are an idle, worthless set of fellows.”</p>
          <p>All this did not discourage Peter. A voice within him
whispered, “Toil on! Heed not such words as these! Liberty is
before you; and you have drunk too deep in slavery to believe
that freedom would render you less happy, or less worthy of
esteem.”</p>
          <p>The confidence between the worthy Jew and his faithful
servant was constantly on the increase; yet, as the year drew
near its close, and Mr. Friedman made no advances towards
hiring him for the next, Peter became uneasy. Several other
persons had proposed hiring him, but he had told them all that
he thought Mr. Friedman wished to keep him another year.</p>
          <p>At length, when Christmas was very near, he one day saw his
young master across the street, and he resolved to terminate
his suspense. So he approached the Jew. “Look yer, sir,”
said he, “ain't you willin' to do the same by me next year that
you have done?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Peter.”</p>
          <p>“Well, are you satisfied with the way I have done this
year?”</p>
          <p>“Yes;—are <hi rend="italics">you</hi> satisfied?”</p>
          <pb id="pickard218" n="218"/>
          <p>“Yes, sir, to be sure I am: and if you're willin' to do
agin like you've done this year, why don't you go and hire
me? Thar's my master, over yon.”</p>
          <p>“I see him there, but I will not run to speak to him.”</p>
          <p>“Well, sir,” exclaimed the delighted slave, “I'll tell
him you want to hire me; and we shan't have no new
bargain to make; if you'll do like you have done, so will I.”</p>
          <p>The conference ended, and soon Peter was hired for
another year to Joseph Friedman.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
          <head>PETER BUYS HIMSELF.</head>
          <p>PETER commenced the year 1848 with high hopes.
His last year's gains had greatly encouraged him, for he
had laid up, besides expending over thirty dollars for his
family, one hundred and five dollars; which, with thirty
dollars which he had saved before he hired his time, and
the seventy-five that he had accumulated while with Mr.
Pollock, made two hundred and ten dollars now in his
possession.</p>
          <p>The hope of being free he had thus far communicated
to none but his true-hearted wife; but now, as he had
become satisfied that Mr. Friedman was his friend, he
determined to seek his co-operation in his plan. This
resolution was not formed without the most careful
consideration; and yet, when he approached the counting-room
for the purpose of opening to the Jew his cherished
plans, his heart throbbed painfully, and his knees
trembled so that he could scarcely walk.</p>
          <p>“Mr. Friedman,” said he, “I've got something I want to
tell you, but it 's a great secret.”</p>
          <p>“Well, Peter—”</p>
          <p>“I've been a thinkin', sir, I'd like to buy myself and
you've always dealt so fa'r with me, I didn't know but you
mought buy me, and then give me a chance.”</p>
          <pb id="pickard220" n="220"/>
          <p>The Jew's countenance brightened. He had become
much attached to Peter, and had often wished in his heart
that by some means the faithful fellow might be free, but
such a plan as this had not occurred to him.</p>
          <p>“Can you get the money, Peter?”</p>
          <p>“I reckon I could, if you didn't pay too high for me.
Mars<corr sic=",">'</corr>John Henry oughtn't to ask a great price
for me, no how, when I've served the family so long.”</p>
          <p>“How much shall I give for you?”</p>
          <p>“I think, sir, five hundred dollars is as much as you
ought to pay.”</p>
          <p>“Hogan will not sell you for that price,” said the Jew.
“John Pollock offered him six hundred, and he laughed at
him. Some men in town would give eight hundred dollars
for you—not because you are worth so much, but because
they know you.”</p>
          <p>“Well, sir, I have served the family for thirty-five
years. I have earned 'em a heap of money, and have been
mighty little trouble or expense. They can afford to sell
me for five hundred dollars.”</p>
          <p>“Yes:—well, I will speak to Hogan.”</p>
          <p>The proposition of the Jew received, at first, but little
favor. Peter was an old family servant, and they
intended to keep him in the family as long as he lived.
They did not wish to sell him.</p>
          <p>“Well,” said Friedman, “I would like to buy him. He has
a cough, and if he belonged to me, I would try to cure it,
but while he is your property, I can do nothing for him. I
will give you five hundred dollars.”</p>
          <p>Hogun turned away. He did not want to sell the
<pb id="pickard221" n="221"/>
boy; if he did, that was no price for him. He would bring
twice that sum.</p>
          <p>A few months after this conversation, Joseph Friedman
went to the “Red River Country,” where he opened a store;
leaving his brother Isaac in charge at Tuscumbia. This
made no change in Peter's condition. He toiled on as
before, steadily adding to big precious gains, while the
great hope of freedom grew stronger in his heart.</p>
          <p>Soon after his brother left town, Isaac renewed to Mr.
Hogun the proposition to purchase Peter, but
with no more success. The young mistress did not want
him sold; especially to a <hi rend="italics">Jew</hi>, who had no higher wish
than to make money. He would probably soon sell him
again: for what use had he for a servant?—and then,
perhaps, the poor old fellow would be
carried away to the “low country.”</p>
          <p>After several attempts to purchase him had been
unsuccessful, Peter determined to try the power of his
own eloquence. Accordingly, during the last week of the
year, he went out to the plantation.</p>
          <p>His young mistress had gone with her husband to town;
but they soon returned. Peter met them at the gate, and
“Miss Sarah,” after shaking hands with him, went in; while
the young master remained in the yard to inquire after his
health. His cough was particularly troublesome whenever
any of his master's family were near, and now it annoyed
him exceedingly. “Ugh! ugh! Mass'r John Henry, I come
to see you 'bout Mr. Friedman buyin' me. I like to live
with him; and he said he done named it to you.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, he did; but he didn't offer any price for you—
only five hundred dollars.”</p>
          <pb id="pickard222" n="222"/>
          <p>“Well, Mass'r John Henry, aint that thar enough
for me?”</p>
          <p>“No—I can get a thousand dollars for you any
day.”</p>
          <p>“Ugh! ugh! I think you mighty hard to ask such
a big price for me, when I been in your service so long.
Miss Sarah done got all my arnins ever since I belonged
to her great. uncle, Mars Nattie Gist. Now
when I'm a'most fifty years old, ugh! ugh! ugh I
think five hundred dollars is enough for me; and
'pears like, sir, you oughtent to ask no more.”</p>
          <p>“Well, Peter, you know people like to get all they
can for their property; and it makes no difference to
you, any how, whether I sell you for a big price or a
little one.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, sir, it does, Massr John, kase if a person
gives a thousand dollars for me, he 'lows he's gwine to
work it out of me; but Mr. Friedman just wants me
to wait on him about the store; and he says he'll
cure my cough, too—ugh! ugh! He can't afford to
pay a big price for me, and then doctor me up.”</p>
          <p>“Well, go 'long—I don't want to sell you any how;
I'd rather bring you home to wait on your Miss Sarah,
and to drive the carriage than to sell you for any such
price.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, sir, if you and Miss Sarah was a livin' by
yourselves, I'd like that; but I don't never want to
come back to work on the plantation—ugh! ugh! I
couldn't stand that now. But I belong to you, sir, and
of course I must do just as you say. What shall I do,
Mass'r John?”</p>
          <p>“Go back to town, and stay till I come to see about
you.”</p>
          <pb id="pickard223" n="223"/>
          <p>“Good bye, Mass'r John. Ugh! ugh! Ugh!”</p>
          <p>Thus he coughed himself out of the yard. All the
way back to town he walked with a heavy heart. If
his master would not sell him, all his bright hopes
would yet be blasted. He had, however, done all in
his power. He had used every argument that would be
likely to influence him in whose young hand his destiny
was held—now he could only wait with patience
the result.</p>
          <p>When the young master was next seen in town, the
Jew hired Peter for another year, and with his wonted
cheerfulness of demeanor, the disappointed slave entered
upon the labors of 1849. Was there no sublimity
in his patience ?—no grandeur in his maintenance
of Faith and Hope against the giant forces of Despair?</p>
          <p>It was not long before the young master's aversion to
sell an old family servant was suddenly removed. On
the tenth of January an auction was held in town of
certain goods—the property of his late uncle—“Old
Jimmy Hogan.” Among these “goods,” were ten
choice negroes, two of whom were boys about sixteen
years old. These boys, young John Henry wished to
own; and before they were put up, he called upon the
Jew.</p>
          <p>“Look here, Friedman,” said he, “you want Uncle
Peter, and I want those boys that are for sale to-day.
If you will go in and bid off one of the boys for me, I
will let you have Peter in exchange.”</p>
          <p>“I will think about it. How high will the boys
go?”</p>
          <p>“I don't know,—they're not worth as much as a
tried hand like Uncle Peter. Step in, and see how
the sale goes on.”</p>
          <pb id="pickard224" n="224"/>
          <p>He left the store, and Mr. Isaac immediately held a
consultation on the subject with Peter himself. The
wary slave objected to the plan. “You are not used
to dealing in slaves,” said he, “and you'd best not buy
the boy. There'll be some game about it. If young
master wants to buy him, he'll come round, I reckon.”</p>
          <p>Soon the young gentleman called again to learn
the decision of the Jew. Isaac renewed his former
offer for Peter, but declined to buy the boy.</p>
          <p>“Five hundred dollars is no price for such a servant;
you may have him for six hundred, though he
is worth more.”</p>
          <p>“No—I will not pay six hundred.”</p>
          <p>Away way went Hogun to the auction. The two
boys were soon to be put up. He grew more and
more and more anxious to buy them, and at last determined
to make one more effort to bring the Jew to
his terms.</p>
          <p>“Well, Friedman,” said he, as he stepped into the
store, “you may have Peter for five hundred and fifty
dollars.”</p>
          <p>The black eyes of the Jew twinkled with delight,
but he was firm.</p>
          <p>“I will give you five hundred dollars,” said he,
“my brother authorized me to pay that sum.”</p>
          <p>“But,” argued Hogun, “he is a great favorite in
town—I have been offered six hundred dollars for
him.”</p>
          <p>“I say I will give five hundred; not one dollar
more.”</p>
          <p>The sale was going on—Hogun grew desperate.
The boys he wanted would not wait for bidders, for
they were choice fellows.</p>
          <pb id="pickard225" n="225"/>
          <p>“Well,” said he, as he walked towards the door,
“you may have him for five hundred; but it's a
shame to sell him so.”</p>
          <p>“Then he is mine!”</p>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>“For five hundred dollars!”</p>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>“<sic corr="Very">Yery</sic> well, your money will be ready when you
want it.”</p>
          <p>Hogun hastened back to the auction. The boys
were just going up. He bid off the youngest for seven
hundred and fifty dollars, and the other became the
property of a planter, named W—, a few miles south
of the town.</p>
          <p>It was night. At his desk sat the young Jew, reviewing
the business of the day. Cautiously the door
was opened, and Peter entered the counting-room—
pausing to listen before he closed the door lest some
chance visitor might be approaching. All was still.</p>
          <p>“Now, Mr. Friedman,” said the slave, while his
voice trembled, and his whole frame was agitated, “I've
come to pay you that money; and I reckon you wont
cheat me. I've worked mighty hard to get it. There's
three hundred dollars in this yer bag.”</p>
          <p>So saying he drew the precious treasure from his
pocket, glancing instinctively towards the corners of
the room, to be sure that no spy was there concealed.
He proceeded to untie the bag. It was made of
leather—about twelve inches long, three inches wide
at the bottom, and half that width across the top.</p>
          <p>It contained pieces of silver of all sizes, and now
and then, as they came forth with a melodious clinking,
<pb id="pickard226" n="226"/>
a piece of gold glittered in the lamp-light.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref6" n="6" rend="sc" target="note6">* </ref>
<note id="note6" n="6" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref6"><p>* It was Peter's custom, when he saw a piece of gold in the
hands of a gentleman whom he had served, to ask him if he would
not like change for that. If he received an affirmative reply, he
would bring from his precious bag the amount in small silver coin.
The writer knew him at one time to get ten dollars in five-cent-pieces,
changed for gold. His habits of industry were so well known that
such a request excited no suspicion—the small amount thus changed
at once was presumed to be the sum of the poor fellow's wealth.</p></note>
 When the bag was about half emptied, Peter paused. It would
be so easy for him to lose it all, and he had known so
many slaves defrauded of their hard-earned gains, that
it seemed impossible for him to trust. “But,” thought
he, “I've knowed Mr. Friedman a long time, and I
never knowed him to do a mean trick. If I can't trust
<hi rend="italics">him</hi>, the Lord help me! I can't never be free without
trustin' some person, any how.”</p>
          <p>He emptied the bag upon the table, and both counted
it twice. It was right-three hundred dollars.</p>
          <p>Mr. Friedman wrote a receipt for the money, and
signing it, handed it to Peter. Poor fellow! He could
not read it; but he believed it genuine, and a load
was lifted from his heart. After all, he might be deceived.
He was in this man's power; but he resolved
to trust, and to go to work with all his might to earn
the balance of the sum required to make him <hi rend="italics">a freeman.</hi></p>
          <p>The next day Mr. Hogun received the stipulated five
hundred dollars, and gave a bill of sale, of which the
following is a copy:</p>
          <q type="letter" direct="unspecified">

            </text>
          </q>
          <p>Great sympathy was felt in Tuscumbia for “poor
Uncle Peter.” It was so strange that Hogun would
sell such a faithful old man to a Jew. <hi rend="itlaics">Of course</hi>, Friedman
wanted to make money out of him; and when he
became no longer profitable, he would not scruple to
carry him off and sell him.</p>
          <p>Thus spake gentlemen and ladies; and soon their
children caught the tone. “Don't you think,” said
one bright eyed little girl to another, as they walked
to school, “Uncle Peter is sold!”</p>
          <p>“Sold? I'm so sorry! Who's bought him? Are
they going to carry him off?”</p>
          <p>“No—no not now. Mr. Friedman's bought him;
and 'ma says he's a <hi rend="italics">Jew</hi>, and she says <hi rend="italics">Jews will sell
their own children for money</hi>. Pa says he don't doubt
that Mr. Friedman will sell him the very first chance
he gets to make money out of him; and then, perhaps,
he'll be taken off to the rice swamps.”</p>
          <p>“Oh! that will be too bad! Aunt Milly says that
in the rice swamps they don't care no more for killing
black folks than they do for pigs and chickens. Oh!
I'm so sorry for poor Uncle Peter! But what did
they sell him for? He did'nt run away—nor his master
didn't die.”</p>
          <p>“I don't know what made them sell him, his master
wanted the money, I reckon. Oh! I wish my Pa
<pb id="pickard228" n="228"/>
owned him—he wouldn't sell him, I know. Ma says
she thinks it's a pity for black folks to be sold at all,
but sometimes it can't be helped.”</p>
          <p>“Well, I think it ought to be helped, for they feel
so bad to be carried away off from everybody that
loves them. Just think—if Mr. Friedman should sell
Uncle Peter away off where he never could come back
Oh! wouldn't it be too bad?”</p>
          <p>Said a gentleman, “Why <sic corr="didn't">did't</sic> you let me know,
Peter, that your master wanted to sell you? I'd not
have let that Jew get you. He'll sell you again; or,
perhaps, work you to death.”</p>
          <p>“No, sir, I reckon not,” replied Peter; “Mr. Friedman's
always been mighty good to me, and I reckon
he'll use me fa'r. Leastways, I belong to him now,
and he'll do just as he thinks best.”</p>
          <p>Such was the judgment pronounced upon the noble-hearted
Jew by men and women who had bought and
sold, and beaten, and oppressed the poor until their
cry had gone up to heaven. They considered it <hi rend="italics">their
right</hi> thus to trample on their darker brethren. They
were born slaveholders, and when their servants neglected
their duties, or so far forgot their station as to
speak improperly to their superiors, they must be
beaten, though their heads were grey. Money, too,
was sometimes “tight,” and then the sale of a few of
the young negroes that were “really in the way about
the kitchen” would help to fill the purse. These were
<hi rend="italics">their rights under the Constitution</hi>; but for a Jew to have
such power over a choice old servant was quite too bad.
“A foreigner too! How could he know the feelings
of tenderness cherished by a true Southerner for his
slave?”</p>
          <pb id="pickard229" n="229"/>
          <p>Meanwhile the despised and suspected Jew was arranging,
with the object of all this sympathy, their
future relations to each other. “You may work, as
you did before,” said he to Peter, “but you may keep
your earnings. When you get two hundred dollars
more, I will give you free papers, and you shall go
where you like. I do not want your work—get all
you can for yourself.”</p>
          <p>Did the heart of the slave bound at these words?
Did the tears of gratitude sparkle in his eye? and the
bright beams of hope irradiate his countenance? Ah!
there is One “who seeth not as man seeth,” and in His
eye the generous truthfulness of the slandered Jew
outshone the gaudy hypocrisy of his traducers.</p>
          <p>Peter continued his usual labors with a light heart.
He had now no hire to pay—his earnings were all his
own.</p>
          <p>The night after paying his three hundred dollars to
Mr. Friedman, he went out to make his usual semi-monthly
visit to his wife. How her heart throbbed
when he told her all! Again and again she asked him
if he were sure Mr. Isaac would be true. The children,
too, had their hundred questions. Their father
was very dear to them; and now he possessed new
dignity, even in their eyes. “Just think, he would
soon be free!” No selfish dread that thus he might
be lifted above them dimmed their transparent hearts.
They loved their father, and they could not doubt
him.</p>
          <p>A few months later, a heavy sorrow fell upon this
loving group. The third son, William, who, at Peter's
solicitation, had been hired, as waiter, to Captain Bell,
<pb id="pickard230" n="230"/>
in Tuscumbia, was found drowned in the Spring Creek,
just below the town.</p>
          <p>It was a warm morning in July, and he had obtained
permission to go out fishing. Several boys were near
him bathing, but after a while, they all left him, and
went some distance down the creek. Here they continued
their play till about dinner time, when, as they
came up, one of them noticed a boy's clothes on the
bank. “They're William's clothes,” said two or three
at once. “Where is he?” Alas, they could obtain
no answer to their question, and they ran up to town
and gave the alarm. A crowd of men and boys hastened
to the creek; and after diving for some time,
they found him at the bottom.</p>
          <p>That night the sorrowing father conveyed the lifeless
body of his son to the cabin of his wife, whence he
was buried beside the little ones that in their infancy
had sunk to happy slumbers.</p>
          <p>Poor Vina's heart was almost crushed by this affliction.
William was her darling; indeed he was a
favorite with all who knew him. “Oh!” sobbed his
mother, “I could a seen him die if I'd thought it was
the Lord's will; but to think o' his strugglin' and goin'
down thar all alone, 'pears like, it's more'n I can b'ar.”</p>
          <p>In September of this year, Joseph Friedman returned
from Texas; and soon after, Peter paid to him one
hundred dollars, which he had earned since January.
The Jew seemed delighted at the success of his humble
friend, and congratulated him on the prospect of soon
becoming free. Only one hundred dollars was now
lacking, and that, if he were prospered, he soon could
earn; and then he should be free.</p>
          <pb id="pickard231" n="231"/>
          <p>Patiently he toiled on. His brow was all unruffled,
and no trace of care was visible on his cheerful face.
He moved so quietly in his accustomed course, that
men forgot their jealousy of the Jew, and little maidens
ceased to pity “poor Uncle Peter.”</p>
          <p>Late in the evening of the sixteenth of April, 1850,
Peter sought, once more, the counting-room of Mr.
Friedman. His hand might well tremble as he raised
the latch; for his all was now at stake, and he was
helpless. He entered. There sat the little Jew, looking
at him with his keen black eyes. Timidly he drew
forth his leather bag, and commenced counting out the
money.</p>
          <p>A footstep approached. Mr. Friedman quietly laid
a pile of papers over the coin, and Mr. S—, the
auctioneer, walked in.</p>
          <p>“What, Peter,” said he, “are you paying up?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, sir. Mass'r Joe make me pay him up close<corr>.</corr>”</p>
          <p>“How much do you have to pay?”</p>
          <p>“Well, sir, he makes me pay him half a dollar a
day.”</p>
          <p>“That's pretty <hi rend="italics">tight</hi>, but it's the best way, after all.”</p>
          <p>“Yes—that is so—I like to keep all close. Peter
must pay me promptly.”</p>
          <p>When the neighbor's chat was ended, and they
heard his receding footsteps on the sidewalk, they
finished counting the money. How beautiful it looked
to Peter! that little heap of coin, as he shoved it towards
the Jew, and felt that now his fate hung entirely
on the will of the little man before him.</p>
          <p>Mr. Friedman took up his pen, and wrote a receipt
in full, together with a Certificate of Freedom, as follows:</p>

          <p>Precious was this paper in the eyes of the self-ransomed
slave, and yet he felt not all secure. The habit
of doubting that truthfulness, of which he had so seldom
seen an illustration, could not at once be overcome.</p>
          <p>He had five dollars left, with which he bought a
trunk of Mr. Friedman; and then in one old silver
dollar, which he had kept for many years, consisted
all his store.</p>
          <p>Mr. Friedman had charged him no interest on the
two hundred dollars which he had advanced to purchase
him of Mr. Hogan, and during the last year he
had bestowed upon him many little presents. Jew
<pb id="pickard233" n="233"/>
though he was, and sometimes quoted as a miser, yet
he knew the happiness of being a blessing to the poor.</p>
          <p>Immediately after receiving this last payment from
his servant, Joseph Friedman started for California,
leaving Peter in the care of his brother Isaac. The
whole transaction was still a secret, no mortal save the
two brothers, and Peter's own family were aware that
he had even wished for liberty.</p>
          <p>He was one day engaged in cleaning the church,
when two or three ladies came in to superintend his
labors. Among them was Mrs. D. one of the most
excellent ladies in town. “Peter,” said she, when she
had finished giving him some direction, “you ought
to be free. You have been a faithful servant for a
great many years; and now that you are getting old,
you deserve to have your freedom, instead of being
sold to those Jews.”</p>
          <p>“Oh!” replied he, “what use would it be for me to
be free?”</p>
          <p>“Why then you could do as you chose, and go
wherever you liked.”</p>
          <p>“What! now I've got to be an old man, a'most
fifty? I've got no house nor garden; and if I was free,
I'd have to hire a house, and buy my own clothes; and
then if I should be sick, there'd be nobody to take care
of me. No, ma'am 'taint no use for me to think of
bein' free. I'm too old to be turned off to take care
of myself.”</p>
          <p>Thus carefully did he conceal his real feelings, lest
he should place in greater peril that freedom which he
had so dearly won.</p>
          <p>At the approach of summer, Mr. Isaac Friedman
decided to sell out his stock of goods in Tuscumbia, in
<pb id="pickard234" n="234"/>
order to remove to Cincinnati, where his brother Levi
then resided.</p>
          <p>Peter no sooner learned this plan, than he requested
leave to accompany him as far as Louisville. In all
his intercourse with the Jew, he had never revealed to
him his early history, or breathed to him his own great
wish—that of seeking his parents, and his childhood's
home. But he had often talked of Lexington, and now
he said he should like once more to visit “the old
place.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Friedman readily assented, and Peter commenced
his preparations for the journey. His earnings
since he had finished paying for himself together with
his receipts from the sale of a few articles which he no
longer needed, amounted to eighty dollars. That he
thought, would be sufficient to meet his expenses on
the way.</p>
          <p>The Tuscumbians again became excited. Some gossiping
oracle “<hi rend="italics">reckoned</hi>” that Joseph Friedman had
failed, and straightway that important <hi rend="italics">reckoning</hi> was
announced to be a fact. <hi rend="italics">Joseph had failed, and Isaac
was about to sell off his goods at auction, and quit the
country. Uncle Peter, too was to be dragged off and sold,
or, as some said, to be hired out upon a steamboat, and
thus exposed to all the frightful sickness that then raged
upon the Western rivers.</hi> “Now Uncle Peter,” said one,
“if you find out that those Jews are about to sell you,
just let me know, and I will buy you.”</p>
          <p>“It will be too bad for them to speculate out of you,”
said another, “but I <hi rend="italics">expect</hi> that is what they bought
you for.”</p>
          <p>To all these kind expressions of interest in his welfare,
Peter had but one reply. “Mass'r Joe and Mass'r
<pb id="pickard235" n="235"/>
Isaac always has been good to me; and any how, I
belong to them, and they can do what they like.”</p>
          <p>“What a contented old fellow he is!” said one who
listened to this quiet answer. “I'd like that some of
the abolitionists should hear him talk, they would be
obliged to own that <hi rend="italics">niggers' pining to be free</hi> is moonshine.”</p>
          <p>The Saturday before Mr. Friedman intended to leave
town. Peter went out to pay a farewell visit to his
family. To them he unburdened all his heart. His
great hope had been, if he could once be free, to find
his own relations, whom he always thought of as living
in or near Philadelphia. Then, if they were able, perhaps
they might assist him in the purchase of his wife
and children, and so, at last, they could all dwell together.</p>
          <p>This hope had so inspired the little family at Bainbridge,
that their grief at parting with their beloved
father was lost in the bright vision of a speedy reunion
in the dwelling of the free. They knew nothing
of the difficulties to be encountered; or of the time requisite
to perfect such a work, even if their father were
successful in his search. <hi rend="italics">He had bought his freedom</hi>;
and in their eyes, such an achievement proved him
equal to the attainment of any end. Not thus sanguine
was their father; but he was strong in his fixed resolve
to work while he had breath for the redemption of his
loved ones.</p>
          <p>In sweet, though somewhat mournful, conversation
passed the hours of this precious visit. They were all
too short for the utterance of the many last fond words;
and on Monday morning, when the father was obliged
<pb id="pickard236" n="236"/>
to leave them they had not found time for half they
wished to say.</p>
          <p>The loud horn called them to their labors, and the
children said “Good-bye,” and hastened out—but Vina
lingered. Oh! it was hard to see him go away alone
—but still she would not bid him stay. She mounted
her mule, and rode toward the field, while Peter
walked for a short distance by her side.</p>
          <p>His heart was very heavy, but he uttered not his
gloomy thoughts. He would fain leave her cheerful;
for he knew that ere his return, her heart would oftentimes
be shadowed. So he spoke hopefully of the
future, and bade her never fear for him. “I will
come back,” said he, “whether I find my people or
not—I will come back, and let you know. Now take
care of yourself and the children; and mind they don't
tell the secret.”</p>
          <p>Too soon their paths diverged. When they came
opposite the half-plowed field they stopped. “Well
Peter,” said the brave-hearted wife, “t<hi rend="italics">his yer's your
road, and yon's mine. Good-bye.</hi>” One pressure of
the hand—one last earnest look—and they each pursued
a separate road; the one to slavery's dreary
labors, the other toward that Paradise of hope—The
North.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
          <head>JOURNEY TO PHILADELPHIA.</head>
          <p>ON the twentieth of July, all preliminaries being
arranged, Mr. Friedman and his servant took the boat
for Louisville.</p>
          <p>“Now, Peter,” said Dr. W—, as he shook hands
with him upon the sidewalk, “mind what I tell you;
if those Jews go to sell you, just telegraph to me.”</p>
          <p>“Thank you, sir, I will; but I reckon they ain't
gwine to sell me, any how.”</p>
          <p>Several other gentlemen, as he passed along, gave
him similar assurances; and with the kindest wishes
of all the citizens, he left the town.</p>
          <p>“That is outrageous,” said a kind hearted gentleman,
who watched the faithful servant as he passed
out of sight—“for that Jew to carry off such a fellow
as old Peter, and to have a right to sell him whenever
he likes.”</p>
          <p>Peter paid his fare to Louisville by working on the
boat—The Greek Slave—Captain Francis. When
they reached that city, the cholera was raging fearfully;
and Mr. Friedman thought best to make no
stop, but to hasten on to Cincinnati. Thither also,
Peter obtained permission to accompany him; and at
six o'clock on the morning of the twenty-sixth of
July, the free soil of Ohio was pressed by his weary
feet.</p>
          <pb id="pickard238" n="238"/>
          <p>Now, for a time, he threw off his pretended bonds,
and gave way to his emotions of delight. Springing
from the boat, he clapped his hands in ecstasy, shouting,
“I'm free! <hi rend="italics">I'm free! </hi>This is free ground! The
water runs free! The wind blows free! I am a slave
no more!”</p>
          <p>“Hush! Peter,” said Mr. Friedman, “people will
think you are a fool!”</p>
          <p>That day, in the house of his brother, Levi Friedman,
Peter revealed to his late master the story of his
life. He told him all that he remembered of his early
childhood—of his being stolen, of his brother's life
and death, and of the one hope which had animated
all his labors—that of returning to the spot where he
was born, to find, if possible, his kindred, and to see
his mother's grave.</p>
          <p>Friedman listened with astonishment; and when
Peter described, as well as he was able, his early home,
which he located at Philadelphia, the Jew could not
believe the tale. “No, no,” cried he, “you came from
Kentucky—your master told me so.”</p>
          <p>“Yes,” replied Peter, “so I did come from Kaintucky;
but I was stole and carried there when I was a
little boy. I remember the Delaware river—it was not
far from my mother's house; and that river is at Philadelphia
—leastways, so people has told me. And now
I want to go and see if I can find my relations.”</p>
          <p>The wonder of his auditor was intense. He could
not comprehend how, during all these years, so cruel
a wrong had been suffered to go unredressed.</p>
          <p>“I do not like to have you go away alone,” said he
to Peter. “The cholera is raging on the river, and
you might be sick and die among strangers.”</p>
          <pb id="pickard239" n="239"/>
          <p>But his fears could not detain the enthusiastic freeman.
“Never mind,” said he, “if I die, nobody don't
lose nuthin by me. I'm my own man, any how, but I
reckon I won't die. 'Pears like, now I've got so fur,
my work ain't gwine to be lost.”</p>
          <p>After spending a day and a half at a colored boarding
house in Cincinnati, where he had his clothes all
put in order, he started for Pittsburg. A cousin of
Mr. Friedman accompanied him to the wharf and saw
him on board the boat.</p>
          <p>How anxious was his heart as the steamer dashed
away. He was all alone, and utterly ignorant of the
perils he might meet. But he trusted in the Lord, and
kept a cheerful countenance.</p>
          <p>His characteristic caution prompted him to observe
closely the movements of his fellow-passengers, and
one of them soon absorbed his attention. This was a
short dark man, with a disagreeable expression of
countenance. Peter remembered seeing the same man
on the boat from Louisville to Cincinnati, where he
had made several attempts to draw him into conversation,
without, however, learning anything further in
answer to his questions than that Peter was going to
Cincinnati. Now he renewed his advances, striving to
draw him into conversation, and at last asked him if
his owner were on board.</p>
          <p>“I, don't need any,” said Peter, as he walked
away.</p>
          <p>Soon an elderly gentleman, very genteelly dressed,
approached him, and asked if his master were on
board.</p>
          <p>“I have no master,” replied he, “who said I had a
master?”</p>
          <pb id="pickard240" n="240"/>
          <p>“But you are a slave,” persisted the gentleman, “or at least
have been one. I knew it as soon as I saw you. Where are you going?”</p>
          <p>“I am gwine to Pittsburg, and then to Philadelphia; and I am
a free man. Who said I had a master?”</p>
          <p>“Where did you come from?”</p>
          <p>“From Cincinnati.”</p>
          <p>His interrogator left him in no pleasant mood. Two colored
barbers on the boat had told him that the short dark man was
watching all his movements. He was whispering, too, they said,
among the other passengers, that he knew that fellow was a
runaway; and he would take him up, if he had not other
business to attend to. He was hunting, he said, for a rascal who
had escaped from prison; and he could not undertake another
job.</p>
          <p>When the boat approached Wheeling, several individuals
came to Peter, and offered their advice. The short dark man
kept his eye upon him, but said nothing. One young gentleman
with a pleasant countenance stooped down and said in a low
voice, “Now, my friend, there are a great many watching you;
and if you are free, stand to it. Don't leave the boat;—just say
that you are free.” Seeing some one approaching, the young man
rose up, and walked to another part of the boat. “I thought,”
said Peter, as he narrated this incident, “that the Lord sent that
young man, and that he was a true friend; so I determined to
take his advice.”</p>
          <p>Soon came another. “See here, my friend,” said he, “the
people tell me that you are running away. Now, I am a friend to
colored people. Here is five dollars—you'd better not stop in
Wheeling, for they
<pb id="pickard241" n="241"/>
talk of taking you up. You take this five dollars,
and walk across the bridge—and you'll be in a Free
State, where they can't hurt you.”</p>
          <p>“No, sir, I thank you,” said Peter, “I have paid my
passage to Pittsburg, and I shall not leave the boat. Let 'em
take me up if they like; I can telegraph to my friends in
Cincinnati, and I reckon they can make 'em pay for the time
I'm hindered. Yes; let 'em take me up, if they think best.”</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the bravery of his bearing, he felt
extremely uneasy; and as Mr. Friedman had given him no
instruction respecting the proper method of procedure in
such cases, he was forced to rely alone upon his own
judgment. He readily suspected the hypocrisy of the <hi rend="italics">very
kind friend</hi> who offered him five dollars, and advised him to
hasten across the bridge. Had he accepted the gift and
counsel, he would tacitly have acknowledged himself a
runaway, and so he might have become an easy prey to the
vultures that pursued him.</p>
          <p>But he was not arrested. He saw groups of men
whispering together in different directions—and he knew
they watched him constantly; but he seemed to regard
them with such cool indifference, that they did not venture
to attempt the execution of their plots.</p>
          <p>The boat arrived at Pittsburg early in the morning; and
Peter was conducted by a colored fellow-passenger to the
house of a friend of his, where they took breakfast. After
remaining about five hours in the city, he took the stage to
cross the mountains. He was anxious to reach Philadelphia
as soon as possible, for he was told in Pittsburgh that there
would be a great turn-out of the colored people there on
the first day of
<pb id="pickard242" n="242"/>
August; and that, he thought, would be a favorable time to
seek his kindred.</p>
          <p>He paid for a seat inside the stage; but it being crowded
with passengers, he was requested to ride outside. He
accordingly seated himself beside the driver, where he rode
all day. The grand scenery of the mountains was new to
him, and wonderful. Wife and children were behind. He
could hear their voices, now sad, now trustful, as they
talked of “father,” while their mother cooked their scanty
supper. Subdued were the tones of their dear voices, for on
no strange ear must fall the cherished secret that <hi rend="italics">he</hi> was
free. They little dreamed that he was riding now over these
wild rough mountains. How strange the scene! The tall
hemlocks which sheltered the highest peaks, seemed stern
and unloving—but the warm sun looked down upon them
all.  The same sun even then was shining upon his toiling
loved ones; and oh! perhaps it also shone upon the graves
of all those whom he had come so far to seek.</p>
          <p>Such were his thoughts as, hour after hour, he gazed
upon the ever-varying grandeur of the Alleghanies.</p>
          <p>After travelling by stage about twenty four hours, he
took a seat in a rail-road car. This was another wonder. His
previous ideas of rail-roads had been gained from the only
one he had ever seen—that extending the length of the
Muscle Shoals, and connecting Decatur and Tuscumbia.
On that he had been accustomed to see, once a day, two or
three little rickety cars come jolting into town, loaded
chiefly with freight, but occasionally bringing also a few
tired passengers. These cars were drawn by two or three
sleepy-looking mules or horses; for the <hi rend="italics">snake's-heads</hi>
<pb id="pickard243" n="243"/>
were so numerous upon the road, that the wheezing old
locomotive, which sometimes came down with freight
alone, rendered the journey too perilous for passengers.</p>
          <p>What a contrast to all this was now before him! The
bright locomotive, the long trains of elegantly furnished
cars, and the smooth, level track of Pensylvania road,
astonished him; while the frequent villages he passed, the
highly-cultivated fields, and the substantial farm-houses,
with their great stone-based barns, impressed him with still
greater wonder.</p>
          <p>On the afternoon of the first day of August, the train
reached Philadelphia. Peter sprang to the ground; and,
getting possession of his trunk, he stepped aside, and
stood an amazed spectator of the noisy scene. Porters
accosted him with—“Where want to go, sir?”</p>
          <p>“I don't want to go no further than yer.”</p>
          <p>The crowd began to scatter. Friends met friends, and
departed in their company; every one seemed in haste; he
only was alone and purposeless. Far away on every side
stretched the great city—the goal of all his hopes, perhaps
their grave.</p>
          <p>He stood still by his trunk, till his fellow-passengers had
all dispersed. He knew not where to go. He had been
advised, while in Pittsburg, to go to a certain boarding-house 
in Philadelphia; but the name he could not now
remember. “Suppose,” said he to himself, “some
Abolitionist should come along now, mighty friendly, and
tell me where to go, and so I should be entrapped and sold
again. I must be careful.”</p>
          <p>After he had stood alone for more than half an hour, an
elderly colored man came up, and kindly accosted
<pb id="pickard244" n="244"/>
him. “Do you wish to go to some part of the city,
friend?”</p>
          <p>“Yes,” replied Peter, “I was recommended, in Pittsburg, to
go to a boardin'-house, kept by a Christian man, a
preacher; and I would like to find it.”</p>
          <p>“What is his name?”</p>
          <p>“I can't think. I've been a studyin' all the time since I
stood here, and I can't remember it. I only heard it once in
Pittsburg; but he is a Christian man, and a minister.”</p>
          <p>The stranger suggested many names, and at last
mentioned “Dr. Byas.”     </p>
          <p>“Thar—that's the man—I knowed I should remember it, if I heard it spoke.”</p>
          <p>“Well,” said the stranger, “I know where he lives, and
I will carry your trunk there for a quarter.”</p>
          <p>Peter assented, and followed him. With the trunk upon
his shoulder, the stranger led the way through the
handsomest part of the city; but the beautiful buildings
which they passed scarcely won a glance of admiration
from Peter. His dear dead brother's features were in his
mind's eye; and, in the face of every colored man he met, he
looked to find their counterpart. He gazed in vain. No
lineament of that well-remembered face could he discover
among the passersby, and he was glad when his guide
stayed his steps before the modest residence of the good Doctor.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head>
          <head>THE KIDNAPPED BOY RESTORED TO
HIS MOTHER.</head>
          <p>MRS. Byas herself answered the bell. She was a bright
mulatto woman, with a kind smile and a pleasant voice. Dr.
Byas, she said, was not at home—he had gone to Cincinnati.
Peter explained to her that he was sent there by some
friends in Pittsburg.</p>
          <p>“Oh, well, then, come right in,” said she, “I can take
care of you.”</p>
          <p>He entered the house, and sat down, while the good
woman proceeded to explain to him the cause of her
husband's absence. To this he hearkened not. “Do you
know how fur it is to the Delaware river?” said he.</p>
          <p>“Why, yes—it is right down here at the wharf.”</p>
          <p>He sprang to his feet. “That is just the river I'm a
huntin' for. I was born on that river; and I want to go
down and find the old house where my father and mother
lived—right on the side of the hill.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, stay till I get you some dinner,” said Mrs. Byas,“
and then I will show you the way to the river.”</p>
          <p>“No, no—I must go now—I believe I can find the
house.”</p>
          <pb id="pickard246" n="246"/>
          <p>But she prevailed on him to sit down and eat a lunch;
and then, according to her promise, she directed him to the
river; giving him at the same time her street and number, so
that he might find his way back.</p>
          <p>When he reached the river he walked a long way up the
stream looking for the well-remembered woods upon the
hill-side. But the city stretched a long way up the river, and
as far as he could see, the bank was dotted with the costly
dwellings of the rich;—no humble cottage like the one in
his memory, met his eye; and when thoroughly wearied in
the fruitless search, he returned disappointed to the
residence of his kind landlady.</p>
          <p>She was much interested in the stranger, and to aid him
in his efforts, she sent a man with him into the streets,
directing him to inquire of any aged colored people he might
meet for <hi rend="italics">a man named Levin, and his wife, Sidney, who
lost two children about forty years before.</hi></p>
          <p>This search was unsuccessful; and at night Peter turned,
with weary feet, towards his boarding-house.</p>
          <p>Early the next morning he arose, and with new strength
and energy, re-commenced his search. He found one old
man who had lived in Philadelphia fifty-three years. He told
him that he knew of sixty colored children that were missing
from that vicinity in one year; and in another year forty
were carried off, of whom no trace was ever found. Yet he
had never known the <hi rend="italics">Levin and Sidney</hi> whom Peter
sought.</p>
          <p> Hour after hour he continued these fruitless inquiries; 
and at last he was forced to abandon this
<pb id="pickard247" n="247"/>
method of search, and to return to Mrs. Byas for further
counsel.</p>
          <p>Towards evening the good woman devised another plan.
She told Peter that at the Anti-Slavery Office were kept old
records of colored Churches; and that, as he was sure his
parents were religious people, it was quite possible that their
names might there be found. She, thought it best for him to
go there immediately, and ask them to search these records.</p>
          <p>He did not hesitate to follow her advice; and, with the
same guide who had previously accompanied him, at about
six o'clock, he started for the Office.</p>
          <p>The guide who had been sent by Mrs. Byas had no
confidence in Peter. His story seemed to him <sic corr="improbable">improble</sic>; and
he suspected him of being a spy sent out to hunt for
fugitives. This distrust soon became mutual. Peter dreaded
the Abolitionists of the North, of whose decoying people
away and selling them at the far South he had so often
heard; and as he noticed that the guide spoke frequently in a
low voice to those he met, he feared some net was spreading
for his feet.</p>
          <p>At last they reached North Fifth street, and as they
passed a window of the Anti-Slavery Office, they saw a
young colored man within, writing at a desk.</p>
          <p>“Did you ever see a black man doing that at the South?”
asked the guide.</p>
          <p>“No, indeed,” replied Peter, “if a black man thar knowed
how to write, he'd best keep it a secret.”</p>
          <p>They entered the office. The young clerk whom they had
noticed through the window was there alone. He was
graceful in his bearing and dressed with extreme neatness.</p>
          <p>“Good evening, sir;” said the guide. Here is a
<pb id="pickard248" n="248"/>
man from the South that says he is hunting for his people;
and he wants to make me believe he was born in
Philadelphia. Mrs. Byas sent me here with him—she thought
possibly you might I find the names of his parents on some
of your books.”</p>
          <p>“What were you parents' names?” asked the young man
of Peter.</p>
          <p>“I was stolen away from the Delaware river,” said he,
“with my brother Levin, when I was about six years old. My
father's name was Levin, and my mother's name was
Sidney; and we had two sisters—one name 'Merica and the
other Charity; though my brother always said that 'Merica
was our cousin. One day when our mother was gone, as
we thought, to church, a man came along in a gig, and
asked us if we didn't want to ride. He told us he would carry
us to our mother; so we got up with him. But in place o'
carryin' us to our mother, he taken us off into Kaintucky,
and sold us. We used to talk a heap about our mother, but
nineteen years ago my brother died in Alabama; and now
I've bought my liberty, and come back to hunt for my
relations.”</p>
          <p>The young clerk listened with much apparent interest,
and when Peter had ended his simple story, he requested
him to wait till he had finished putting up those papers for
the Post Office, when he would render him any assistance
in his power.</p>
          <p>Peter constantly grow more uneasy. He could not shake
off the idea that some snare was here laid to entrap him,
and while the young man was busied at his desk, he
slipped along a little nearer to the door, in order that he
might escape if any violence should be attempted.</p>
          <pb id="pickard249" n="249"/>
          <p>When the papers were all prepared for the mail, the clerk
sat down near him, and entered into conversation. “It will
take sometime,” said he, “to look over those old papers,
and this man may as well go home. I will show yon the way
back to Mrs. Byas'.”</p>
          <p>The guide rose to depart,—and Peter prepared to
accompany him. “I'll go, too,” said he.</p>
          <p>“No, no,—stay;” said the clerk, “I will do my best to find
your friends.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, stay—by all means;” added the guide,—if he will
look for them, it isn't worth while to go away now.”</p>
          <p>Peter was greatly frightened. He thought he could
detect a <sic corr="mutual">mntual</sic> understanding between the two, to keep
him there till night, that they might commit
some outrage upon his person; but he knew no way of
escape, for he was a stranger. Trembling, therefore, 
he consented to remain; but seated himself as near as
possible to the door, and watched intently every motion of
the young man whose treachery he so much feared.</p>
          <p>When they two were left alone, the clerk questioned him
further respecting his early memories of home and
mother; and then, looking him in the face, he said, 
“Suppose I should tell you that I am your brother?”</p>
          <p>Had a thunderbolt fallen at his feet, he could not have
been more astonished. But the doubt was uppermost 
in his mind, and with an incredulous look he
answered, only, “Supposin' you should?”</p>
          <p>“Well,” continued the young man, “from all you have
told me, I believe that you are a brother of mine.
My father's name was Levin, and my mother's name is
Sidney; and they lost two boys named Levin and
<pb id="pickard250" n="250"/>
Peter, about the time you speak of. I have often heard my
mother mourn about those two children, and I am sure you
must be one of them.”</p>
          <p>The young man's voice trembled as he spoke; and Peter,
more frightened than ever, knew not what to say. He did not
believe one word the clerk had said; for had he not merely
repeated his own story! At last he spoke: “I want to ask
you one question—is your father and mother a livin'?”</p>
          <p>“My father has been dead some years,” replied the
clerk, “but my mother is still living.”</p>
          <p>“Well, sir,” said Peter, “then your mother is not my
mother; for my mother must be dead. My brother said,
before he died, that he was sure she was dead; and that is
nineteen years ago. Yes, my mother must be dead. I don't
expect to find her alive, but I thought I mought find her
grave.”</p>
          <p>In vain the young man strove to convince him that they
might both be sons of the same mother. In vain he related
little incidents connected with their loss, which he had
heard from his mother's lips. Peter still believed that he was
merely constructing a tale to match his own. “Oh!”
thought he, “what a fool I was to tell him, any how!” </p>
          <p>“Where does your mother live?” asked he, after some
minutes spent in painful thought.</p>
          <p>“She lives in New Jersey, but I have two sisters living in
this city.<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">New Jersey!</hi>” Where could that be? It must be a great
way off, for he had never heard of it. Perhaps it was across
the sea. “New Jersey,” said he aloud,
how far is that from yer?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, it is just across the river. My mother lives
<pb id="pickard251" n="251"/>
fifteen or twenty miles from the city. Come, go with
me to my sister's; one of them lives quite near. She is
several years older than I, and can tell you much more
about our family.”</p>
          <p>“No, sir; if you please, show me the way to my boardin'-house. 
It is night, and I'd ruther go thar.”</p>
          <p>But the young man urged him so strongly, that he at last
consented to accompany him to see his sister Mary, an
unmarried woman, who taught a little school,
and kept a few boarders.</p>
          <p>She was engaged, when they entered, in removing the
tea-things; and, as she supposed Peter was some stranger
who was going home with her brother, she took no special
notice of him. Soon she started to go into the basement,
and the young man followed her. Peter heard them talking,
in a low tone, upon the
stairs, and all his worst fears returned. He had heard of
houses kept by infamous women in cities; and of strangers
being beguiled into them to be robbed and murdered. He
had heard, too, of kidnappers, that employed colored
agents to ensnare their victims; and the perspiration
started from every pore, as he fancied
himself thus entangled. He could not flee, for he knew not
where to go; and if he made inquiries for his boarding-house, 
he might fall into other dangers.</p>
          <p>After a few minutes, which seemed an age to Peter,
the brother and sister returned into the room, and sat,
down. “Sister,” said the clerk, “here is a man who tells a
strange story. He has come to Philadelphia to
look for his relations, and I should like to have you hear
what he has to say.”</p>
          <p>She turned to Peter. “For whom are you looking?” said
she.</p>
          <pb id="pickard252" n="252"/>
          <p>“Oh,” he replied,<hi rend="italics"><corr>“</corr> I'm a lookin' for a needle in a hay-stack: 
and I reckon the needle's rusty, and the stack is
rotted down, so it's no use to say any more about it.</hi>”</p>
          <p>“But tell her,” said the young man, “what you related to
me in the office.”</p>
          <p>He proceeded to repeat his story; but when he spoke the
names of his father and mother, his listener could sit still no
longer. Seizing the candle, and holding it near his face, she
cried, “O Lord! it is one of our lost brothers! I should know
him by his likeness to our mother. Thank God! one of our
brothers has come!” Then checking herself, she turned to
the young brother, “O William, this will kill mother!”</p>
          <p>Peter was still more agitated, yet not convinced. He was
so unprepared for such a joyful greeting, that he could not
believe they were sincere. He promised, however, to come
again in the morning, and to go with her to see an
older sister, who resided in another part of the city.</p>
          <p>After spending a few minutes in further conversation
respecting their family, the clerk, according to his promise,
accompanied Peter to his boarding-house.</p>
          <p>“Good evening, Mrs. Byas,” said he, as he entered the
neat parlor; “did you send this man to the Anti-Slavery
Office this evening?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Sir. I thought he might find some account there of
his people.”</p>
          <p>“Well, he is my own brother.”</p>
          <p>The good woman looked amazed.</p>
          <p>“My parents,” continued the young man, “lost two
children over forty years ago; and from this man's story I
am convinced that he is one of those brothers. And now I
have brought him back here, as I promised
<pb id="pickard253" n="253"/>
at the office; but I want him to go home with me and stay all
night. In the morning I will take him to see other members of
our family.</p>
          <p>“No, sir,” said Peter, who could not yet fully trust his
new-found brother, “I'd as lief stay here to-night; and then
I can go with you in the morning.”</p>
          <p>Mrs. Byas, however, joined in urging him to go home
with <hi rend="italics">Mr. Still</hi>; assuring him that he did resemble him in
looks, and that she doubted not they, were really brothers.
At last, after much persuasion, he reluctantly bade his kind
landlady “good night,” and departed with the clerk.</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Still,</hi>”—thought he as they walked along—“it seems
this man's name is William Still. Then if he is my brother,
that must be my name, too. I wish I knowed. And his
mother has always loved the boys she lost, and talked a
heap about 'em. Well, this is an oncommon case. 'Pears like
they all believe this man's tale; but I can't think my mother's
a livin' yet, and that I've come right on to one of her
children. It seems mighty queer that they all are so ready to
own a stranger, any how. Well, I shall know more about it
to-morrow, when I come to see the other 'ooman; but I'd a
heap ruther staid with Mrs. Byas this yer one night. Thar's
no knowin' what'll happen afore mornin'.”</p>
          <p>Thus, full of doubts and fears, he walked silently beside
his young companion towards his home. This was a
substantial three-story brick house, situated in a retired,
though pleasant part of the city.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Still was absent on a visit to her husband's
relatives in New Jersey; and after eating their supper the
excited brothers separated for the night.</p>
          <pb id="pickard254" n="254"/>
          <p>Peter, when left alone in his chamber, gave way to his
long-pent grief. Oh! why had he thus exposed himself to
every danger? Why did not Mr. Friedman give him more
instructions with regard to his future course. Did he not
know that his path would be beset with dangers? Then
came thoughts of poor Vina, and the children; and he knew
they were thinking of “<hi rend="italics">father,</hi>” and feeling sure he must be
happy now that he was free. Ah well, he was glad they
could not know the dangers which surrounded him. What
could these people intend to do? Oh! if he should find
after all that their tale were true—but it could not be. Perhaps
they were all Abolitionists, and had contrived a plan to
carry him off and sell him.</p>
          <p>For fear that he might fall asleep and be surprised,
he piled the furniture of the room against the door;
looking first under the bed, and examining carefully
every corner, to be sure that no enemy was concealed
in his chamber. He then lay down; and after wearying 
himself with striving to devise some plan of escape
from the imaginary dangers which encompassed him,
he fell asleep. Even then he found no rest, for soon
his room was stealthily entered by armed men. Starting 
from his slumber, he listened to hear their footsteps,—
but all was still. Then he was about to leave
Tuscumbia with his master; and all his clothes were
gone. Again he was in the little cabin where Vina
cared for his children, and prayed for their father, and
ruffians came and tore him from their arms. All night
his dreams were gloomy horrid; and in the morning
he was unrefreshed. Yet the light of a new day was
welcome; for he was anxious to learn more of these
strange people who claimed him as a brother.</p>
          <pb id="pickard255" n="255"/>
          <p>After breakfast he returned to his boarding-house;
where he had a long conversation with Mrs. Byas. She was
utterly unconscious of the existence of his doubts and
fears; yet her frankness of manner, and her evident
confidence in the integrity of “Mr. Still” went far to remove
them from his mind.</p>
          <p>At twelve o'clock he went, according to appointment, to
the house of Miss Mary Still, in order to accompany her in
a visit to other members of her family. She received him with
sisterly affection—manifesting not, by word or look, a doubt
of his being indeed one of her own lost brothers; and the
two soon started for the residence of the other sister who
lived in the city.</p>
          <p>Her name was Kitty. She was several years older than
her sister Mary, and was, at this time, a widow. Her
daughter was standing near the door as they entered, and
inquired for her mother. Away she ran to call her.</p>
          <p>“O mother,” cried she, “Aunt Mary has come and
brought a man with her that looks just like my grandfather.
Come, quick, and see him.”</p>
          <p>“Kitty,” said Mary, as her sister approached, “here
is one of our lost brothers. He came to William last
night, and I am going right away with him to see
mother.”</p>
          <p>Kitty asked no explanation. She saw in him a striking
likeness to both her parents; and after the first burst of joy
was over, she prepared to accompany them. “Yes, I'll go
too;” said she. “How glad I am! What will mother say ?”</p>
          <p>The small steamboat, as it left the wharf that afternoon,
bore no more interesting group than this. The
<pb id="pickard256" n="256"/>
two sisters alternately questioned and congratulated their
new-found brother; and he—his heart was full. Now, for a
moment, he believed that it was real—that they were indeed
his sisters; and then his doubts returned. The joy was
greater than his brightest hopes had promised.</p>
          <p>But of one thing he was sure. He was upon the Delaware
river—that beautiful stream which had ever been the pole-star 
of his hopes. He blessed its bright waters, and its
verdant banks. They had been beautiful in his mind's eye,
and now he felt that even if this new hope were all delusive,
he must yet be near the home of his childhood. He strove
to recall the look that his mother wore when last he saw her
face, and then he wondered how he could for a moment
hope to meet her again in life.</p>
          <p>Thus between hope and fear, between confidence and
doubt, he wavered, till they reached Long Bridge, about
ten miles above the city. Here they landed, and took seats
in the stage for Medford; near which town resided their
brother—Dr. James Still.</p>
          <p>When they arrived at his house, it was nearly dark, and
they thought best to remain there all night, and go to see
their mother the next morning. “There,” said one of the
sisters,“is brother James now walking towards the barn.”</p>
          <p>He turned, and looked towards them, and the moment
Peter saw his face, his doubts departed, to return no more.
He was so like poor Levin, that dear brother who lay low in
Alabama, there could be no mistake. The full tide of joy
rushed over his soul. He had found brothers and sisters!
His mother lived! He should yet see her face.</p>
          <pb id="pickard257" n="257"/>
          <p>For a short time after their arrival, all was excitement and
confusion; the sisters who had accompanied him both
talked at once, and all the family pressed eagerly forward
to greet him who had come, as it were, from the dead. His
resemblance to their family was so striking that they
hesitated not for a moment to receive him as a brother.</p>
          <p>In relating incidents of the long years of his bondage the
evening passed away—that pleasant evening, long will it be
remembered by each member of that little circle.</p>
          <p>Peter's heart was now at rest. He had realized the dream
of his boyhood—the great hope of his riper years. “Oh,”
thought he, “if poor Levin could be with us now; and if
Vina and the dear children were only free, I shouldn't know
what more to ask, for.”</p>
          <p>Early the next morning, Dr. Still, with his new found
brother, and the two sisters set out to visit their mother,
who lived eight miles distant. On the way they agreed, as
far as possible, to avoid surprising or exciting their mother,
as on account of her great age (she was nearly eighty) they
feared that by a shock, even though it were a joyful one,
she might be overcome.</p>
          <p>The venerable woman lived with Samuel, the oldest,
except Peter, of her sons, upon the farm which had been
owned by her late husband. When her children, arrived,
she had just risen, and was standing in the door. Peter's
first impulse was to spring from the wagon, and to clasp
the precious form of his mother to his heart, but his sisters'
caution sounded in his ears, and he struggled to control
himself. Forcing back the
<pb id="pickard258" n="258"/>
flood of tenderness which came gushing up from his
throbbing heart, he walked with placid face behind his
sisters, who advanced to greet their beloved parent.</p>
          <p>“Mother, said Kitty, ”you know it is the custom, when
one of your daughters marries, for her to come home, and
bring your new son-in-law. Now which, of these would you
rather take for your son?“ pointing as she spoke to Peter,
and to the man who had been hired by her brother James to
drive them out. The mother answered with a smile, and the
party entered the house.</p>
          <p>Peter chose a seat near his mother, and subduing his
emotions, gazed earnestly upon her aged face. There was
the same mole concerning which he had so often disputed
with his brother Levin, who always maintained that it was
only a dark spot upon her face. His thoughts were busy
with the past. Ah! how well he remembered the time when
his young lips had pressed that mother's cheek, when all
his childish griefs had been forgotten while he lay folded to
that loving breast.</p>
          <p>He remembered too, the <sic corr="kidnapper">kindnapper</sic>, with his slimy,
lying tongue; his transfer to Kentucky, and the heavy
blows by which they strove to crush out from his young
heart the memory of his mother's love, all his long years of
weary, unrequited toil—a sad procession, passed before
him as he sat apparently a calm spectator of the joyous
greetings of his kindred. His brother also, he remembered,
and that brother's grave, a far-off, unmarked grave, and all
that brother's sorrows. Yes, he remembered all the past.
The host of cruel wrongs which he had suffered rushed at
once
<pb id="pickard259" n="259"/>
into his mind, and from the stand point which he had now
gained, the heartless acts of his oppressors, looked a
hundred fold more hateful than before.</p>
          <p>But he was not long left to his own thoughts. The
excitement of their arrival having subsided, he said to his
mother, “Are all these your children.”</p>
          <p>“Yes,” she replied, “the most of them are mine.”</p>
          <p>“You have a large family.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, I have had eighteen children.”</p>
          <p>“How many have you livin'?”</p>
          <p>“I have buried eight, and I have eight, living.”</p>
          <p>“I thought you said you had eighteen—eight livin' and
eight dead would make but sixteen.”</p>
          <p>The breast of the aged woman heaved as with long-pent
anguish! “Ah!” said she, “them two boys have been
more trouble to me than all the rest of my children. I've
grieved about them a great many years.”</p>
          <p>“What became of them?” asked Peter. </p>
          <p>“I never knew what became of them. I left them asleep in
the bed, the last time I ever see them. I never knew whether
they was stole and carried off, or whether they was dead. I
hope though, they're in heaven.”</p>
          <p>At that moment, her oldest daughter, Mahala,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref7" n="7" rend="sc" target="note7">* </ref>
<note id="note7" n="7" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref7"><p>* Peter remembered her as 'Merica. The little Charity he
also remembered, was the daughter of his mother's sister.</p></note>
 who lived very near, came running in. “Do tell me,” cried she,
half out of breath, “what is the matter? Is any body dead?”</p>
          <p>No one replied. She glanced around the room.
“Who's this?” cried she, talking to mother. “Who is he?
Is n't he one of mother's lost children? He
<pb id="pickard260" n="260"/>
favors the family, and I'm sure he must be one of them.”</p>
          <p>“Who? me?” said Peter.</p>
          <p>“Yes; mother lost two children a great many years ago,
and you must be one of them.”</p>
          <p>“I'm a stranger from Alabama,” said he.</p>
          <p>“I can't help it,” cried the excited woman. “I am sure you
are one of mother's children, for you favor the family.”</p>
          <p>One of the other sisters then approached the mother,
and broke to her the joyful news. The aged woman sat for a
moment bewildered by the strange scene—then rising, she
walked into the next room, where she knelt in prayer.</p>
          <p>In a short time she returned, trembling in every limb,
though her face was calm. “Who are you?”
said she, approaching the stranger.</p>
          <p>“My name,” said he, “is Peter, and I had a brother
Levin. My father's name was Levin, and my mother's name
was Sidney —.”</p>
          <p>The mother raised her tear-dimmed eyes to heaven.
“O, Lord,” she cried, “how long have I prayed to see my
two sons! Can it be that they have come? Oh! if you are my
child, tell me <hi rend="italics">how d'y'</hi> once more!”</p>
          <p>The long-lost son was blest. He, clasped his mother to
his warm, full heart, and joyful tears stole down his dusky
cheeks.</p>
          <p>One week he spent with his new-found kindred. As he
related to them the history of his years of bondage, and
described the strangely varied scenes through which his
path had led, his listeners were never weary; and when he
told of all poor Levin's sorrows, of his
years of  patient suffering, and his peaceful, happy
<pb id="pickard261" n="261"/>
death, the spirit of their departed brother seemed to hover
near the little circle, and to whisper to each whisper to each
weeper there—“Dry now your tears, for where I dwell are neither bonds nor tortures—sorrow and sighing are unknown.”</p>
          <p>Peter soon discovered that the habits and condition of
his relatives differed widely from those described in the
South as universal among “free negroes.” They were all
industrious and frugal; and consequently, in comfortable
circumstances.</p>
          <p>He did not envy them, but, as he noticed their
intelligence, and saw the comforts by which they were
surrounded in their own homes, he could not avoid the
thought that <hi rend="italics">slavery had kept him ignorant and poor. </hi>“But
times will change,” thought he, “and if ever I get my family,
my children shall have a chance to know as much as
others.”</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
          <head>PETER'S FAREWELL VISIT TO ALABAMA.</head>
          <p>GLADLY would his friends have retained Peter in their
midst, but his plan was fixed. He determined to return
immediately to the South, that he might acquaint his family
with his success, and arrange some plan for their
redemption. He felt that he could not himself enjoy the
blessings of freedom, and the sweet society of those who
loved him while his own wife and children toiled in
hopeless bondage.</p>
          <p>To his proposed return his friends, at first, refused to
listen. They could not bear to lose him now, when they had
just learned to love him, and they felt sure that if he went
again to Alabama they should see his face no more.</p>
          <p>It would be far better, they said, for his family to gain
their liberty by flight, and perhaps if he would remain, some
one would go and aid them to escape. It would be so
hazardous for him to venture where, if his secret were
discovered, he might be thrust into jail, and sold upon the
block. But he was firm. He knew the dangers which awaited
him, yet he had promised his family that he would return;
and he would rather lose his life than forfeit his word to
them. He knew
<pb id="pickard263" n="263"/>
how anxiously they would watch for his coming; he knew
how their hearts would faint if he delayed;— ah! he knew
that his love was the one blessed light which shone upon
poor Vina's darkened path. From his own lips she should
first hear of his great happiness, and together they would
try to devise a plan by which herself and children might
come to share his joy.</p>
          <p>Perhaps he could purchase their freedom. This had ever
been his hope; and though his friends believed it was
impossible, they failed to shake his confidence in the
wisdom of making the attempt. <hi rend="italics">He had rescued himself
from bondage</hi>, and he knew “no such word as <hi rend="italics">fail.</hi>” “I can
die,” said he, “but I cannot live without tryin' to do
something for my family—I must go back.”</p>
          <p>With many tears, the affectionate circle bade him adieu.
“O, my child! my child!” sobbed his aged mother. “I never
shall see your face again. You can't get back; and your
poor old mother will go down to the grave a mournin' for
her son. May the Lord bless you wherever you go, and
deliver you from every danger!”</p>
          <p>On the eighth of August, Peter left Philadelphia, on his
return to Alabama. He feared that if he remained longer in
that city, he might meet some, merchant whom he knew;
as at that season they were accustomed to come on for
their Fall goods. If a Tuscumbian should see him there, the
news would swiftly fly, that he had run away from Mr.
Friedman; and then he could not return, even with free
papers, to complete his cherished plan.</p>
          <pb id="pickard264" n="264"/>
          <p>A kind Providence, however, attended him; and he
reached Cincinnati without meeting a familiar face.
Strangely commingled were his emotions, as he returned.
The regretful voices of his brothers and sisters still
sounded in his cars; and the memory of all their kindness
during his short stay, was warm within his heart. He
rejoiced that he had found them. Even if he should never be
able to return to them, the dark uncertainty which had so
long hung over his parentage, and had shrouded all his life
in gloom, was gone. Not less did he rejoice in the character
of his newly-discovered kindred. They were evidently
honest people—trusted and respected by the surrounding
community. They had enjoyed great privileges too, for they
were all well educated; yet they were not proud. Ah, well, it
was some satisfaction that he had ever done the best he
could. He had risen above all who had been his companions
in bondage, and he felt that, though he was ignorant of
books, his friends had no cause to be ashamed of him.</p>
          <p>Arrived at Cincinnati, he related to his former master all
his success, and communicated also his plans for the
future. The Jew was both astonished and delighted at the
good fortune of his humble friend, and readily promised to
aid him, if possible, in negotiating for the purchase of his
family.</p>
          <p>Peter remained in Cincinnati a week, waiting for his free
papers. These he was anxious to possess on his return to
Alabama, as something might occur
which would render it necessary for him to prove his
freedom. At last he obtained the valued certificate, of
which the following is a copy:</p>

          <p><hi rend="italics">Peter was now a man</hi>. His years of patient toil for noble
objects had not made him such—his warm, unselfish heart
had never proved him worthy of the ennobling title—<hi rend="italics">but he
possessed free papers</hi>. Guard well the treasure, Peter; for
<hi rend="italics">the papers lost</hi>, you may again be bought and sold—a thing
of merchandise—<hi rend="italics">a slave.</hi></p>
          <p>Immediately after receiving his papers, he started
for Tuscumbia. He wore not proudly his new honors,
but laying the precious certificate in the bottom of his
trunk, he travelled meekly as a slave upon a “pass”
from Mr. Friedman. This <hi rend="italics">pass</hi> was directed to Mr.
Alexander, of Tuscumbia, a gentleman who had once
before acted as his guardian, during the temporary
absence of both the Friedman's. It requested this
gentleman to permit Peter to stay at Tuscumbia as
long as he should wish to do so; and to send him back
whenever he should be ready to return;—as his labor
could be made profitable on a steamboat, and his
owner could also take better care of him if he had him
near himself.</p>
          <p>Nothing of interest occurred on the homeward journey.
The boat reached Tuscumbia Landing on the evening of
the last day of August; and early the next morning, Peter
walked up to town.</p>
          <pb id="pickard267" n="267"/>
          <p>Many were the friendly greetings he received as he
passed through the streets that day. Many questions were
asked him concerning Mr. Friedman—his business
prospects, etc. To all these Peter replied as he had been
instructed. Mr. Friedman would be there before Christmas,
and if Peter worked till that time on a steamboat, he should
then come with him. Mr. Friedman said he could earn him
more money upon a boat than any where else, and had
promised to give him something for himself if he did well.</p>
          <p>Many gentlemen questioned him very closely respecting
the Free States; how he liked Cincinnati, and whether he
saw there any <hi rend="italics">Abolitionists.</hi></p>
          <p>His ideas of these “<hi rend="italics">desperate characters</hi>” had been
greatly modified during the week which he had spent
among his relatives; but he answered in accordance with
his old ideas—ideas which are carefully inculcated in the
minds of slaves. He was “mighty skeered,” he said, all the
time he was in Cincinnati; and did not dare to go out “after
night.” One night, he “reckoned” he heard the
“Abolitionists fightin' in the streets;” but he was away up
stairs, and “too badly skeered to come down.”</p>
          <p>To all these questionings he answered as truly as he
could, and kept his secret; but they made him very
uneasy. He saw that the moment he should speak a
word in favor of the Free States, he would be suspected, 
and all his movements watched. Then, if the
secret of his freedom should be discovered, his kind
friend, the Jew, would be drawn into trouble, as the
citizens would at once accuse him of sending back a
<hi rend="italics">free negro</hi> to poison the minds of the surrounding
slaves. So he represented the black people of Cincinnati
<pb id="pickard268" n="268"/>
as being wretchedly poor; and the contrast which he
drew between the laborers of that city, and the <hi rend="italics">happier
slaves</hi> by whom he was surrounded, would have delighted
the author of the “South Side View.”</p>
          <p>The same day on which Peter arrived in town, a letter
came from Mr. Sloan, Principal of the Seminary. He was
then spending the Summer vacation at the North; and he
wrote to request Peter to whitewash the Seminary, and to
put the whole building in complete order, for as he intended
to bring on a now corps of teachers, he wished to find the
place prepared for their reception.</p>
          <p>This was most fortunate for Peter. He entered, at once,
upon this work, and soon fell into the old channel of
promiscuous labors. His cheerfulness remained unchanged—
indeed he was the same industrious, respectful, obedient
servant; and those of the Tuscumbians who had most
jealously watched his movements, at last decided that not
even a trip to Cincinnati could spoil Uncle Peter—he had too
much sense to be carried away with the folly of the
Abolitionists.</p>
          <p>The Saturday evening after his arrival in town, Peter
rode out to Bainbridge. He would have gone sooner, for he
was most impatient to see his beloved family; but he had
determined to resume his old habits, and to do nothing
which could betray the least unusual excitement of his
feelings.</p>
          <p>As he rode along the lonely road, his thoughts were
busy. Only six weeks had passed since last he saw his dear
ones, but even in that short time what a wealth of
experience had he gained! He had seen—had tasted— 
liberty;—yet he could not enjoy it. He 
<pb id="pickard269" n="269"/>
could never, indeed, be really free, while those he loved so
well were slaves. But how should he get them? He knew
not what course would be the best, but he knew how to
trust in that Good Father, who had thus far prospered him
in all his ways. He resolved to work hard, and earn all he
could, for whatever plan he might adopt, money would
never fail to be of use.</p>
          <p>But perhaps even now, and his thoughts 
grew sad,—some one of that little number had gone 
down to the grave.
The sickly season was at its height; and Death, within the
last few weeks, had entered many a lowly cabin, and many
a lofty hall.</p>
          <p>He hastened on, yet it was quite dark before he reached
the plantation. He halted at the door of Vina's cabin, and
glanced anxiously at the group within. They were all there.
Vina was preparing to cook the supper, and the boys were
busied in making a fire for her. Thank God!  they all lived!</p>
          <p>His approach was not long unperceived. “Yes, it is
father!” burst at once from the lips of the two sons, and
after the first joyful how'dy', they took his horse and led it
away.</p>
          <p>“O Vina,” whispered Peter, as he still held her by both
her hands, “I've found all my people. I've seen my mother!
Vina, my mother's a livin', and I've got five brothers and
three sisters!”</p>
          <p>Soon the boys came in, and then the history of the
journey, with its glad results, was narrated to them all. How
they marveled as he described to them the great cities
through which he had passed, and all the new strange
sights his eyes had seen! But still greater was their
wonder at the story of their far-off
<pb id="pickard270" n="270"/>
kindred, to whom their father had come as from the dead.
And then to think that father's people were all free! Ah!
how the faint hopes they had cherished of joining their
father, at some future day, in the happy home he would
provide for them, away off where all were free—how these
hopes grew and strengthened in their hearts till they could
scarcely refrain from shouting them aloud! Yet they were
silent. All these bright visions of the coming joy they shut
closely in from the curious eyes of their outside
companions—in their mother's cabin only, and even there
with caution might they give utterance to their joyful
hopes.</p>
          <p>Peter's return caused much excitement among the slaves
on the plantation. It was whispered around that he had
been to Cincinnati, and they were all eager to learn what he
saw there; and how the people lived in a Free State. The
mistress also questioned him concerning his new manner
of life upon a steamboat—how he enjoyed it, etc. He replied,
that he liked the business very well; and that his master
was very kind to him.</p>
          <p>“Mass'r Isaac says he'll buy my family, if I do well,”
added he, “do you reckon old Mass'r would sell 'em,
Ma'am ?”</p>
          <p>“I don't know,” replied the lady, “he thinks a great deal
of them all, and I reckon he would ask a high price for
them. I don't believe less than three thousand dollars
would buy them all, if indeed he would consent to let them
go at all.”</p>
          <p>To his wife and children Peter revealed all his plans for
their redemption. He would work, he said, in Tuscumbia, till
he had earned enough to bear his expenses
<pb id="pickard271" n="271"/>
back to Philadelphia. He dared not stay in Alabama
longer than was necessary, for fear something might occur
which would compel him to reveal his cherished secret.
While there his liberty was all the time unsafe.</p>
          <p>On his return to the North, he intended to set diligently
to work, to earn money to buy his family; and he hoped his
brothers would be able to advance a part of the price. This
could soon be refunded to them, when they were all free
and able to work together. He mentioned to them, also, the
suggestion which some of his friends had made with regard
to sending a man to assist them to escape. “My people
told me,” said he, “that folks are runnin' away <hi rend="italics">constant</hi>, and
gwine to Canada, a place away to the North, where they
never let the masters go to hunt them.” But still there were
so many chances for them to be taken and carried back
before they could reach that distant haven, that he
decidedly preferred to purchase them. Yet, “if they do send
for you,” said he, “you must be ready—and do the best you
can.” They were all willing to do whatever he thought best.
The bright hope of freedom <hi rend="italics">with their father</hi> illumined all
the paths which Fancy painted in the future.</p>
          <p>Early on Monday morning, Peter returned to town, and
resumed his accustomed labors. His first business was to
put the Seminary in order, according to Mr. Sloan's request.
His manners and appearance were all unchanged. He wore
his blue jean roundabout and trousers; and as he stood
among the waiters in the dining-room of Mr. Horne's hotel,
none of the
<pb id="pickard272" n="272"/>
boarders dreamed that he was that despised and hated
biped—“a free nigger.”</p>
          <p>For two months and a half he remained in Tuscumbia;
and during that time he earned sixty dollars. Once in two
weeks, as had been his custom for many years, he went to
see his family. He would have gone every week, now that
he was so soon to leave them, but he dreaded to excite
observation by any change in his old habits; and besides,
he would have to hire a horse to ride, and that would
diminish his gains.</p>
          <p>On Saturday, the ninth of November, Peter rode out to
the plantation for his last visit. He had sold every article he
possessed, except his necessary clothing, and such articles
as he knew would be useful to his family. With these last
his horse was now loaded, and at sunset he rode up to the
cabin door.</p>
          <p>His family were expecting him, and they knew this would
be his last visit. Its hours were, therefore, doubly precious.
Oh!  if they should be the last which the whole family might
ever spend together!</p>
          <p>He renewed his promise to buy them, if possible,
and charged them to hold themselves ready. “Now,
boys,” said he, “you'd best not marry till you hear
from me, for if I live, I will get you all, sure. And
be good and kind to your mother, for she'll have no
one to take care of her now but you. Get every thing
you can to make her comfortable;—and you, Catharine, 
dont you do any thing that will make your
mother ashamed of you,—for she has a heap of trouble,
any how, and you all oughtent to give her no more. Behave
yourselves well; and then people will trust you, and you
will be well thought of by every one.”</p>
          <pb id="pickard273" n="273"/>
          <p>About five miles above Bainbridge in the Muscle
Shoals, is an island containing about two hundred acres,
which belongs to Mr. McKiernan. Here young Peter and
Levin were to be employed during the week; and, as the
cotton-picking season was then at its height, they were
obliged to go with their week's allowance on Sunday
evening, that no time might be lost on Monday.</p>
          <p>After the boys had gone, Peter's friends—and he had
many on the place—all called to say, “Good bye,” till
Christmas; when they expected he would come, as usual, to
spend the Holidays.</p>
          <p>These partings over, he was left alone with his wife and
daughter. Poor Vina! she possessed not the buoyant hopes
that filled her children's hearts—she was not so young as
they;—and though she lacked not confidence in her
husband's truth, yet she could not quell the fear that this
was the last evening they should ever spend together. She
selected from her simple wardrobe two or three articles of
clothing which he had been accustomed to see her wear,
and gave them to him. “When you want to see something
that looks like me,” said she, “you can look at these yer.
They'll make you think of Vina.”</p>
          <p>Monday morning came, and Vina and Catharine must go
early to the field, while the husband and father was forced
to return to town to complete the arrangements for his final
departure. They all arose at dawn and in the dim morning
twilight—they parted.    </p>
          <p>Peter lingered a moment at the cabin door. How 
could he say “Good bye!”
There stood his wife and daughter—and great tears were
in their eyes. How 
<pb id="pickard274" n="274"/>
gladly would he shield them from every breath 
of sorrow!—but now he could not stay. 
Once more he kissed them both—ah! was
 it for the last time? He could not speak, but with
one long pressure of their hands, he tore himself away,
and mounted his horse, which stood already at the door.</p>
          <p>How the sobbings of these loved ones resounded
the depths of his fond heart! For a moment he almost
wished he had not thought of becoming free; but then the
great glad hope of saving them returned, and he rejoiced
that he had power to make the effort.</p>
          <p>Heavy were the hearts of the mother and her children, as
they traversed the long cotton rows that day; but their
fingers must needs be light. The overseer's whip takes no
note of aching hearts. The baskets must be filled.</p>
          <p>The light of hope soon returned to her children's eyes, but
Vina was still in darkness. Accustomed to the
helplessness of slavery, she could not realize that it was
possible for her husband to be safe, “'way off yon' by
himself, without anybody to take care of him.”</p>
          <p>The next Wednesday morning, November 13th, Mr.
Alexander, to whose guardianship Peter had been consigned 
by Mr. Friedman, placed him on board the stage
for Eastport, a small town at the foot of Colbert's
Shoals, about thirty miles below Tuscumbia. (The
water was, at this time, so low in the river, that boats
could not pass these shoals.) Here he took passage
on a small steamboat, with the Captain of which, Mr.
George Warren, he was acquainted.</p>
          <p>This boat, however, went no further than Paducah, at
the mouth of the Tennessee, and there he was
<pb id="pickard275" n="275"/>
obliged to wait for a boat to ascend the Ohio. Soon one
came along—a Cincinnati boat—bound homewards from
St. Louis.</p>
          <p>Peter stepped on board and inquired for the Captain,
while two boys from Captain Warren's boat were bringing
on his trunk. The boat was again under way, before the
Captain could be found. “Here,” said the clerk, as at length
his superior officer appeared, “this
man wants to go to Cincinnati.”</p>
          <p>“Why didn't you name it before?” cried theCaptain in a
passionate voice; and, turning to the pilot, he ordered him
to land and “set that fellow ashore.”</p>
          <p>“But,” said Peter, “I did inquire for the Captain—”</p>
          <p>“Never mind, never mind, step right off.”</p>
          <p>“I have got a pass and other papers, and I want to go to
Cincinnati, or leastway, to Louisville.”</p>
          <p>“Never mind—step right off—step right off.”</p>
          <p>Captain Warren seeing the distress of his humble friend,
called out to the Commander of the Cincinnati boat—“It is
all right—let the boy go. He has a pass, and everything
regular.”</p>
          <p>But the little great man was inflexible. “Step
 right off—step right off”—was 
his only answer; and Peter was obliged
to go ashore and wait for another boat.</p>
          <p>This was Saturday evening, and here he remained till
eleven o'clock on Sunday night, when Captain Francis' boat
came down from Louisville. This was a Tennessee River
Packet, but on account of the low water, she could not go
up the river, and so made only short trips between
Louisville and Paducah. Captain Francis having resided
many years in Tuscumbia, knew Peter well, and therefore
hesitated not to take him up the river on his boat.</p>
          <pb id="pickard276" n="276"/>
          <p>They reached Louisville on Wednesday morning, and as
he would have several hours before the Cincinnati boat
went out, he went to see Dr. Williamson Fisher, a son of his
old master, John Fisher, of Lexington.</p>
          <p>This gentleman received his father's former slave with
great kindness; though he was so young when the two
boys were sold to old Nattie Gist, that he scarcely
remembered them. He had, however, in his possession the
bill of sale which his father received at the time he bought
them.</p>
          <p>This short visit was highly enjoyed by Peter. The days
of his childhood came vividly to his recollection
and though they were not free from hardships, yet the
sunshine of youthful hope had never ceased to gild their
memory. What were the buffetings he then received
compared to the anguish which he had suffered in later
years. As a “<hi rend="italics">little negro,</hi>” he rose each morning from his
ample couch—the floor, with supple limbs, and heart
unmindful of the old day's sorrows, and ate with a keen
relish his homely breakfast of corn cake. He thought of his
far-off mother, and longed to return to her—but his attention
was easily diverted by surrounding objects, and he was,
after all, a merry child. During his manhood he had suffered
few of the physical ills of slavery—but t<hi rend="italics">he iron had entered
his soul.</hi> He had seen his fellows crushed—his brother
beaten, even by the master whom he loved, because he
could not stifle the pure affections of his heart; his own
loved wife had been insulted—and well nigh murdered,
because she would not submit to the vile wishes of a
remorseless ruffian; and yet he had not dared to raise his
voice, or lift his own right arm in their defence.</p>
          <pb id="pickard277" n="277"/>
          <p>All these <sic corr="reminiscences">remniscences</sic> of other days crowded his
memory as he stood in the presence of him who, when an
infant in the cradle, was his “little master,” and who had
inherited from his father the price of his young
nerves and sinews. And then came the sweet thought, that
by his own exertions, through the blessing of that Father
who had never yet forsaken him, he was no more a slave.</p>
          <p>Dr. Fisher gave him much information concerning his
early companions in Lexington; from many of whom he
had not heard since he left there in his youth; but before he
was half satisfied with listening to these interesting details,
his time was spent, and he was forced to leave.</p>
          <p>He next went in search of a young Mr. Johnson, from
Tuscumbia, to whom Mr. Alexander had sent a letter
bespeaking his assistance, if necessary, in procuring a
passage for the bearer to Cincinnati. This gentleman was
pursuing the study of medicine in Louisville; and Peter
went to the Medical College, and to various other places in
the city, but failed to find him.
He was now at a loss what to do, for he had learned from his
experience at Paducah how little favor his pass would gain
from the Captains of the Cincinnati boats.</p>
          <p>He walked down to the wharf, and the first man he
met there was a young Mr. McFarland, from Tuscumbia, 
who had formerly been clerk on Captain Francis'
boat. Mr. O'Reilly of the Telegraph was also there,
and he immediately recognized Peter, having employed 
him during the time he spent in Tuscumbia to
take care of his office. These two gentlemen kindly
procured a passage for him on the boat to Cincinnati,
<pb id="pickard278" n="278"/>
and with many thanks for their friendly assistance, he went
on board.</p>
          <p>He had now bid a final adieu to slave-land, still his heart
was not at rest. For himself he had little fear. His free <sic corr="papers">papars</sic>
were safe, and he was at length beyond the necessity of
affecting any relationship to slavery. But his family—ah!
when he thought how long a time might pass before they
could be loosed from bondage, he could only trust in the
power above, and pray for patience.</p>
          <p>He was disappointed in his hope of finding Mr. Friedman
in Cincinnati, he having gone to Illinois. Peter therefore
hastened on to Pittsburg, and thence to—Philadelphia. His
free papers he carried in his pocket, but as no zealous
negro-catcher chanced to fix upon him his greedy eye, he
had no need to show them on the way.</p>

          <pb id="pickard279" n="279"/>
          <head>CHAPTER XXXI.</head>
          <head>THE ESCAPE.</head>
          <p>LATE at night, on the thirtieth of November, Peter
reached his brother's house in Philadelphia. He trembled
not now, as when at first his foot approached
his kinsman's threshold. A sense of personal security
rested upon his heart, and the light of quiet happiness
beamed from his smiling face.</p>
          <p>During the few days which he spent with his brother
William, the idea of sending a man to rescue his family
was again suggested. Many of his brother's friends were
earnest advocates of such a plan. It would take too long to
raise the sum requisite to purchase them,
and besides, the offering of money for their ransom would
in some sense recognize the <hi rend="italics">right</hi> of the slaveholder to
claim property in human flesh. “We are anxious” they said,
“to aid your loved ones in escaping from bondage, but we
cannot bear to give gold to him who has so long defrauded
the helpless laborers of their hire.”</p>
          <p>To all these arguments of his friends, Peter opposed
the dangers of their scheme. It would, he said, be very
difficult for them to escape; and then, if they should be
pursued and taken, the sufferings of their whole past lives
were nothing to the punishment they
<pb id="pickard280" n="280"/>
might receive. And worst of all, they might be sold; and
then all chance of getting them would be for ever lost.</p>
          <p>But those to whose proposal he objected were educated
men, while he was but a poor emancipated slave, who
never in his life had read a book—and their persuasions
triumphed. He described to them, though with reluctance,
the location of the premises where his family might be
found, and also the persons of his wife and children.</p>
          <p>He then left these friends to mature their plan, while he
went to visit his mother. He was deeply anxious concerning
the result of the deliberations then going on in
Philadelphia, for he could not yet give up the idea which he
had so long cherished—that of attempting the purchase of
those whose safety he prized above all other objects.</p>
          <p>Many people in the vicinity of his mother's home had
heard of the return of the long-lost son and brother, and
now, when they learned his anxiety to redeem his family
they kindly volunteered to aid him. He accepted with a
grateful heart the contributions which they offered, though
<hi rend="italics">how</hi> they could be made available was still a question.</p>
          <p>When he had been two weeks in New Jersey, he
received a letter requesting his immediate return to
Philadelphia, and he hasted to obey the summons. He had
already received one hundred dollars as the beginning of a
fund to ransom those he loved, and that he took with him
to the city.</p>
          <p>During his absence, a man named Seth Concklin, who
had heard of his case, had offered to go to Alabama, and
bring his wife and children. He asked no
<pb id="pickard281" n="281"/>
further equipment for the journey than sufficient money to
defray his necessary expenses, and some sign whereby the
family would recognize him as a friend.</p>
          <p>Peter's heart trembled. To the proposal of his friends he
had assented; but then it was indefinite, and he doubted
the possibility of their finding a man who would face the
dangers of such an undertaking. He had all the time
cherished a secret hope that they would yet abandon this
project, and aid him in accomplishing the plan which he so
much preferred. Not that he thought it would be unjust or
wrong to aid them to escape. Ah, no! He had never yet
become so thoroughly enslaved in spirit as for a moment to
recognize the <hi rend="italics">right</hi> of man to hold his brother man in
bonds; but merely as a matter of policy he had chosen to
purchase their freedom—though to do so would cost him
both toil and patience.</p>
          <p>Now, however, the scheme was all arranged, and these
good friends had manifested so warm an interest in
promoting his happiness that he could not refuse them all
the aid which it was in his power to give.</p>
          <p>He accordingly gave Concklin an accurate description
of Mr. McKiernan's place, with directions concerning the
best methods of approaching it. He told him also the names
and ages of his family; and gave him a cape of Vina's— 
one of the articles of dress which she had given him as a
keepsake. “When she sees this,” said he, “she will know
that you are a friend; but please, sir, be careful and don't
get 'em into trouble. It'll go mighty hard with 'em if they try
to run off, and Mr. McKiernan cotches 'em.”</p>
          <p>The one hundred dollars which Peter had received
<pb id="pickard282" n="282"/>
in New Jersey was now devoted to defraying the cost of
this expedition, and early in January, all the arrangements
having been completed, Concklin entered upon his perilous
undertaking.</p>
          <p>We subjoin the account which is given by Rev. Dr.
Furness, of Concklin's introduction to the friends of the
slave in Philadelphia, and also of the first steps that were
taken in this daring enterprise.</p>
          <p>“Of this remarkable person, whose history, and heroic
tragedy, must not be suffered to die, but very little was
known at that time. He was not a member of any Abolition
Society, nor was it known that he had any fixed residence.
A man, plainly dressed, and slightly built, but evidently
active and vigorous, with a face expressive of great
decision, had come occasionally to the Anti-Slavery Office
in Philadelphia, to inquire about Mr. Chaplin, then in
prison in Maryland, for aiding certain slaves in an attempt
to escape from the District of Columbia. The stranger
manifested a deep interest in Mr. Chaplin's fate,
contributed a small sum monthly to the Chaplin fund, and
on one occasion produced a statement in writing of a plan,
which he had devised, subject to the approval of Mr.
Chaplin's friends, whereby he offered to go to Maryland,
liberate Mr. Chaplin, and bring him safely into the Free
States; requiring only a moderate sum to defray his
expenses. The scheme was striking for its boldness and
sagacity, but all participation in it was declined by the agents 
of the Anti-Slavery Society, on the obvious ground
that it was not by such methods that they were seeking the
Abolition of Slavery. (It is not an object of the Society to
assist, directly or indirectly, in the abduction
<pb id="pickard283" n="283"/>
of slaves.) The proposals, however, on the part of
Mr. Concklin, served to show the character of the man. It
was made apparent that he was an Abolitionist on his own
account. He was understood to be one of those few men in
whom the hatred of slavery has become a ruling passion.
He was a whole Abolition Society in himself; with very
limited pecuniary means indeed, but with, what is infinitely
better than uncounted gold, a single and commanding
purpose, which danger could not shake, but only animate.
His subsequent history, and all that was afterwards
ascertained of his previous life, only corroborated the impressions 
received of his character “upon the occasions of
these visits to the Anti-slavery office. He was a
man whose constitutional love of adventure, exercised
from early boyhood by a series of privations and trials that
would have broken down any ordinary man,
had come to be consecrated to the knightly office of
succoring the miserable; and especially the enslaved,
as of all men the most to be commiserated. In contrast with
his tried heroism, the wordy chivalry of the South shows
as rags and tinsel.</p>
          <p>“As soon as he was informed of the condition of
Peter's family, he offered, with the help of a small sum to
defray his travelling expenses, to go to Alabama, and bring
them into the free State of Pennsylvania. He asked for no
companion, and no compensation; only for the means of
paying the expenses of the journey, and for credentials to
satisfy Peter's wife that he came from her husband.</p>
          <p>“A daring enterprise, indeed! It is not easy to conceive
of an undertaking more hazardous, or one that more
peremptorily demanded, in him who should
<pb id="pickard284" n="284"/>
attempt it, all the qualities that give the world assurance
of a man.</p>
          <p>“The plantation that Seth Conklin was to reach lay
in the north-western part of Alabama, eight hundred
miles from Cincinnati. He was to traverse two slave
States—Kentucky and Tennessee. To penetrate thus
deep into slave-land, at a time when the ferocity and
the fear that guard it had been startled from their long
slumber by the far-off coming of the step of doom, for
the purpose of plucking therefrom a poor bondwoman
and her children, outdoes all the fabled feats of old
knighthood.</p>
          <p>“Our hero took with him neither pistol nor bowie-knife,
although he knew how to use them, for, as
has since been learned, he had been a soldier. ‘He
should be tempted to use them,’ he said, ‘and then he
should be sure to be overborne.’</p>
          <p>“His first object was to explore the route, to discover
safe hiding-places, and to ascertain who in the
border free States would be willing to befriend and
aid him, when he should have succeeded—if he should
succeed—in escaping with his <hi rend="italics">protégées</hi> from the slave
States. At Cincinnati, he met with devoted friends,
who appreciated all the hazards of the attempt. But
he soon ascertained that his perils would be far from
being at an end when he should have got, on his return,
beyond the limits of Kentucky. Indeed, when
he entered the slave States, it was under the impression 
that the chief hazard of the undertaking, as the
result most fearfully proved, would be encountered in
the bordering free States. In seeking to provide
places of refuge in Illinois and Indiana, he found the
southern boundaries of these States, free as they claim
<pb id="pickard285" n="285"/>
to be, infested with men thirsting for the rewards
offered to those who are willing to cast aside their
humanity, and do the work of bloodhounds—hunting
the outcast, and seeking and dragging back the fugitive.
‘Searching the country opposite Paducah, Ky., 
I found,’ he wrote, in a letter dated Eastport. Miss.,
Feb. 3d, ‘the whole country, fifty miles around, is
inhabited by Christian wolves. It is customary, when
a strange negro is seen, for any white man to seize
him, and convey him through and out of the 
State of Illinois to Paducah, and lodge such stranger in Paducah
jail, and then claim such reward as may be offered
by the master.’</p>
          <p>“Failing in the attempt to secure friends on the
borders of Illinois, to meet him upon his return, yet,
trusting, nevertheless, to his own address, and to a
good Providence, he crossed to Paducah, and took a
steamboat on the Tennessee river for South Florence,
the final point of his journey. This was a little town,
four hundred miles up the river, containing about
twenty families, and a post-office, <hi rend="italics">but no school!</hi>”</p>
          <p>This place he reached on the twenty-eighth of January,
having been four days coming up the Tennessee.</p>
          <p>Soon after his arrival at South Florence, Concklin
made his way to the plantation of Mr. McKiernan,
and succeeded in obtaining an interview with Vina.
It was a cold, dark night. Trembling, the faithful
wife went forth form her cabin to the place where it
had been intimated to her she should hear from her
husband. Every few steps she stopped and listened,
for fear some curious neighbor had watched her exit,
<pb id="pickard286" n="286"/>
and would follow her, or—what was worse—report
her absence to the overseer. And then she grew 
afraid to venture forward, lest some trap were laid for 
her unwary feet.</p>
          <p>At last, however, the thought of Peter, and the hope of
hearing of his welfare, conquered all her fears, and she
walked on. Soon she discerned a figure at a little distance,
but the darkness was so intense that she could not tell
whether it was friend or foe. She paused. “Is your name
Vina?” said a strange voice.</p>
          <p>“Yes, sir,” she whispered.</p>
          <p>“Are you Peter Friedman's wife?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, sir, I's his wife.”</p>
          <p>“How would you like to go to him?”</p>
          <p>“I'd like it mons's well, sir, if I could git thar.”</p>
          <p>“Well, I have come on purpose to take you to see him.
Do you believe me?”</p>
          <p>“I don't know, sir.”</p>
          <p>“Can you see me, so as to know me if you should meet
me again?”</p>
          <p>“No, sir, it's so dark; I can't see your face good.”</p>
          <p>He held up one hand. “Do you see my hand?” </p>
          <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
          <p>“Well, if you see me again, you will know me by that
hand. You see that half the forefinger is cut off?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
          <p>“Do you believe that I came from Peter?”</p>
          <p>“I don't know, sir.”</p>
          <p>He drew forth from his pocket the gingham cape which
Peter had given him as a sign. She could see its form, and
she recognized it in a moment. That moment her doubts of
his sincerity were gone.</p>
          <p>Yet she hesitated. She well knew the difficulties
<pb id="pickard287" n="287"/>
and dangers that would attend an effort to escape;
especially when a family of four should make the attempt
together; and nothing but her deep love for her husband,
and her faith in his discretion could have tempted her to
dare it. “But,” thought she, “he never, would 'a'sent a man
'way here to help as if he didn't think we mought git off.
Leastways we'll try. He knows best what we can do, for he's
done took the journey twice.”</p>
          <p>“When does you want us to go?” said she aloud.</p>
          <p>“Just as soon as you can get ready. How long will it
take you, do you think?”</p>
          <p>“I don't know, Sir. I don't believe we could git ready
short o' four weeks.”</p>
          <p>“Well, I can wait. I must go back to Louisville to do
some business before I take you on. But I want first to see
the boys, where are they?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, they're off on the Island, they won't come home
'fore Saturday night.”</p>
          <p>“Well, you tell them to come down to the landing on
Sunday. I will be there walking about, and if I see two
young men, I will keep this hand in sight. You describe it
to them, that they will know me. Now, good bye. Don't be
afraid. I will do all I can for you, but you must help
yourselves.”</p>
          <p>Vina returned to her cabin. Her heart was full. One
moment the hope was strong within her that they should
all escape in safety. She saw the face of her husband, she
listened to his voice; again she heard the fierce pursuer on
her track, and felt herself dragged back to meet a tenfold
darker doom than she had yet encountered. “<hi rend="italics">I couldn'
b'ar,</hi>” she says, “<hi rend="italics">the idea of totin' a scabby back from
one year to another</hi>, and sometimes
<pb id="pickard288" n="288"/>
'peard like I couldn't tell whether to go or not.
One mind say, yes, and t'other mind say, no, but at 
last I des' thought I would start, any how, whether I
prevailed or not.</p>
          <p>The next Sunday, Peter and Levin walked down
towards the river, and when about half-way to the
landing, they met a stranger. He were an old pair of
low quarter shoes without stockings, and his pantaloons
were rolled up half-way to the knee. Altogether his
appearance was that of the “poor white men,” who
inhabit the mountainous districts back of the rich plantations. 
As he approached they noticed the mutilated
finger, but they did not speak, they would not appear
too hasty.</p>
          <p>The stranger stopped. “Do you know me?” said he.</p>
          <p>“No, Sir.”</p>
          <p>“Did you ever see me before?”</p>
          <p>“No, Sir.”</p>
          <p>“Your name is Peter, is it not?” said he, addressing the
oldest.</p>
          <p>“Yes, Sir.”</p>
          <p>“And yours is Levin?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Sir, but how did you a know it?”</p>
          <p>“I know you by your resemblance to your father.”</p>
          <p>“Where did you see our father?”</p>
          <p>“I saw him only once, in Philadelphia.”</p>
          <p>They then turned aside into the woods, and there,
seated upon a log, they held a long consultation
concerning the best means of escape. Concklin told them
all his plans, and listened patiently to their suggestions, 
and then, lest some wanderer in the woods should discover
them in council, they separated.</p>
          <p>The next Wednesday the stranger left the neighborhood
<pb id="pickard289" n="289"/>
on board the boat for Louisville. On the same boat
Mr. McKiernan started for his usual annual visit to New
Orleans; but as Concklin appeared in humble garb, and
neither drank nor gambled, he came into no contact with
the planter.</p>
          <p>This trip down the Tennessee confirmed Concklin in the
opinion he had already formed—that it would be unsafe to
depend upon escaping with his poor helpless friends upon
a steamboat. He procured a skiff, and early in March he
returned, having made all possible arrangements for their
speedy transport beyond the bounds of slavery's domain.</p>
          <p>For two weeks he was obliged to wait for them to
complete their preparations, or rather, for an opportunity
for the whole family to leave the place without exciting
suspicion. At last, on Saturday night, the boys obtained of
the overseer passes to go to South Florence
on Sunday, to buy sugar and coffee for their mother. Vina
and her daughter also procured passes to go to Mrs.
Jackson's, a few miles distant, where they were
to remain until the boys returned. They asked for the
passes at night in order , as they said, that they might
start <hi rend="italics">soon</hi> in the morning, and get to Mrs. Jackson's before
breakfast.</p>
          <p>When all was still throughout the quarter—and it seemed
that night as though some of the people never would go to
bed,” the little family went out into the night. Vina locked
the door, and gave the key to a young girl named Susanna,
desiring her to go in and Prepare supper for them the next
evening.</p>
          <p>The mother and her children walked away in silence,
and at first with stealthy steps. Their hearts quaked with
fear, but they had gone too far to recede. Choking
<pb id="pickard290" n="290"/>
down the sobs that strove to break the midnight
silence, they pressed each other's hands to renew their
courage, and hastened on.</p>
          <p>The clear sky hovered lovingly over the trembling
fugitives, the stars, all silent, shone upon their pathway;
but they saw neither sky nor stars, one faint dim hope
beamed on them from afar, but the thick clouds of terror
often obscured its light.</p>
          <p>With timid steps they approached the river, and walking
along the bank, they soon descried the skiff. Levin
whistled. No answer. Could it be that Concklin had
disappointed them?</p>
          <p>They turned and walked down the stream thinking
perhaps he had gone in search of them. “Thar!” said the
mother, “this yer jaunt's a gwine to turn out bad, for
nobody has good luck when they turns back after started
on a long journey.” Failing to perceive the object of their
search in this direction, they returned to the skiff, and
stooping down, saw Concklin lying fast asleep in the
bottom. He had waited for them till he was weary, and
Levin's timid whistle had failed to waken him from his first
sound slumber.</p>
          <p>It was now nearly three o'clock, and entering the skiff,
they hastened off. The two boys, as well as Conklin, knew
how to use the oars with skill and power, and they fairly
flew over the water.</p>
          <p>At daylight they passed Eastport, distant about forty
miles from Bainbridge Landing. Just below that town they
met a steamboat, but by the direction of a kind Providence, 
she kept on the south side of a small island in the
river, while Concklin guided his skiff towards the north
bank, and thus they escaped the notice of the crew. Upon
that boat was Mr. McKiernan, 
<pb id="pickard291" n="291"/>
then on his return from Louisiana; and had the skiff
been noticed, he might easily have recognized the two
boys, who were both at the oars.</p>
          <p>“During Sunday,” wrote Concklin to a friend, “we
were hailed once by half a dozen men on shore, to
know where we were from, where going,&amp;c. There
being a strong head-wind, I appeared as if I could not
hear them. I know not what they would have done
if they had had a good skiff. Several parties of men
gazed at us along the river. I had previously informed
myself of the scarcity of good skiffs on the Tennessee
river, on which thing alone rested a part of my safety.
I stood at the helm whenever we were in sight of anybody, 
keeping Levin and Peter at the oars. At all
other times, and during the nights, I was principally at
the oars. In the daytime I caused Vina and Catharine
to lie under the blankets, so as not to be seen. They
had a hard time of it. Having a strong head-wind, the
water dashed into the boat, so as to keep the blankets
all the time wet. Peter and Levin got sleepy Sunday
evening, and were so by times all the way through.</p>
          <p>“At five o'clock, Monday evening, for the first time, I
lay down under a blanket, when the boys said two men
were calling to us in a skiff near the shore, and coming
towards us. I ordered that no effort should be made to run.
The two men came alongside, eagerly demanding where
they were going, and ‘whar from? Are you all black men
a'board?’ My boys replied in Southern phrase, ‘White
Massa lyin' thar, sir.<corr>’</corr> When
I arose on my knees, partly throwing off my blanket, and
staring my assailants in the face, they bowed, with ‘How
de do, sir.’ I returned the compliment. They demanded
where I was going, and from whence I came.
<pb id="pickard292" n="292"/>
I dignifiedly replied, ‘To Paducah, and from Eastport.’
They bowed, gave my boat a scrutinizing look, and retired.</p>
          <p>“During Monday night a squall of wind came near
dashing our craft to pieces against the large trees, but by
good management I succeeded in getting between the
trees to the shore, and there remained one hour before we
could start. Arrived on the Ohio at sunrise Tuesday
morning—fifty-one hours time. It should have been done,—
under favorable circumstances in thirty-six hours. The
current of the Tennessee is very stiff. On the Ohio I
intended to travel exclusively at nights. Circumstances
were against me, and I was compelled to travel as much by
day as by night. One half of two nights it was so dark, that
I could not navigate. My crew murmured in consequence
of the hardships. They did not seem to understand that
they were to work for themselves and for their lives. I had
no fair wind from the time I started till I arrived at Harmony.
It would be impossible to describe the difficulties I have
encountered.”</p>
          <p>At ten o'clock on Sunday morning March 23d, they
landed at New Harmony, Ia. Seven days they had rowed
in that frail skiff, exposed each moment to the danger of
discovery and seizure by some one of Slavery's numerous
spies. Seven nights had chilled their limbs, and well nigh
exhausted their energies, both of mind and body, for
except the mother, they were all unused to patient labors.
Theirs had been years of toil without an object, and they
were at this time scarcely capable of self-imposed
endurance of fatigue.</p>
          <p>Now, although their feet pressed the soil of a Free State,
their perils were not passed, and they pursued
<pb id="pickard293" n="293"/>
their way on foot towards the North with anxious hearts.</p>
          <p>Concklin, who had assumed the name of Miller, had
doffed the shabby garb which he had worn before, and
now appeared neatly and comfortably clad. The boys wore
pants of Kentucky jean and black cloth coats, while Vina
and her daughter in their plaid shawls and comfortable
hoods would scarcely have been recognized, even by
those who had often seen them at their labor, as field
hands from McKiernan's place.</p>
          <p>All day they travelled on the public road; and though
they “met a heap of people,” they were not questioned.
There was nothing, indeed, in their appearance 
to excite remark, except that they were dark
in hue and journeying towards the North. At night 
they reached the house of a <hi rend="italics">friend</hi>, where they were
received most kindly. A bountiful supper was quickly
prepared for them, and they soon lay down to peaceful
slumbers. All the next day, too, they rested, for in their
future journeyings, it was deemed wisest to
accept the friendly guidance of the stars.</p>
          <p>After supper on Monday night came another <hi rend="italics">friend</hi> to
carry them northward to his home. He brought two horses
which the women rode; while himself and Concklin, with
the two re-animated brothers, walked beside them. At three
o'clock on Tuesday morning they reached their second
resting place, where they remained till Wednesday night.
They then resumed
their journey, and travelled all night on foot. Cheerfully
they walked along, for every hour their hope became
stronger as their old master's success in overtaking them
grew more and more improbable. At late breakfast time on
Thursday they reached another
<pb id="pickard294" n="294"/>
<hi rend="italics">station</hi>, where they rested till Friday morning. They were
then so far from the river that Concklin thought they might
venture to travel in the day-time, so he proposed to
continue their journey. But Vina had awaked that morning
with a burdened spirit. She “had bad dreams all night,” and
she feared to start by daylight. “'Pears like,” said she,
“something will happen if we starts to-day. You can do as
you likes, sir, but if I was you, I'd put off this yer jaunt till
night. 'Pears like 'taint safe, no how.” But Concklin was
naturally hopeful and bold, and the presentiments of the
ignorant slave woman he regarded as mere idle
superstition. They were so nearly out of danger, that he felt
extremely anxious to push on.</p>
          <p>Vina started with reluctance. The kind friend at whose
house they were, lent her a horse for a few miles, and sent
his son to ride the animal back. Soon the rain began to fall,
and all day long “it rained constant.” All day, too, they
journeyed on, for they dared not stop where they were not
sure of finding friends.</p>
          <p>Late in the afternoon, as with dripping umbrellas and
weary feet they walked along, a spotted horse which had
escaped from a field by the road side, came galloping
before them. His owner called upon the travellers to stop
him, but Vina, in a low tone, bade the boys go on. Peter,
however, naturally obliging, caught the horse, and
delivered him to his owner. A little further on they passed
a saw-mill, in front of which a large man stood gazing at the
little company. “How d'y', Aunt Lucy,” cried he, “which
way are, you travelling?” No answer was given as they
hastened on, but their hearts beat quick with fear.</p>
          <pb id="pickard295" n="295"/>
          <p>Just before night they approached the dwelling of the
<hi rend="italics">friend</hi> where they were next to rest. His son lived in a small
house close, by, and here Concklin bade them “run in out
of the rain,” while he went on to the main station to
announce their coming.</p>
          <p>They obeyed, and soon they were all seated beside a
cheerful fire. The bright blaze imparted new life to
their chilled and weary limbs; and from their hearts
ascended a silent thanksgiving to Him who had brought
them safely to the end of this day's journey,—when
suddenly the sound of many horses' feet was heard.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head>
          <head>THE CAPTURE.</head>
          <p>ONE glance at the window sent a shudder through the
little party—for there, halting at the gate, were seven men on
horseback.</p>
          <p>“They done come after us;” hoarsely whispered one of
the boys.</p>
          <p>“Yes,” answered their mother, “I'll lay anything we're
gwine to be tooken now.”</p>
          <p>The men dismounted and tied their horses to the fence.
Foremost was <hi rend="italics">the owner of the spotted horse</hi>, upon the
very animal which Peter had delivered into his hand, and
next was he who had accosted “<hi rend="italics">Aunt Lucy</hi>” but an hour or
two before.</p>
          <p>What to do the helpless creatures did not know.
Concklin was away. Oh! why did he leave them?
The house was small, and the only place of egress
they could discover was the door by which they had
just entered, and this their foes were even then approaching.
They saw no place to hide, and the young man
and woman, whose house they had so recently entered,
stood petrified with amazement, and gazed upon the
scene.</p>
          <p>The seven men entered the little dwelling. Three or four
of them remained near the door, while the others advanced
into the middle of the room and opened a 
<pb id="pickard297" n="297"/>
conversation with the boys. The heart beat wildly beneath
each dark-hued breast, but they strove to look indifferent
while they replied to the questioners as they had been
previously instructed.</p>
          <p>“Where are you going?”</p>
          <p>“To Springfield, Sir.”</p>
          <p> “Do you belong to the man that brought you here?”</p>
          <p> “Yes, Sir.”</p>
          <p>“Where did you come from?”</p>
          <p>“From Kaintucky, Sir. Mass'r died last year, and left us
to his brother, and now he's a takin' us on to his farm.”</p>
          <p>“What did he bring you through here for? Did n't he
know that it was against the law?”</p>
          <p>“Don't know, Sir, reckon he 'lowed 'twas right.”</p>
          <p>“I'll be d—d if I don't believe he stole you all.”</p>
          <p>The brave seven then stood aside and consulted for a
few minutes, and then one of their number went out.
Soon he returned with a half-gallon jug of liquor, and a
wagon. The besieging party then took a drink all round to
raise their courage. They offered, too, to
treat Levin and Peter, but the boys declined the honor.</p>
          <p>Another brief consultation was held, and then,
producing ropes, these zealous priests of the Moloch of
Slavery, proceeded to bind their victims for the sacrifice.
How the boys longed to resist !—but they were
all unarmed, while their assailants carried both bowie-knives 
and pistols. Besides, their host, who stood
silent by, would, for aught they knew, join with their
enemies against them. It would be idle to attempt to
fight against such fearful odds; so they stood still while
their hands were tied behind them, and then, obeying
<pb id="pickard298" n="298"/>
the orders of the foreman of the band, they climbed into
the wagon.</p>
          <p>The women followed in silence. Despair was written on
their faces, but their captors had no pity for their helpless
woe. The coarse jest, and the blasphemous oath went
round, while now and then a burst of boisterous laughter
came from the “<hi rend="italics">law-abiding</hi>” band that guarded their
return towards the “land of chivalry.”</p>
          <p>When they had proceeded a short distance, Concklin
came running after them. Oh! that he had never left them!
then had they been safe. He sprang into the wagon, and
commenced untying the captives. But he was soon
discovered by the ruffians in attendance, who, pointing
their pistols at his head, swore that they would blow out
his brains if he did not desist.</p>
          <p>He remained in the wagon, however, until they reached
the jail at Vincennes. It was very late. The lights were
extinguished in all the houses, and the jailor was asleep.
“Ho! Hallo!” cried the leader of the band.</p>
          <p>The jailor at length appeared.</p>
          <p>“Do you want some more stock ?”</p>
          <p>“I don't know; that depends on what sort it is.”</p>
          <p>“Well, its a sort you've not had here lately. Take them
in; they're tired, and want to go to bed.”</p>
          <p>The jailor held up his light and took a survey of the
captives. “Well,” said he, “if they're tired, I don't think
they're sleepy; say, are you sleepy, old woman?”</p>
          <p>“No, Sir,” replied Vina, “I don't feel like sleepin'.”</p>
          <p>“So I thought; I should'nt if I were in your
place.”</p>
          <p>After some further conversation with the chief of
<pb id="pickard299" n="299"/>
the band, he took the prisoners in and locked them up 
“But he acted,” Vina says, “like he felt mighty sorry for us;
and I believe, if we had'nt been watched so close, he
mought 'a' let us go.”</p>
          <p>In the jail they were visited every day by Concklin, who
came and talked with them through the window; and daily
Vina begged him to leave them there and seek his own
safety. “Now you can't do us no good, Sir, no how, and
'pears like you best take care o'youself.”</p>
          <p>“Oh,” replied he, “I don't feel at all uneasy.”</p>
          <p>“Well, Sir, I feels oneasy about you, and you best not
stay round yer no longer. It wont make it no better for us,
and you'll git into trouble, sure.”</p>
          <p>But some dream of rescuing them haunted his mind;
he could not bear to leave them. It was something
new for him to be foiled in any undertaking; and he
had set his heart upon delivering this family to the
husband and father, who he know was waiting, with
trembling heart, to welcome them.</p>
          <p>Immediately after lodging them in jail, the chief of
the marauding band had telegraphed in all directions
to ascertain if four negroes, answering the description
of these had anywhere been missed; and also what
reward was offered for their capture. The “lightning
postboy” hasted to execute their mission, and soon
returned them answer. “Four likely negroes had
been stolen from Bernard McKiernan, near South Florence, Ala., 
and their owner had offered a reward of
four hundred dollars for the property, and six hundred
for the apprehension of the thief; and his delivery in
South Florence.”</p>
          <pb id="pickard300" n="300"/>
          <p>Upon the receipt of this information, Concklin was
seized, and thrust into prison. Still his brave hopeful spirit
bore him up—“'peared like he couldn't feel discouraged.”</p>
          <p>It was night; and night in prison is never lovely.
Catharine and her brothers were asleep, but Vina's eyes
closed not. Her thoughts were busy picturing the sorrows
to which they were returning, the tortures that awaited
them, and all the hopelessness of their future lives. Never
more should the voice of her husband greet her ear—never
more should his smiles gladden her heart. And her children—
henceforth they would be branded as runaways, and thus
exposed to grievous ills, to which, thus far, they had been
strangers. No one would trust them now.</p>
          <p>Suddenly she started. Wheels approached, and stopped
in front of the jail. Did she know that voice? Yes, she could
not be mistaken.</p>
          <p>“I wish you would let me in. I would like to see them.”</p>
          <p>She heard the jailor in reply, and soon footsteps
approached their cell. Vina roused her children. “We'll git
toted back now. Old McKiernan's a comin.' He's a talkin' out
yer.”</p>
          <p>Soon the key turned in the lock, and the jailor entered
with a light, followed by a stranger, and the “old master.”
His cane was in his hand—his face
looked redder than usual, and his eyes hastily searched
every part of the room. He approached the bed on 
which his slaves were still lying,
and for a moment looked down on them in silence.</p>
          <p>“Ha! boy, what are you doing here?” said he to
Peter.</p>
          <pb id="pickard301" n="301"/>
          <p>No answer.</p>
          <p>“Speak! you rascal, or I'll knock you in the head with this
stick. Don't you know me?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
          <p>“Aint I your old master?”</p>
          <p>Reluctantly Peter answered, “Yes, sir.”</p>
          <p>“Didn't I raise you all?”</p>
          <p> “Yes, sir.”</p>
          <p>“Well, d—n you, what are you doing here?”</p>
          <p>“Don't know, sir.”</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Don't know!</hi> I'll make you tell a different tale from that
when I get you home. You, Levin, don't you think this, is a
devil of a caper?”</p>
          <p>Levin was silent, and the master turned to his mother.
“See here, girl, how came you to leave home?”</p>
          <p>No answer.</p>
          <p>“Aint it d—d astonishing you all can't answer when
you're spoken to?”</p>
          <p>Still no answer came, and he turned to his companion. 
“Ah, that huzzy! she's at the bottom of all
this. If it hadn't been for her, and that rascal Peter, they
never would have left me in the world.”</p>
          <p>“What Peter is that?” asked the man.</p>
          <p>“Why, he is this girl's husband. He got in with a Jew,
and persuaded him to buy him; and a few months after
that, Peter bought himself. This scrape was in the bargain
at first, I'm certain.”</p>
          <p>“Where are this Peter and his master now?”</p>
          <p>“I don't know exactly—but if they ever show their heads
in Tuscumbia again, I'll have them hung sky
high. Peter is at the bottom of this; but he never had sense
to do it alone—he's had help, I'll swear. Some d—d abolitionist
has had a hand in it. I believe there's
<pb id="pickard302" n="302"/>
some, of them in Franklin county, and if I can hunt them
out, they shall be burnt, or I'll have their heads—one.”</p>
          <p>He then proceeded to question the family concerning
their escape; and to shield Concklin, they told a story
which they had previously prepared for an emergency like
this. They declared that Concklin, or as they called him,
Miller, did not bring them away at first, but that four
persons took them, and delivered them up to him. Who
these persons were, they could not tell; but they described
“<hi rend="italics">some sort o' men that they had never seen.</hi>” “Yes, yes,”
said the master, “d—n them, <hi rend="italics">I've seen four such looking
fellows in Tuscumbia.</hi>”</p>
          <p>After a while he left them, and went into the next room,
where Concklin was confined. There they heard his voice
for a long time; at first in moderate tones, but when his
passion rose, his words could easily be distinguished. 
“It's d—d astonishing that you won't tell who started you
in this business. Would you be such a fool as to be carried
back in irons, and lose your life for the sake of saving
other people?”</p>
          <p>“It is of no use for you to question me about them,”
replied Concklin. “You have me now, and it is not worth
while to bring other people into trouble.”</p>
          <p>“Well, d—n you, how do you feel in them irons?”</p>
          <p>“I suppose I feel better than you will at some future
day in consequence of causing them to be put on me.”</p>
          <p> “How is that?”</p>
          <p>“You will have plenty of time to find out.”</p>
          <p>Finding that he could get no satisfactory answer from
the “<hi rend="italics">thief,</hi>” he returned to the room where his property
was confined. Here he remained about an
<pb id="pickard303" n="303"/>
hour, alternately cursing and asking questions; but he
could not make them tell who started them on their 
way. At last he left them and went out.</p>
          <p>Early in the morning, he returned, and ordered them to
get ready to go home. They rose immediately, but were
scarcely ready when the stage came to the door.</p>
          <p>After they were seated in the coach, Concklin was
brought out in irons, and put in with them. He still looked
brave and cheerful; but the slaves, alas! there was no light
in-their downcast eyes—no hope in their disappointed
hearts.</p>
          <p>When the stage stopped to change horses, they
alighted to take breakfast. They, all sat down together, but
only the master and his companion<ref targOrder="U" id="ref8" n="8" rend="sc" target="note8">* </ref>
<note id="note8" n="8" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref8"><p>* Emison. See Memoir of Concklin.</p></note>
 had appetites for
food. Vina only drank a cup of coffee, and the boys ate
very little.</p>
          <p>“Why don't you eat, girl?” demanded the master.</p>
          <p>“I don't keer 'bout eatin',” she replied.</p>
          <p>“Well, if you all had staid at home, you'd been able to
eat.”</p>
          <p>They were soon re-seated in the stage, and none of them
left it again till after dark, when they reached Evansville.
Here they spoke of putting the captives into jail for safe
keeping; but it was whispered that if they did so they might
not find them in the morning; and at last they took them to
a private house, where, after giving them their supper,
they locked them up all together in a room in the second
story. The master of the house, who, they understood was
a brother-in-law of their master's escort, sat all night on the
stairs to watch them.</p>
          <pb id="pickard304" n="304"/>
          <p>Concklin had now become alarmed, and during the night
he was much excited. He tried the windows of the room,
and was about to jump from one of them, when Vina
interposed. “Oh!” said she, “don't go out thar'. You'll be
dashed to pieces, sir, jumpin' out o' that ar high winder. Oh!
if you had tuck my advice, and run off when they first
cotch us, you'd 'a' been safe now, and it would n't 'a' been
no worse for us.”</p>
          <p>This was a gloomy night. None of the prisoners felt
inclined to sleep. Liberty—the precious goal which they had
almost grasped, was now beyond their reach—forever lost.
“Well chillern,” said the mother, “you all's got to cotch it now.
You wont be the best hands on the place no more, and
everything 'at's done wrong 'll be laid to you. But it can't be
<hi rend="italics">hoped</hi>—we's done the best we could, and now the Lord's all
the friend we got.”</p>
          <p>Morning dawned at last, and after an early breakfast,
Mr. McKiernan came with his attendant, Emison, to
conduct them to the boat.</p>
          <p>How the sinews of, Levin and Peter ached for a race! If
their mother and sister had been safe, would they have
walked quietly down to the river, on whose bosom they
were to be borne back to slavery? No, no—they would at
least have made one, desperate effort to escape. But they
could not desert those who were so dear to them; and so
they meekly followed their old master, while they knew his
footsteps led to the scene of cruel torture—perhaps even
to death.</p>
          <p>Once on board the boat—the “Paul Anderson,” the
negroes were deemed safe; still, whenever the boat landed
they were closely watched. Concklin was kept
<pb id="pickard305" n="305"/>
confined in a state-room, where his poor friends had no
chance to speak to him. They lay at night upon the cabin
floor, and <hi rend="italics">the young people</hi> slept. Their mother, too, several
times grew drowsy, but the horrid dreams that came soon
frightened sleep away. She heard every footstep; and
towards morning, they were all aroused by people hurrying
to and fro with lights, and calling to each other in every
direction. The master came to Vina. “Where are the
boys?” said he.</p>
          <p>“Yon they lie, sir.”</p>
          <p>“Well, that rascal's gone.”</p>
          <p>“Is he?” Such was her only answer; but her heart beat
quick with the hope that he had by some means, escaped
in safety. The boat was searched in every part, but no
trace of him was found.</p>
          <p>Early in the morning, Mr. McKiernan, with his property,
landed at Paducah, to wait for the “Greek Slave,” which
was expected to pass that day on her home trip from
Louisville.</p>
          <p>The mistress of the hotel where they stopped, took a
great interest in the returning fugitives, and begged Mr.
McKiernan to sell her the old woman and her daughter. He
did not, however, seem anxious to dispose of them.</p>
          <p>“How would you like to live with me?” said the lady
herself to Vina.</p>
          <p>“I don't know, ma'am; you mought be hard to
please. I've had one hard missus, and I don't care, 'bout
changin' for a worse one.”</p>
          <p>“Well,” said the lady, “I give you my word, I would be
kind to you. You may ask any of my servants
if I am hard to be suited.”</p>
          <pb id="pickard306" n="306"/>
          <p>But the old master listened with impatience to all her
arguments. “I <hi rend="italics">raised</hi> this family myself,” said he, “and
even if there is danger of their running off again, I may as
well hold bad property as anybody else.”</p>
          <p>Such was his usual feeling whenever any one proposed 
to purchase one of his people. He disliked to
part with them; not because he loved them—for we
have seen that his heart knew no pity for their sufferings; 
but <hi rend="italics">they were his</hi>, and he would rather buy than
sell.</p>
          <p>At about ten o'clock in the morning, the “Greek Slave”
appeared, and the melancholy company were
soon ascending the Tennessee. The lonely quiet banks
looked gloomy to them now, notwithstanding the trees
were clothed in their freshest green, and wild flowers of
every form and hue were nodding to their lovely images in
the bright water. There was no Spring-time in their hearts.
Darkness, like the shadow of Death, hung over their spirits,
while the bright sunshine and the glad notes of a thousand
birds but mocked their misery.</p>

          <head>PETER PLANS TO REDEEM HIS FAMILY.</head>
          <p>As soon as Mr. Concklin left Philadelphia, Peter
returned to his mother's house, and there remained,
restless and anxious, for many weeks. At last his brother
William, who had received a letter from Concklin, dated
Princeton, Ia., March 24th, wrote to him that his family had
arrived in a Free State. Immediately he hastened to
Philadelphia, his heart swelling with the hope of soon
embracing them; but the day after his arrival, alas! these
glorious visions of approaching joy suddenly faded away.</p>
          <p>“O, Peter,<corr>”</corr> said his sister Mary, as he entered the room
where she was sitting, “have you heard the news?”</p>
          <p>He noticed that her voice trembled, and that her eyes
were filled with tears; and his heart interpreted but too
faithfully her emotion. Still he answered calmly, “No.”</p>
          <p>“Sit down,” said she, “and I will read it to you.” She
had the “Ledger” in her hand, and she read several
extracts from Indiana papers, giving an account of the
seizure of four slaves who had escaped from Bernard
McKiernan, of South Florence, Ala., and also of a
white man, calling himself Miller, who had them in charge.</p>
          <pb id="pickard308" n="308"/>
          <p>Peter listened in silence. “It is just what I expected,” said
he in a hoarse voice, when she had finished, “just what I
told them all. Oh! if they had heard to me!<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>For a time he seemed discouraged. His thoughts
followed the trembling fugitives on their return, and under
every torture which he had been accustomed to see
inflicted upon runaways, he fancied that his dear wife and
children, even then, were groaning.</p>
          <p>A boy belonging to a <hi rend="italics">pious</hi> man, near Tuscumbia—   
a class leader in the Methodist Church—was, at the
time Peter came away, wearing a heavy iron collar
upon his neck, and a band of the same metal around
his body. A rod of iron was welded to each of these
upon his back, and extended further above his head
than his hands could reach. Rods of iron were also
fastened to the collar on each side, and at the point of
each shoulder they were bent up, and reached higher
than his head. To the highest of these rods a bell
was fastened, which tinkled constantly. In the morning 
the boy was locked to the plough by a chain
which was fastened to the band around his body, and
thus he was obliged to plough till noon. The head-man 
then unlocked the chain, and led the mule away;
leaving his fellow-slave to follow to the house. All
the long afternoon he was forced to plough in the same
manner; and at night, the head-man locked him in a
cabin alone, and left him to cook his scanty supper
and to get what rest his torturing irons would allow.
For several months he had already worn these cruel
badges of the runaway—and now the father shuddered,
as in imagination he saw his own beloved sons enduring 
similar punishments.</p>
          <pb id="pickard309" n="309"/>
          <p>Another man, belonging to Mr. B—, of Tuscumbia,
died not long before Peter left that town, from wearing an
iron collar in hot weather. It rubbed the skin off the poor
fellow's neck, but his master swore he should wear it till he
died. Soon was his threat fulfilled, for the flesh mortified
under the heated iron, and when the sufferer uttered his
last groan, the inhuman instrument was still upon his neck.</p>
          <p>He knew also that even the women on McKiernan's
place had learned to wear the irons. Well he remembered
Marv—a beautiful woman, and a special favorite with her
master, as all the pretty women were. She had received so
much abuse from her mistress that her life was hateful to
her, and at last she resolved to escape, for a time at least,
from her persecutions. Accordingly she fled to the woods.
The next Sunday morning the order was issued that no
allowance should be given out till all the hands had been
out to hunt Mary. Peter was there that day visiting his
family, and as Vina was obliged to go, he joined the hunt,
well knowing that such a course would gratify the master.
They soon found her track, with here and there traces of
corn and onions which had appeased her hunger. But few
of the slaves, however, had any desire to find her, and
those few were easily sent by the others in a wrong
direction. When night came, therefore, Mary had not been
taken. All day they had rambled in the woods—fasting— 
except that some had now and then seized a roasting ear as
they passed by a field of corn; they were delighted
therefore, when, as the shades of night approached, they
were suffered to go home, and to receive their week's
allowance.</p>
          <pb id="pickard310" n="310"/>
          <p>But notwithstanding the failure of this day's hunt, the
search for Mary was at divers times repeated, and after
having spent three or four months in the woods, she was
brought in. Then came the punishment for her heinous
crime. First, her master gave her a cruel beating, and then
the overseer inflicted upon her naked back a like “correction ;” 
and after that, for a long time, she was daily
stripped and beaten by her mistress's orders. This system
was continued until she became so weak that they feared
she would be “<hi rend="italics">ruined,</hi>” and then the irons were brought in
requisition. The collar was welded on her slender neck, and
a heavy band of iron upon her ankle. To this latter, one
end of a heavy log-chain was attached, the other end of
which was brought up and locked round her waist. Month
after month was the poor woman forced to wear these
galling irons. Peter, himself, had often seen her coming from
the field at night, “lookin' every minute like she would drop
down to the ground with the weight of her shackles. She
was raggetty and dirty too, for she hadn't no spirit left to
wash and mend her clothes.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref9" n="9" rend="sc" target="note9">* </ref>
<note id="note9" n="9" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref9"><p>* Vina says, “Mary done took so much whippin' that the
flesh between her shoulders inflames nigh 'bout every
year, and the skin looks like a dry brown crust. Then they
has to send for the doctor, and he takes out a strip o' flesh
five or six inches long. After a while her back heals up
again, and she gits well enough to work. They done quit
'busin' her now, and she works all the time in the field, 'cept
they has a heap o' company,' or there's some great hurry o'
sewin' gwine on. Then they brings her in for she's a elegant
seamster, and understands all sorts o' house service.”</p></note>
” The image of this tortured
woman would rise before him now—the clanking of her
heavy chain would rack his ears. No wonder that he
<pb id="pickard311" n="311"/>
could not rest. No wonder that all labor and privation
seemed as nothing if he could yet gain the ransom
of his loved ones.</p>
          <p>Peter started immediately for Cincinnati, in the hope of
finding his late master, and obtaining his assistance
in this, his pressing need. But he was disappointed.
Mr. Isaac Friedman was still in Illinois. His brother Levi,
however, warmly espoused his cause, and would have
gone himself to Tuscumbia, to try what could be done for
the relief of the family, had he not been kindly warned that
such a step would be both hazardous and futile. A friend
of his in Franklin county, wrote him that the citizens of
Tuscumbia were highly incensed against both his brother and 
Peter, as in consequence of what the latter had said to Mrs.
McKiernan, concerning Mr. Friedman's partial promise to
buy his family, they regarded them as instigators of the
escape.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref10" n="10" rend="sc" target="note10">* </ref></p>
          <note id="note10" n="10" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref10">
            <p>* That this feeling was not, however, quite universal among
 the citizens is evident from an incident which occurred on board the 
“Greek Slave,” as she lay at Tuscumbia Landing, having on board 
the captured family. “Well, Old Woman,” said a gentleman from 
town, who came on board to see them, “are you sorry for running 
away?” “No, Sir, I don't feel sorry;” replied Vina. “I think 
any person else would 'a' done like I have.” “Yes, that's so,” replied 
he, “I would have done the same thing myself. Peter is a 
good fellow too, and your master is an old rascal. Look here, if he 
takes a notion to sell you all, I'd like to buy you, for I believe 
you're an honest family, and I don't think the less of you for 
this,”  “I can't remember his name,” said Vina, as she related
the incident, “but he spoke mons's kind, and he's as fine looking
a man, nigh 'bout, as ever I see.”</p>
          </note>
          <p>But this did not discourage the anxious husband and
father. He had brought from Philadelphia a letter
<pb id="pickard312" n="312"/>
of introduction to Levi Coffin, a worthy Friend, residing in
Cincinnati. This he delivered, and Mr. Coffin soon made his
case known to several benevolent gentlemen in town. One
of these, Mr. Samuel Lewis, at Peter's request, addressed a
letter to Mr. L. B. Thornton, of Tuscumbia, requesting him
to ascertain from Mr. McKiernan, whether or not he would
sell the family, and at what price he valued them, and
asking him to write the result of his inquiries to William
Still, of Philadelphia. (Mr. Thornton was a young man much
esteemed—a Virginian, who had for some time taught the
boy's school in Tuscumbia, while he pursued his law
studies. Peter had often performed slight services for him,
and always regarded him as one of his best friends.)</p>
          <p>One day during his stay in Cincinnati, as Peter was
standing upon the sidewalk, striving in his own mind to
devise some means to hasten the release from bondage of
those he loved, a pale lady, seated in a carriage, beckoned
him towards her. He approached the carriage, and the lady
asked him if he would like employment, and if he could
drive. He replied in the affirmative, and was soon seated on
the box. For several hours he drove her carriage about the
city, and so kindly did she address him, that at last he told
her all his grief. She listened with much interest to the
story, and after expressing her sympathy with his sorrows,
she told him that her husband was a friend of the
unfortunate, and that perhaps he could assist him in his
efforts to buy his family. She accordingly directed
him to her husband's office, and entering, he found
himself in the presence of Hon. Salmon P. Chase.</p>
          <p>This good man, after hearing his simple tale, readily
<pb id="pickard313" n="313"/>
offered to do anything in his power to aid him. Peter then
told him that to Mr. John Gist, of Kentucky, a brother of
his former master, Mr. McKiernan was largely indebted;
and that as he was an old servant of the family, he thought
it possible that Mr. Gist would be able and willing to assist
him in the purchase of his family. Before he left the office
Mr. Chase wrote a letter to this gentleman, asking for
information with regard to the best plan for getting the
family and also if he could in any way aid the poor man in
his efforts for their purchase.</p>
          <p>From this letter Peter never heard, although he staid in
Cincinnati more than three weeks after it was despatched.</p>
          <p>Towards the last of June he returned with a heavy heart
to his friends in New Jersey. He had done all he could, but
nowhere could he discern a ray of hope. Yet he could not
be idle; and as it seemed useless at that time to attempt
any further steps towards the accomplishment of his one
absorbing wish, he settled himself at service in Burlington,
New Jersey.</p>
          <p>His mistress, Mrs. Mary A. Buckman, treated him with
uniform kindness, and with her aid and that of her two
daughters, he commenced learning to read. We have
before related his resolute attempts to learn the mysteries
of letters during his few visits to the Sabbath School in
Lexington, but that was long—
long years ago, and though he had then mastered the
wondrous alphabet, and even learned to spell a few little
words, he had never, since that time, been able to make
the least advance in erudition, But now when through the
kindness of these ladies, he became able to read, though
but imperfectly, the precious words of 
<pb id="pickard314" n="314"/>
the New Testament, he felt that his arduous efforts to be
free had not been all in vain.</p>
          <p>Sometime in the ensuing August came the following
letter from Mr. McKiernan, to whom Mr. Thornton had
referred the one which had been written to him from
Cincinnati:</p>

          <p>This letter was soon circulated among those friend who
had become interested in accomplishing the re-union
of the family, and so enormous was the price demanded
for the slaves that few persons deemed it possible for
Peter to procure the means to ransom them. But his
<pb id="pickard316" n="316"/>
courage did not falter. He could not live in freedom,
surrounded by his friends, and supplied with every
comfort, and yet make no effort to redeem those he loved
far better than life, <hi rend="italics">or even liberty</hi>, from the cruel bondage
which they endured. But for a time he hesitated as to the
means that would be safest and most speedy in effecting
his purpose. Give it up, he would not—that was settled.</p>
          <p>He thought of going from place to place to solicit aid,
but then he was unknown, and even the benevolent in
heart would hesitate to contribute towards so large a sum,
while they were unacquainted with his previous character.
It would be useless to write to any of his old friends in
Tuscumbia for testimonials concerning the uprightness of
his former life—for there he was believed to have originated
the plan of running off his family, and he knew that
notwithstanding all his years of honest, patient,
persevering toil he was now branded as a <hi rend="italics">negro thief.</hi></p>
          <p>After pondering the subject for some weeks, he
bethought him that after all, he might have a friend in “the
North” who had known his character. He remembered that
one of the young ladies, who had taught in the Seminary at
Tuscumbia, returned home about the time he finished
paying for himself; and he resolved, if possible, to
ascertain her residence. He had heard the teachers, in
conversation with each other, mention New York and
Syracuse, and he believed the latter place had been their
home. Yet he had no certain knowledge, for he had
cautiously refrained from asking any questions about the
North, lest he should be suspected of undue curiosity
respecting the dwelling of the Free. He soon communicated
to his friends
<pb id="pickard317" n="317"/>
his hope of obtaining some testimonials of good character 
from these ladies, if they could be found, and a letter of
inquiry concerning them was immediately written by Mr.
McKim, of Philadelphia, to Rev. S. J. May, of Syracuse.</p>
          <p>This letter was promptly answered, but from some
unknown cause the reply was not received by Peter. So he
quietly continued at his service, performing his regular
duties to the satisfaction of his mistress, though all the
while his mind was racked by alternate hopes and fears.</p>
          <p>Thus passed the winter of 1851-2; but in the spring his
anxiety to <hi rend="italics">do</hi> something for his family became so intense
that he resolved to go out and try his success in collecting
funds for their ransom. He acquainted Mrs. Buckman with
this design, but, just after she had engaged another
servant to take his place, an incident occurred which
revived his hope of finding yet a friend. He heard a
gentleman who was visiting at the house speak of his
home in Syracuse, and he took an opportunity to inquire of
him if he had ever known the ladies of whom he was so
anxious to hear. To his great joy Mr. — knew them both,
and informed him that although one of them still remained
in the South, the other had returned, was married, and
resided a few miles from Syracuse.</p>
          <p>This cheering news Peter communicated to his mistress,
who, at his request, wrote for him to his friend. He now
determined to remain in Burlington until he should receive
an answer to this letter, and accordingly, he entered the
service of Judge Boudinot, one of the principal citizens of
that place.</p>
          <p>About this time the idea occurred to him, that, perhaps,
<pb id="pickard318" n="318"/>
it would be best to buy his wife and daughter first,
and afterwards to try to raise a sum sufficient to purchase
the two boys. He determined at least to learn what chance
of success he would have in case he should obtain the
means to do this; and for assistance in making this inquiry,
he applied to Dr. Ely, of Medford, N. J., who wrote for him a
second letter to Mr. Thornton of Tuscumbia. To this came
in due time the following answer:</p>
          <q type="letter" direct="unspecified">

          <p>The letter written by Mrs. Buckman failed to reach its
destination; and after remaining in Judge Boudinot's
service for five months, Peter resolved to go himself to
Syracuse, and find his friend, if indeed he had one in that
vicinity. If he accomplished this, he would then try his
success in collecting money. He had already saved from his
wages since he had been in Burlington, one hundred
dollars, which he determined should be the first
contribution towards the $5,000.</p>

          <head>“HOW DID HE GET THE MONEY?”</head>
          <p>PETER received from his friends at parting but small
encouragement to hope. The sum required was so
enormous, and the idea of paying gold to him who had
already robbed them of the earnings of long years was so
repugnant to the feelings of the best men, that it seemed
almost useless to attempt to raise the money. A few days
before he started, his brother William said to him, “You
ought not to feel so uneasy—so perfectly restless because
your family are slaves. There are thousands of people as
good as they who are in the same condition. Do you see
that woman across the street? She is just as good as you
are, and she has a mother and sisters in slavery. You
cannot expect people to give you five thousand dollars to
buy your family, when so many others, equally deserving,
are just as badly off.”</p>
          <p>“Look here,” replied Peter, “I know a heap of men, as
<hi rend="italics">good</hi>, and as <hi rend="italics">smart</hi> as
 I am, that are slaves now;
but—<hi rend="italics">I've bought my liberty, and my family 
shall be free.</hi>”</p>
          <p>On the eighth of November, 1852, he left Burlington

when, with a letter to Mr. May, corroborating
such facts in his statement as had come to her knowledge, 
and certifying to his character for truthfulness
and industry while a slave, he returned to Syracuse.</p>
          <p>He was now thoroughly furnished for his arduous
undertaking; and with letters of introduction from Mr.
May to various co-laborers in the work of benevolence, 
he left Syracuse, and journeyed westward.</p>
          <p>His first stop was at Auburn, where a letter from Mr.
May, together with his other papers, and above all,
his modest earnestness of manner, won
him a favorable reception. He visited first the clergymen of
the different churches, to some, of whom he brought
letters; and they commended him to the charity of their
people. Here, in Rev. Mr. Millard's church, on Sunday
evening, he appeared for the first time before the public. 
“I was mighty skeered,” said he, “when Mr. Millard took
me with him into the pulpit, and told me I must stand up,
myself, and tell my story to the people. 'Peared like I
couldn't stand, no how; but I 
<pb id="pickard322" n="322"/>
said a few words, and Mr. Millard, he helped me out; so I
got along mighty well.”</p>
          <p>He remained a week in Auburn, and received while
there fifty dollars. This success encouraged him, and he
went on to Rochester, stopping by the way at Waterloo,
where, also he received some assistance.</p>
          <p>At Rochester he staid two or three weeks, and was
kindly entertained at the houses of worthy citizens, and
about the middle of December he returned to Syracuse
with two hundred dollars. This, Mr. May deposited for him
in the bank, and giving him letters to Messrs. William
Lloyd Garrison, Theodore Parker, T. Starr King, and others,
in Boston, bade him hasten thither, in order to be there
before the Holidays.</p>
          <p>As soon as he had delivered his letters of introduction
from Mr. May, in Boston, he sought Andover, for the
purpose of visiting the Author of “Uncle Tom's Cabin,” to
whom also he had a letter of recommendation. Mrs. Stowe
received him cordially, and after heading his subscription
list in Andover, gave him the following, brief letter, which,
he says “<hi rend="italics">helped him mightily.</hi>”</p>

          <p>At Portland Peter's subscription list was headed by
Hon. Neal Dow; and during the eight days he spent in that
city, he received one hundred dollars. Thence he
proceeded to Brunswick, Bath, Saco, Biddeford;
Portsmouth, N. H.; Hampton, Newburyport and Garretson
Station; and on his return to Boston, about the last of
May, he deposited four hundred and ninety dollars in the
hands of Mr. Loring; making in all nine hundred and fifty
dollars which he had received during the five months he
had spent in New England.</p>
          <p>He now decided to return to New Jersey and to visit
Philadelphia for the purpose of further conference
<pb id="pickard326" n="326"/>
with his friends. As he passed through New York, on his
way thither he presented a letter to Thomas Foulcke of that
city, from Dr. Parrish of Burlington, and though he staid
but a short time, a few friends there presented him seventy-five 
dollars.</p>
          <p>At Burlington he allowed himself a few days rest. He had
been absent seven months, and had visited more than
twenty different towns. His mind had been constantly
excited—the theme of his discourse wherever he went, was
the liberation of his family. He had no doubts concerning
the result. When asked what he would do with the money
he had gained, if after all, he failed to accomplish his object,
his reply was, “'Pears like the Lord wont let me fail.” Such
was his simple, earnest faith, and to this his actions
corresponded. His dress was neat, but strictly economical,
and though he was not mean, yet every dollar he received
was precious.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding his success thus far, his friends in New 
Jersey and Philadelphia had no confidence in his being
able to raise the whole sum demanded by the tyrant; and
Mr. Dillwyn Smith, of Burlington, who from the first, had
taken much interest in his case, wrote for him to his former
mistress, Mrs. Hogun, of Alabama, to solicit her influence
with Mr. McKiernan, in the hope of procuring some
abatement of the price.</p>
          <p>For two weeks Peter waited there for an answer to this
letter, but none arriving, be grew impatient to proceed with
his great work; and once more bidding adieu to his kind
friends, who had, during his stay, presented him forty-five
dollars, he left them and went again to Brooklyn.</p>
          <p>There he spent the fourth of July with his brother
<pb id="pickard327" n="327"/>
John, and then he went to Syracuse, where, in a few days,
he received one hundred and twenty-five dollars. Thence
he went to Peterboro', and spent a night at the home of
Gerritt Smith. He had frequently heard, since he had been
free, of the great wealth of this distinguished friend of Man, 
and he had expected to find him
inhabiting a princely dwelling, abounding in all the luxuries
that gold can buy. But to his astonishment, his residence
was a plain and quiet home, and his manners and style of
living entirely free from pomp and ostentation. Mr. Smith
gave him the following letter, together with a generous
sum for the furtherance of his all-engrossing object.</p>

          <p>In Providence, Peter remained during the month of
November, and on looking at his book, in which were
registered the gifts he there received, we find that one
hundred and forty separate individuals contributed to his
aid. Besides what he then personally received, collections
were taken up for him in four churches in the city on the
seventh of November. In Worcester, one hundred and 
fifty-four individuals contributed, and when we consider that to
most of these persons, he of course repeated a sketch of
his history, we cannot but wonder that his energies
flagged not. We must, at least, admire his industry.</p>
          <p>He received in Providence two hundred and fifty
dollars; and then after making a short visit at Woburn, he
returned to Boston, having gathered during the ten weeks
he had been absent, six hundred and thirty dollars. Here he
remained, visiting occasionally at Roxbury, Charlestown,
Cambridge, and other neighboring towns, until about the
middle of January, when, placing in the hands of his
treasurer two hundred dollars more, which he had
gathered since his return from Providence, he started

          <p>This kind friend was right. Peter found sympathizing
friends in New York, and before the middle of February he
had received in that city and Brooklyn $1,146 45.</p>
          <p>He then went on to Burlington, and in that city and its
neighborhood, he remained until May. His heart now beat
high with the hope of a speedy reunion with his loved
ones; and even those among his friends who, at first had
been furthest from uttering words of vain encouragement,
now cheered him on. They looked upon him with wonder.
All unlettered as he was—but four years out of slavery—they
could hardly credit his strange success, while hearing from
his own lips the story of his travels.</p>
          <pb id="pickard331" n="331"/>
          <p>Peter was not spoiled by his good fortune, and never
presumed upon the indulgence of his benefactors.
Everywhere his manners were the same—modest and
respectful, yet full of earnest dignity—the result of
virtuous self-respect. “In every place I go,” said he, “I aim
to associate with the best people. I never knowed nothing
gained by going into low company.” And he was right.
The best men in every place he visited opened wide their
doors at his coming; and at their tables, notwithstanding
the prejudice—once well-nigh universal—against color, he was
a welcome guest.</p>
          <p>Early in May, he again departed on his travels; and
earnestly did he hope that this tour would be the last,
before he should be ready to start in another direction—
to meet those for whose ransom he had become a
wanderer.</p>
          <p>He went directly to New York, where he received the

accumulation of what he could earn when all the service
exacted by an absolute master, from day to day, had been
performed. His wife and three children attempted to escape
from slavery, and were re-captured. Meanwhile, he
himself, returning to the region in which he was born, has
found his yet surviving mother and his numerous brothers
and sisters, who are living in and near Philadelphia. He has
also found friends and benefactors, as he has travelled
from place to place, in the enterprise of collecting the
exorbitant sum which is demanded for the liberty of his
wife and children.</p>
                  <p>“I have examined his papers and am convinced of their
authenticity, and of his entire honesty and reliableness.

          <p>In New Haven, Peter remained until about the middle of
July; and we find, by referring to his registry, that he
received donations in that city from more than two hundred
and fifty persons. In the list of his benefactors—Heaven
bless them all—we find “<hi rend="italics">Carpenter's Millinery 
Help,</hi>” 
“<hi rend="italics">Ladies in Shirt Factory,</hi>” 
“<hi rend="italics">Workmen in Clock Factory,</hi>” 
“<hi rend="italics">Young Ladies of Miss Dutton's School,</hi>” 
“<hi rend="italics">Lancasterian
School,</hi>” “<hi rend="italics">Ladies of the Rubber Factory</hi>,” 
and “<hi rend="italics">Pupils of
Webster High School.</hi>” We also find one contribution set
down as—“<hi rend="italics">Money Lent.</hi>” Yea, verily, “HE 
 <hi rend="italics">that hath pity on
the</hi>
<pb id="pickard334" n="334"/>
<hi>poor lendeth to the</hi> LORD; <hi rend="italics">that which he hath given will
he pay him again.</hi>” In the same long list we see “<hi rend="italics">Anti-Abolition,</hi>” 
and then, “<hi rend="italcs">A Slaveholder,</hi>” and 
again, “<hi rend="italics">A Slaveholder patterning after Abolitionists.</hi>”</p>
          <p>After receiving three hundred dollars in New Haven, our
traveller went up to Hartford, and there, also, he received
three hundred dollars. Thence, with a grateful heart, he
went to Wethersfield, where he remained three days, and
collected twenty-one dollars. August seventh, we find him
at Middletown, Ct., where in one week, he received one
hundred and twenty-six dollars.</p>
          <p>While in Middletown he encountered a lady who in
consequence of marrying a Northern man, had been
transplanted there from South Carolina. She assured Peter
that the slaves were far better off than free negroes.
“Indeed, I know all about it,” said she, “for my mother
owns plenty of them, and not one of them is obliged to
work so hard as I do myself. Here the free negroes are
begging around, many of them half-starved, and some of
them stealing and going to prison.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, ma'am,” answered Peter, “they do that, both
white and colored. It is not the colored people alone that
beg and steal; and I have been told that there are more
white people in the prisons than black ones, any how.”</p>
          <p>“Well, that may be, but they are better off in the South,
where they are all taken good care of.”</p>
          <p>“So I came away and left her,” said Peter, as he related
this incident, “but I couldn't help wishin' I knowed
whether she'd like to be a happy, well-fed slave herself.”</p>
          <p>The next week he spent in Meriden, where he collected
<pb id="pickard335" n="335"/>
eighty dollars; and August 22d we find him at
Bridgeport. Here, also, he found many friends;
though at one house where he called, he met a
violent rebuff. The master met him at the door; and Peter,
as was his custom, modestly proffered his 
request—presenting at the same time his papers. The <hi rend="italcs">gentleman</hi> did
not wait to examine these, but proceeded in a loud voice to
curse him “mightily.” “I know,” cried he, “it's all a d—d
lie. There's a parcel always coming round telling their lies. I
don't believe one word you say. You ought to be arrested.
There's a lazy pack of you that make it a business to go
around whining about having families in slavery. It's time it
was stopped.” So saying, he turned his back upon the 
suppliant; and Peter quietly walked down the steps and
into the street.</p>
          <p>On mentioning this incident in town, he learned that this
gentleman himself <hi rend="italcs">had property in slaves</hi>. Another
slaveholder in the same town he called upon, who received
him kindly, and assured him that, <hi rend="italcs">though slavery was not
so bad after all as he imagined, yet he was not to blame
for wishing to get his wife and children.</hi></p>
          <p>Notwithstanding these slight ripples on the surface of
the waters, Peter received in Bridgeport one hundred and
thirty-six dollars; and on the fifteenth of September, he had
found his way to New London. Here the friends of
humanity contributed one hundred and fifteen dollars for
his aid; and the good people of Norwich, whose charity he
next besought, gave him one hundred dollars.</p>
          <p>The first of October found him at Northampton, and
though he staid not long, yet those in that town who 
“<hi rend="italics">had pity on the poor</hi>” gave him forty-five dollars.</p>
          <pb id="pickard336" n="336"/>
          <p>Once more Peter directed his steps toward Syracuse.
How different were the emotions that now swelled his heart
from those which dwelt there when he first approached that
city, may be inferred from the following extract from a letter
written at this time by a friend, who from the first had
watched his progress with the deepest interest:</p>
          <q type="letter" direct="unspecified">
            <text>
              <body>
                <div1 type="letter">
                  <p>“It seemed almost a hopeless undertaking. The idea of
raising five thousand dollars, by the simple recital, in his
own uncultured words, of his strangely interesting story
was certainly not probable; and, but for the wonderful
Providences that had restored him to his mother, and for his
earnest faith in the success of his project, it would have
seemed like mockery to encourage him to go on. But that
simple faith was mighty, and he went out. Wherever he met
noble generous natures, there he presented his plea for
aid—and not in vain. Many of America's proudest names are
enrolled among those who delighted to encourage his true
heart by kindly words and generous gifts. The blessing of
the All-Merciful rest upon them! He who has said,
‘Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these, my
brethren, ye have done it unto me,’ will not forget their labor
of love.</p>
                  <p>The $5,000 is ready. It is a great price to pay the
mean man, who has appropriated to himself all their
past years of hard labor. But they are his property—
<hi rend="italics">constitutionally</hi>; and he must be well paid for all the
<hi rend="italics">care and watchfulness</hi> which he has exercised in their
behalf. How long! Oh! how long shall such mockery
exist!</p>
                  <p>But little more, we trust, remains for our patient
friend to do before he shall have all things arranged
<pb id="pickard337" n="337"/>
for the exit of those loved ones from the house bondage.
There are no doubt kind hearts that will still find pleasure
in assisting to raise the sum necessary to defray their
travelling expenses.</p>
                  <p>“Oh! that the journey were commenced! That journey
which will end in such a joyful embrace of husband and
wife, father and children; so hopelessly separated—so
rapturously met. Beyond the power of the master—far from
the sound of the overseer's whip <hi rend="italics">free</hi>! FREE! <hi rend="italics">and all
together!</hi> Heaven speed the hour that shall bring them
release!</p>

          <p>In Syracuse, he received letters from Rev. Mr. May to
Rev. G. Hosmer, Buffalo, also to Rev. Dr. Willis, T.
Henning, Esq., and Rev. J. B. Smith, of Toronto, C. W.</p>
          <p>The eleventh of October saw him in Buffalo, where,
through the kind offices of Rev. Dr. Hosmer, and Peter's
friend, Mrs. Legrand Marvin, who had known
him well during a previous residence of several years in
Alabama, he received eighty dollars. On the thirteenth he
crossed to Toronto—not for the purpose of soliciting funds
but merely “to see how his brethren (the fugitives from
slavery) prospered,” and “to enjoy the pleasures of
treading for once upon <hi rend="italics">free soil</hi>.” Here he spent the
Sabbath, visited two colored churches,
and gratefully received a present of fifteen dollars.</p>
          <p>The next Sabbath found him at the little village of
Camillus, N. Y. Here he had many friends, who had long
been watching his career, and praying for his ultimate
success. He had not previously called on them for
contributions, but at this time collections were taken up
for him in both the churches. “He can succeed
<pb id="pickard338" n="338"/>
without our aid”, said Rev. Mr. Bush, of the
Methodist Church, “<hi rend="italics">but we cannot afford to lose this
opportunity.</hi>” To this sentiment each heart responded.
During the day he received sixty-three dollars; and heartfelt
prayers were offered for his speedy re-union to those for
whose ransom he had so faithfully labored</p>
          <p>He now resolved to return to Burlington, and thence
to Philadelphia, for the purpose of completing the arrangements 
for the purchase of his family before the
coming of winter. Negotiations had been opened,
some months before, by Mr. Hallowell, a wealthy merchant 
of Philadelphia, with Mr. John Simpson, of
Florence, Ala., who had agreed, as soon as the requisite
funds should be forwarded to him, to buy the family for Peter. 
Accordingly, soon after Peter's return 
to Philadelphia, his friends in that city having
contributed the balance of the sum necessary to defray
the expenses of their journey, a clerk of the house of
Hallowell &amp; Co. was sent to Florence with the money;
and with instructions to receive the family, and to conduct
them to their future home among the free.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XXXV.</head>
          <head>EXPERIENCE OF THE RETURNED
FUGITIVES.</head>
          <p>BEFORE noon on Saturday, the fifth of April, 1851, Vina
and her children returned to their deserted cabin. Through
what an age of anxiety and suffering had they passed
during the three weeks which had elapsed since they
forsook the shelter of its lowly roof. Then the hope of
liberty had caused their hearts to throb, and their dark eyes
to gleam with an unwonted light; now their hearts were
hard, and still in their deep anguish, and a heavy shadow
dwelt beneath their downcast eyelids.</p>
          <p>The best of the furniture and clothing which they had
left, had all been stolen and conveyed away during their
absence, but this they heeded not in their
despair. True, many hours of tedious toil, by night, had
been required to purchase these few comforts, but now
that <hi rend="italics">liberty</hi> had been rudely snatched from their eager
grasp, they had no tears to shed for minor losses.</p>
          <p>At noon, the people came in from the field. Most
of them looked wistfully upon the captured fugitives,
and when they said “<hi rend="italics">Howd'y',</hi>” their voices had a
mournful tone. Others, however, were glad they had
been brought back, “bekase,” they said, “dey's nuthin'
<pb id="pickard340" n="340"/>
but niggers, no how, and dey's allers so mighty good,
and never gits de cowhide; now dey'll des find out how
good it feels to git a cuttin' up.”</p>
          <p>After dinner, the family were sent out with the other
hands to plant cotton. Ah! their labor just then was
greatly needed, and for that reason, probably, the day of
vengeance was postponed. They knew it was not
forgotten; for dark hints were often uttered in their hearing,
and threatening looks were cast upon the runaways.</p>
          <p>In gloomy silence they pursued their regular labors,
till Wednesday morning, when Mr. McKiernan, attended 
by Smith, the overseer, entered the field. Vina
knew their errand, and her indignation rose—but she
was helpless. She saw them approaching the spot
where young Peter was at work, and heard them order
him to strip. Poor fellow! he was wholly in their
power, and he obeyed.</p>
          <p>There stood the mother and counted the two hundred
heavy lashes that fell upon the naked back of her first-born
son. He bore his torture bravely. Not one cry for mercy did
he utter; not one imploring look did he vouchsafe the
fiends, who sought to bend his spirit; and not till they had
finished, did, he speak.
“This is the last time,” said he then to the overseer,
“that you shall ever strike me. I never will be whipped
again by any man.”</p>
          <p>“Hush your mouth, you d—d rascal,” cried his master,
“or I'll have as much more put on you.”</p>
          <p>They left the young man, and came to his mother. Smith
attempted to tie her. “No, Sir,” said she, “I don't belong to
you, and you aint gwine to whip me. Yer's my mass'r—I
belong to him, and he may kill
<pb id="pickard341" n="341"/>
me if he want to; but I'm not gwine let you tie me nor whip
me. You don't like me, and I never did like you no how. If
my mass'r wants me beat, he must do it hisself.”</p>
          <p>Mr. McKiernan was sitting on his horse, but at this he
dismounted, and bade the overseer give him his whip.
Smith complied, and the <hi rend="italics">chivalrous</hi> master ordered her to
take off her <hi rend="italics">coat</hi>. He then tied her hands, and gave her less
than a hundred blows, a slight punishment for a runaway.
He did it <hi rend="italics">very gently</hi> too, for the skin, though sorely
bruised, was not cut by the cowhide.</p>
          <p>This done, the two worthies repaired to the blacksmith's
shop, where Levin was at work; and then his manly form
was bared, while the fierce lash of the overseer whizzed
through the air as though it loved the sport.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref11" n="11" rend="sc" target="note11">* </ref></p>
          <note id="note11" n="11" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref11">
            <p>* Neither the stocks nor the runaway's heavy irons were called
into requisition, why, we know not, unless their very success in
once reaching the Free States warned their master against provoking
another attempt at flight. The influence of this overseer was
also opposed to such exhibitions of barbarity. “Smith,” Vina
says, “was mons's hard to chillun, and them women whar was
afeard of him, but to the rest o' the hands, he was as good as any o'
the overseers.”</p>
          </note>
          <p>Catharine escaped the cowhide. Her master questioned
her minutely concerning her knowledge of the plan of the
escape, but she appeared so ignorant that he told the
overseer it was not worth while to whip
her. “It's that devilish Peter that's been at the bottom of all
this,” said he, “and I believe the Jew has done the work.
There's Catherine, she didn't understand any of their plans;
but her mother—d—n her, she's
<pb id="pickard342" n="342"/>
got sense enough. It would be just like her to try it again,
but she'll never go and leave her daughter. She's always
doted on her girl, and I'll be d—d if I blame her, for
Catharine is a devilish likely wench. So it's best to keep one
of them on the island, I reckon the old woman. She
wouldn't be long starting off again d—n her, if she took it into
her head. She was always bound to have her own way,
though to tell the truth, she's as clever a woman as ever I
owned.”</p>
          <p>The next Sunday, Vina received the order to prepare 
to go to the island. It did not seem to move her. 
“I don't keer whar they sends me,” said she, “any place is
better 'n this yer.” So with desperate promptness she
packed up the few articles necessary to furnish the cabin
which she was to inhabit there, and that very day she
departed.</p>
          <p>“I liked stayin' on the island a heap the best,” she says,
“out o' sight mostly of both mass'r and Missus. Me and
them had fell out, and I didn't never want to make friends
with 'em no more. I didn't keer about bein' called in every
time any person was took sick, and I just determined that if
they ever sent for me agin, I wouldn't go without they driv
me like a dog.”</p>
          <p>Of all the beating hearts on the plantation, none thrilled
with such a commingling of delight and grief at the return
of Vina and her family, as did that of a maiden named
Susanna.</p>
          <p>She was a bright mulatto, the daughter of  “Aunt
Patsey,” who for the last few years, had taken charge of
the young children. Susanna was a quiet well-behaved girl,
that had been <hi rend="italics">raised</hi> on the place, and ever since they
were children, young Peter and herself had loved each
other. But when his father went away,
<pb id="pickard343" n="343"/>
and left to his family the assurance that if he lived they
should be free. Peter determined to obey his counsel; and
so the union of the devoted pair was postponed for an
indefinite period.</p>
          <p>Now that their great effort to achieve their liberty had
failed, the young man's heart would whisper that perhaps
his father would consider his request no longer
binding. Yet he kept these thoughts hid deep in his own
breast, for he saw that in his mother's heart, all hope of
freedom was not yet extinct.</p>
          <p>But the masters watchful eye had long noticed their
attachment, and, imagining that if Peter had a wife he
would be less likely to ran off again, he determined that
now they should be married. No favorable opportunity
however occurred for him to urge the matter, until the
crop was laid by in August; when, according to his annual
custom, he gave his slaves a barbacue. Then he
determined that the marriage should take place.</p>
          <p>The long trench was duly prepared with its bed of
glowing coals, over which were roasting numerous pigs
and chickens, with the flesh of sheep and oxen in
abundance. Peter was aiding in the preparation of the feast,
when he was summoned into the presence of his master.</p>
          <p>“How would you like to marry Susanna, boy?”</p>
          <p>“I don't care about marryin' any body now, Sir.”</p>
          <p>“But Susanna says she loves you, and you ought to
have her.”</p>
          <p>“No , Sir, I don't care about marryin' without my
people's willin'.”</p>
          <p>“It's no matter about your mother, boy, I give you
<pb id="pickard344" n="344"/>
leave, and you needn't ask her anything about it. Go and
dress yourself.”</p>
          <p>“I've got nothin' to dress in.”</p>
          <p>“Well, go and put on clean clothes, any how, and then
come back to me.”</p>
          <p>Peter went to his mother's cabin. For a time he hesitated,
but his master's command was absolute, and he had bid
him hasten. His long-years' love for Susanna was not
silent, but that voice he knew how to quell at duty's
bidding. His mother, he could not bear to vex her.</p>
          <p>Half undecided what course would be the wisest, he
dressed mechanically in clean working-clothes. (He had a
suit of Sunday clothes which he had bought himself, but
these he would not wear to please his master) His toilette
completed, he sat down again to think. He could not long
defer his decision, for his master would be as angry at his
delay, as if he should refuse obedience to his orders; so at
last, scarcely knowing whether he was doing right or
wrong, he left the cabin, and approached the spot where he
had left McKiernan.</p>
          <p>Susanna, having previously received an order from her
master to dress and come to him, was already there.</p>
          <p>One of their fellow-slaves, a preacher, named William
Handy was now called to marry them; and in a few minutes
they were marching around the field at the head of a troop
of their young companions, who with gay songs and merry
laughter were celebrating the marriage of their friends.</p>
          <p>Vina soon heard what had occurred; but she was one of
the cooks, and she continued quietly to baste
<pb id="pickard345" n="345"/>
the meat, though every moment her wrath was rising higher.
Levin stood by her side, and he, too, was
indignant. Soon the master approached. “Why don't
you march with the others?” said he to Vina.</p>
          <p>“I aint a soldier,” replied she, “and I don't know nuthin'
about marchin'.”</p>
          <p>“Why, what is the matter with you?”</p>
          <p>“Nuthin' more'n common; and things that's common yer
is shockin' to strangers.”</p>
          <p>“What's that? Say that again.”</p>
          <p>She repeated her words. “There's not a plantation in a
million o' miles whar thar's such works as thar is yar.”</p>
          <p>“Better mind how you talk, girl, or I'll give you a slap.”</p>
          <p>“I don't keer what you do. I would n't keer if you killed
him and me too. You've done made a heap o' matches, and
none of 'em never prospered, no how.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, I was so mad!” she says, “every time I looked
down, 'peared like I could see sparks o' fire a comin' out o'
my eyes. Then he went to the house and told the missus I
was powerful mad. She 'lowed he ought to be ashamed o'
himself, kase she said he'd done me mean, and she did n't
blame me if I was mad. Well, he said, when they wanted to
marry, nobody should n't hinder 'em. He'd marry 'em hisself
when he liked.”</p>
          <p>The young people lived in the cabin with Aunt Patsey,
and for some time the current of their lives flowed calmly
on. After about a year, a little boy was folded to Susanna's
breast—a fine, “peart,” healthy child. She named him
Edmund; and he soon became very dear to the hearts of
all his kindred. But Vina 
<pb id="pickard346" n="346"/>
now that the tide which had whelmed her in despair had
fallen, lived in hourly expectation of a summons to her
husband; and she was sad at the advent of this little one.
She, too, loved the baby dearly; but she knew it formed
another tie to bind the young father fast to slave-land.</p>
          <p>When little Edmund was a few months old, he was
seized with whooping-cough, and then he needed his
mother's care. But she was forced to go each morning to
the field; and though Aunt Patsey was not heedless of
her little grandchild, yet she had so many children to look
after that she could not always watch him. So he took cold,
and then his cough became worse; and week after week, he
continued to grow weaker, till it was plain that he could live
but little longer.</p>
          <p>Oh! how his mother longed to stay in and nurse him for
the last few days! But in vain she begged this privilege of
the overseer—and when, in her sorrow she sought her
mistress, who had seen four of her own little ones laid in
the grave, the lady sharply bade her “Go out to work.” 
“It's no use,” said she, “for you to stay in—you don't know
how to take care of children—if you did, your baby never
would have been so bad.”</p>
          <p>A week later, a messenger was sent to the field to bid
Peter and his wife <hi rend="italics">come and see the last of their child;</hi>
and, first obtaining permission of the overseer, they
hastened to the cabin. The baby did not know them
now—and though the young mother fondly kissed his lips,
and breathed his name in tenderest accents, she could
awake no answering smile. A fierce convulsion shook his
little frame—it passed—the child was dead.</p>
          <pb id="pickard347" n="347"/>
          <p>Fond mother, who hast watched thy little one by day
and night, until the angels bore him from thy arms,
rememberest thou the anguish of that hour? What torture
would have rent thy heart if thou hadst seen him wasting—
dying, and all for lack of care — thou wast forced to toil
for the gain of a remorseless tyrant! God pity the mother
who is doomed to live—a slave!</p>
          <p>“Ah, well,” said the mistress, when they told her that
Susanna's child was dead—“it will be better off. My life is
nearly worried out of me by sick children, and I am sure I
wouldn't care if they were all dead. It is just as well for
Susanna, for it never would have done her any good if it
had lived.”</p>
          <p>Early in the spring of 1854, another son was born unto
them, and this they called Peter. Vina had now come down
from the Island, and had resumed the office of general
nurse, which she had filled for many years; and when little
Peter was five weeks old, the master asked her if she
thought Susanna was well enough to go out.</p>
          <p>“No, Sir,” replied she, “she aint over and above strong,
no how, and she oughtent to go out when the weather's so
bad.”</p>
          <p>“Well, if you think so, I will give her another week.”</p>
          <p>But the overseer was “pushed,” and before three days,
Susanna was sent out to the field. A heavy rain came on
soon after, which was followed by a chilling wind.</p>
          <p>“Please, Sir,” said the young mother, “may I go to the
house? I'm mighty cold, and my side aches powerful.”</p>
          <pb id="pickard348" n="348"/>
          <p>“No, no; you used to be smart enough, but now you're
always complaining, and getting to be no account. Go 'long
to your work.”</p>
          <p>A week longer she labored, but by that time she became
so very ill that they could force her to go out no more. The
doctor was called, but he could do but little to relieve her.</p>
          <p>Month after month she lay in the cabin a patient
sufferer, and watched with a mother's interest the growth
of her little Peter. Poor baby, he was weak and sickly, and
she often wished that she might take him with her to that
better land, where there is neither toil, nor pain, nor sorrow.</p>
          <p>“Don't stay long,” said Susanna, as she saw Peter
going out of the cabin one Sunday morning in August,
“it's lonesome when you're gone.”</p>
          <p>He returned and sat down by her side. All day she
talked sweetly to him of that blest home to which she was
hastening; for “Susanna was a religious girl,” and her long,
lonely days of sickness she had spent in thinking of the
happy land above. “I'm gwine away from you now, Peter,”
said she, “but I shall leave our little baby with you. You'll
take good care of him for my sake—won't you? O Peter,
you'll be lonesome when I'm gone, but you must think I'm
happy; and it wont be long before you'll come too.”</p>
          <p>Her eyes grew very bright as she thus strove to comfort
her sorrowing young husband; but when the sun went
down her eyelids closed—<hi rend="italics">she had gone home.</hi></p>

          <head>CHAPTER XXXVI.</head>
          <head>“THEY TAKE GOOD CARE OF THEIR
PROPERTY.”</head>
          <p>FOR more than two years after her return from “<hi rend="italics">dat dar
jaunt to de Norf,</hi>” Vina remained upon the island. Sometimes
both of her sons were with her there; but Catharine was
kept constantly upon the home place.</p>
          <p>“Well, girl,” said her master, some months after her
return, “do you remember the road you travelled when
that rascal carried you all off ?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Sir,” replied Vina, “I remember every inch I went;
and I could go over it again with my eyes shot.”</p>
          <p>The boys also were questioned concerning their
knowledge of the route, and they gave similar answers; 
“though to tell the truth,” says Vina, “I should n't know no
more about it when I got off o' the river, than if I was
blind.”</p>
          <p>Their prompt assertions that they knew “every inch of
the road,” did not diminish their master's fear that they
might repeat the attempt to escape, and he determined to
take every possible means to prevent another trial. But he
could not control his own base passions; and though Vina
never smiled, and seldom spoke cheerfully in his
presence, his evil nature impelled him
<pb id="pickard350" n="350"/>
to make one more effort to accomplish the base purpose in
which, years before, she had so signally foiled him. Her
gloom, the consequence of disappointed hope and stern
resolve to make another effort to escape his hated rule, he
construed into the effect of shame at her disgrace; and
now, if ever, he deemed he might succeed in depriving her
of her honor.</p>
          <p>It was winter. She was upon the island engaged in
picking up trash and burning it to prepare the land for
plowing.</p>
          <p>The master came, and sat down by the fire. She took
no notice of his approach, but continued picking up the
rubbish, and adding it to the heap.</p>
          <p>“Vina! O, Vina!”</p>
          <p>She did not answer—there was something in his tone that
made her angry.</p>
          <p>“Girl! O, Girl! Come here!”</p>
          <p>She turned her head towards him, but continued her
work.</p>
          <p>“Here—this fire don't burn much.”</p>
          <p>“No, sir—its just kindled—it'll burn to-reck'ly.”</p>
          <p>“Well, you bring some more trash to crowd in here.”</p>
          <p>She brought him a handful of sticks.</p>
          <p>“Look here, Vina,” said he in his most insinuating tone,
“I intend to stay here on the island to-night— won't you
come to my house, and stay with me?”</p>
          <p>“What you mean, sir, by askin' me such a thing as
that? <hi rend="italics">You mought as well sing a psalm to a dead cow as
to name such a thing as that to me</hi>. I hav n't forgot how
you've used me and my chillern just bekase I done what
any person else would do. I did n't do no wrong, and I ain't
ashamed o' goin' off ; but you ought
<pb id="pickard351" n="351"/>
to be ashamed, sir, to talk to me this way—after my knowin'
all about you that I do.”</p>
          <p>“Well, now look here,”urged the <hi rend="italics">gracious</hi> master,
“I've forgiven all that—it's all dead and buried.”</p>
          <p>“No, sir, it ain't buried so but what I can scratch it up,
and it never will be forgot—not by me.”</p>
          <p>“Well, won't you come to my house? If you will, I'll do
all I can for you; and you never shall want for anything.”</p>
          <p>“No, sir, I never will come to your house. Thar's a little
old hut yon', that you built for me, whar don't keep the rain
out nights; I cun stay thar like I has done. You think I done
forgot seein' poor Lydia, only a few months ago, bucked
down afore that very door o' yourn, and all the five
hundred blows the poor thing tuck just for you?”</p>
          <p>“Well, I didn't do that.”</p>
          <p>“No, sir, but your son did; and your wife sent him the
note tellin' him to whip her till he just left the breath o' life
in her, and Aunt Lucy heard him a readin' the note. Thar in
the mornin', when thar's a white fross on the ground, she
was stripped by your son—a right young man, not of age
yet, and beat with whips and an oak paddle as thick as my
hand till the breath was a'most gone out of her body. That
too, after you'd whipped her yourself for killin' her child.
She would n't a killed it only 'twas yourn, and she knowed
what she'd suffer about it if it was seen.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref12" n="12" rend="sc" target="note12">* </ref>

never shall.”</p>
          <p>“The devil! Don't you stand there, and tell me
you don't like me.”</p>
          <p>“Well, sir it ain't no hurt to tell the truth; and that
is so—I don't like you, and I don't want to hear no
more such talk as you talked to me to-day.”</p>
          <p>“Well, you think of it,” said he, returning to his
softest tone—“and you'd better do as I want you to.”</p>
          <p>“It's no use talkin”—I'll never put myself in your
power while I live.”</p>
          <p>“What's that girl's name of yours?”</p>
          <p>“What girl?”</p>
          <p>“Why, your daughter, there.”</p>
          <p>“You know her name, sir, just as well as I does.
You done knowed her from the day she's born. Her
name Catharine—why, what you gwine say 'bout
her?”</p>
          <p>“I say she's a devilish likely gir, and I—”</p>
          <p>“Now, mass'r I wants to tell you—if you ever comes
a foolin' round her, you'll be sorry. You know I
never said I'd do a thing, but I done it, or least ways,
tried; and if my girl ever consent to your mean ways,
I'll kill her or you—one.  I ruther die a peaceable 
death 'an to be hung, but jst as sure as you meddles
with my daughter, I'll do what I say.  I ain't gwine to
see her like the other girls yer, whar you been the
means o' gettin' all cut to pieces.”</p>
          <p>The master walked away. He had listened to such
<pb id="pickard353" n="353"/>
a lecture as he seldom received; and from that time he
ceased to torment the resolute woman that dared to
speak the truth even to his face. Vina was very impudent.
He might have killed her on the spot; but
she knew he would not strike her. Her just and fearless
words, slave though she was, shielded herself and
the daughter that she loved from further insults.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding that during their absence their
cabin had been robbed of nearly all it comforts, yet
on their return from their unfortunate journey Northward,
Vina and her family resumed their former industrious
habits. The boys cultivated their patches
as had been their custom, and saved every penny
which they gained, in order to fulfil their father's injunction—
to provide every thing needful for their mother's comfort. 
Meantime, Vina and Catharine 
labored faithfully both nights and Sundays, and the
well-mended garments and warm stockings that the
brothers wore testified to the skill with which their
fingers wrought.</p>
          <p>During the summer of 1853 the patches yielded
well, and the people had all their little crops secured
before Christmas. They were obliged to sell them to
their master, as had ever been his rule; and when
they were all ready, the overseer weighed the corn
and cotton they had raised, and promised them to see
 that <hi rend="italics">all was right</hi>. The master affected to rejoice in
their success; and told them to come to him <hi rend="italics">the first
day of Christmas</hi>, and he would pay them.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, when Christmas came they all, accompanied
by the overseer, went to the house to receive
their money.</p>
          <p>“Well, well,” said the master, “I havn't got the
<pb id="pickard354" n="354"/>
money now; but I'll tell you what I'll do. Every one of you,
big and little, that wants to go to town, may go to-morrow,— 
and I'll go too, and pay you all in town. I've got the
promise of some money that is due me there to-morrow.”</p>
          <p>“Aha!” said Vina, as they came away, “I know how it
will be—you all won't git no money to-morrow. He aint
gwine pay no money, and I wont go.”</p>
          <p>But her companions could not believe that their master
would thus deceive them; and the next morning the whole
plantation force climbed into the huge wagons and took
the road to Tuscumbia.</p>
          <p>To one unused to <hi rend="italics">Christmas sights</hi> in slave-land a more
grotesque spectacle than was presented by these loaded
wagons could scarcely be imagined. There were old women
with red and yellow turbans—stiffstarched and tall—and a
score of boys and girls—some with bare heads, and others
glorying in comical old rimless hats and bonnets, in styles
unknown to Paris milliners.</p>
          <p>Then there were sage uncles and prim young girls who
were anxious to show off their best behavior “gwine to
town”—and these sat up stately and stiff; while those
less dignified, with laugh, and song, and frolic, and
grimace, reminded them that “<hi rend="italics">Christmas time</hi>” would not
last all the year.</p>
          <p>The master met them as he had promised at the store of
Mr. N—, and there, instead of paying them the money, he
selected a lot of poor damaged calico, and called the
women to choose each of them a dress. They looked at
each other in consternation. Here was the fruit of all their
toil! Nights and holidays they had spent for this—a few
yards of mean thin
<pb id="pickard355" n="355"/>
calico, that would not pay for making up. Their eyes
rolled angrily and their lips pouted the displeasure
which they dared not speak; and so the calico was
measured off, though in their hearts they scorned the
mean-spirited wretch who could thus stoop to cheat
them.</p>
          <p>One or two, however, rebelled. Catharine went quietly
and selected something for herself. “Ugh!” said her
master, “that's too dear.”</p>
          <p>“Well,” said she, “if I can't have that, I don't want
none at all.”</p>
          <p>He finally yielded and allowed her to take what she had
chosen. But when Amanda, a middle-aged woman,
followed her example, and sought such goods as would
make comfortable clothes for her children, he swore she
should take such as the others had, or none at all.</p>
          <p>“No, sir,” said she, “I wouldn't walk out de store with such
stuff as dat dar. I done worked hard all dis year to make a
crap, and I don't want to be cheated now. I got a house fall
of chillern, and dey's all mighty nigh naked, and I want
something decent to make clothes for 'em.”</p>
          <p>“Hush your mouth! you huzzy!” cried her master,
“you shall take what I give you.”</p>
          <p>“Well, sir, if yon dont git me what I want, I'll git it 'fore
de year's out. If I can't git full pay for my crap one way, I
will another.”</p>
          <p>He raised his hand to strike her.</p>
          <p>“I don't keer if you does whip, me. I'm gwine to have
my rights if I cun git 'em.”</p>
          <p>This <hi rend="italics">peculiar</hi> shopping ended, the whole company
returned home in ill humor. “I told you so,” said
<pb id="pickard356" n="356"/>
Vina, “I knowed he wasn't gwine to pay you all for
yer craps. He didn't have no money promised him
in town, no how. That's the reason I wouldn't go.
I wasn't gwine to foller him off to town for money,
when I knowed he wasn't gwine to give it.”</p>
          <p>Vina had not been many months on the island before
her mistress began to wish for her presence on the home
place. She was an excellent nurse in sickness, and for many
years she had been called in to wait upon any of the white
family that chanced to be ill; and so faithful and competent
was she, that when Vina was in the sick-room the mother
felt no uneasiness. Among the slaves her field was wider,
for there, unless in extraordinary cases, she was both
doctor and nurse.</p>
          <p>At last Mrs. McKiernan told her husband that they
must get Vina back, or they never should raise any more
children. “The trouble with them commenced,” said she,
“when Vina and her family first ran off, and since that time
there has been nothing but bad luck with both the women
and children. There's Delphia might have been alive now
if it hadn't been for those fools of doctors.”</p>
          <p>“Well, Vina,” said the master, when she had been more
than two years on the island, “how would you like to go
back to the low place?”</p>
          <p>“I don't keer 'bout gwine back, sir.”</p>
          <p>“But your mistress says she would like to have you
back. Several of the women will be sick soon, and she
wants you there.”</p>
          <p>“I don't want nuthin' to do with 'em, sir; you done sent
me off yer out o' spite, and now the sick ones may
<pb id="pickard357" n="357"/>
take care, o' their selves. I ain't gwine to be runnin'
after 'em.”</p>
          <p>“Well, if you don't go now, you may not get a
chance when you do want to go.”</p>
          <p>“I don't keer nuthin' 'bout it, sir; I don't want to go thar,
never.”</p>
          <p>After a few weeks, however, she packed up the few
cooking utensils which she had there with two or three
other articles of furniture, and went home to the cabin
which Peter had built for her so many years before.
Still she was dark and gloomy—her heart had lost its
light; and though she did not quite despair, yet her
chance of meeting her beloved husband seemed to
lessen day by day. But now there was much sickness on
the place; and in sympathy with the suffering of her
sisters, she found transient forgetfulness of her own
griefs.</p>
          <p>Delphia, to whom reference was made by Mrs. McKiernan, 
died a few days after Vina ran off; and her story,
though it reveals a course of cruelty too base
even for savages, shows but another phase of slavery.</p>
          <p>Smith, the overseer, at that time, was severe, as has
before been stated, only towards children, or those
women who were afraid of him. “He knowed,” says Vina, 
“the people mostly would fight him if he tried to beat 'em,
and so he managed to do without much beatin'. But them
whar's feared of him fared mons's hard—'pears like he
never knows when to stop, if he gits mad at one o' them
kind.”</p>
          <p>Smith had a great deal of company on Sundays;
and as the overseers are furnished by their employers with
corn and bacon, for their families, as well as flour,
<pb id="pickard358" n="358"/>
coffee, and sugar, so many guests were quite expensive to
Mr. McKiernan.</p>
          <p>One Sunday afternoon, he walked down to the quarter,
and saw two horses hitched at the overseer's gate.</p>
          <p>“Whose horses are these?” asked he of a group of
women that stood near.</p>
          <p>Delphia chanced to reply.</p>
          <p>“Smith has a heap of company, don't he?” said the
master.</p>
          <p>“Yes, Sir,” said Delphia, “last Sunday thar was six
horses hitched to his fence, and every one of 'em was
carried off, and fed.”</p>
          <p>Some evil-minded tale-bearer took the first opportunity
to report this conversation to the overseer; and he was
enraged.</p>
          <p>A few days after, the master plainly expressed his
opinion to Mr. Smith respecting the number of his guests,
adding that he knew it was so, for he saw them there
himself.</p>
          <p>“You did not see them,” said Smith, “you were not in
sight when they were here. Some nigger has told you; and
it is no other than that lying, tattling wench, Delphia.”</p>
          <p>From that hour he vowed vengeance on the poor
woman; swearing at the same time there were other ways
to kill a cow besides shooting her or knocking her in the
head.</p>
          <p>Thereafter, he never gave Delphia a moment's rest. She
was one of the plow women; and though she was not in a
condition to bear extreme fatigue, he compelled her day
after day to plow with her mule in a trot. She dared not
stop, for his eye was ever on her;
<pb id="pickard359" n="359"/>
and when the other women told her she was killing herself,
she only replied, “You know how Smith hates me, and he
will beat me to death if I don't mind him.”</p>
          <p>Thus week after week, she ran all day in the plow, till at
last she was forced to stop, and she went, with her mule,
to the quarter. Smith was at his house, and he saw her
coming.</p>
          <p>“What are you there for;” cried he.</p>
          <p>“I'm sick, Sir, I can't work.”</p>
          <p>“No, you're not sick. You need n't put out your mule—
tie him there; and in just two hours you shall go out again.
I'll give you that long to rest.”</p>
          <p>She went into her cabin, and in less than two hours the
doctor was sent for. Before night, poor Delphia lay still and
cold in death, with her dead baby by her side.</p>
          <p>As two of her fellow-slaves were digging her grave the
overseer came up. He jumped down into the narrow house
they were hollowing for his victim— “There,” said he with
an oath, “this is the place where all liars and tattlers ought
to go.”</p>
          <p>But that not the overseers alone were spiteful and even
murderous in their barbarity, may be inferred from the
following incident, which occurred soon after Vina went
home from the island.</p>
          <p>A woman, named Leah, was taken sick in the field, and
her master being near, she went to him for permission to
go to the house.</p>
          <p>“What the devil do you want to go to the house for?”</p>
          <p>“I'm sick, sir.”</p>
          <p>“Sick, d—n you! go to work; and if I hear any more of
your complaining, I'll give you something to
<pb id="pickard360" n="360"/>
complain about.” So saying, he gave her a few cuts with
his cowhide, in token of what she might expect if she
repeated her request, and she went back.</p>
          <p>But she grew worse; and not daring to leave the field
without permission, she went again to her master.</p>
          <p>“It's a devilish lie. You are not sick; if you are, I can
cure you.” With these words he flew at her, and beat her
cruelly; after which, with kicks and curses, he sent her
back to her work.</p>
          <p>It was impossible for her to remain much longer. She
started to leave the field, and Vina, who had been a witness
of the scene, followed her to her cabin. We give what
followed in her own words.</p>
          <p>“In about a half hour, her child was born, and such a
sight as that child was would make any person cry that has
any heart at all.

The overseer's wife was thar, and she was shocked
mightily. She called her husband, and he come and looked
at it; and two gentlemen, whar was thar a visitin' him, they
see it too; and they all 'lowed they never see nuthin' like it
in all their lives.</p>
          <p>“Well, I staid, and done all I could for Leah, and dressed
the baby—for it was livin' after all, and when I got all
done, I went up to the house to tell Missus. Mass'r was a
sittin' by, but I never stopped for him—I told her the whole
story, and all about the beatin' too. She hated it mightily,
partic'lar when I told her 'bout the overseer and them other
two white men seein' it. ‘That's just like, you,’ says she to
Mass'r, ‘you're always bringing some disgrace on this
plantation. The report of this will go all over the country.’</p>
          <p>“ ‘Why I did'nt know she was sick,’  says he.</p>
          <pb id="pickard361" n="361"/>
          <p>“ ‘Yes, you did know it, she told you she was sick, and
if she had not, you might have known better than to beat
her so, and she in such a state. You did it on purpose to
disgrace yourself, and the plantation, it is just like you. I'll
order my carriage, and go away till the talk about this is
over. It is just the way you always do—just like you.’</p>
          <p>“That's all the comfort Leah got from Missus. She was
mighty sorry to have folks know such works was a gwine
on, but she didn't never do much for them whar was a
sufferin'. If she could keep cl'ar o' the disgrace, that thar
was all she cared for.</p>
          <p>“Leah's baby lived a week, and I reckon it was a good
thing it died, for 'peared like it suffered a heap all the time.
Oh! it aint no wonder so many o' their chillun dies, its
more wonder that any of 'em lives when the women has to
b'ar so much.”</p>

          <head>THE RE-UNION.</head>
          <p>TOWARDS the close of the year 1854, their being no
immediate need of Vina's presence on the “low place,” she
went back to the island. Susanna had died during the
summer, and now the boys were both with their mother,
leaving Catharine sole tenant of the old <hi rend="italics">home cabin</hi>.</p>
          <p>“The island,” although it was five miles above the home
plantation, was not a lonely place. There were good
neighbors on the river bank opposite, and with some of
these, the slaves who were kept here, formed lasting
friendships; even Vina, though she had been so morose
and sad during these last years, had not been unmindful of
the sympathy of her own people.</p>
          <p>On Sunday morning, December seventeenth, as she was
sitting alone in her cabin, a woman belonging to Mr.
Hawkins, who owned a plantation on the North bank of the
river, came over to pay her a visit.</p>
          <p>“What do, you think, Vina?” said she, as soon as she
was sure there were no listeners, “I heard a great secret in
town last night.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, I don't know what I thinks till I yers what it's
about,” replied Vina.</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Well, Peter's sent for you all I and dar's a man in</hi>
<pb id="pickard363" n="363"/>
<hi>town whar's come from some place 'way off to de Norf
dar, to tote you all off.</hi>”</p>
          <p>“How does you know?” asked Vina, her eyes dilated,
and her whole frame trembling with excitement.</p>
          <p>“Why, I's to town last night to Mr. Simpson's store, and
I yer Mr. Simpson say so hisself. Dey all's a makin out de
papers, and dey'll send for you 'fore many days.”</p>
          <p>The visitor soon departed, and Vina sat down to think,
but her brain whirled, and she was glad when her sons
came in, that she might share with them the great joy that
was swelling in her heart. She did not for one moment
doubt the truth of the report, for it was what she had
expected. “O poor faithful loving heart! thou hast borne
grief with patience, wait but a little longer, and thy joy
shall overflow.</p>
          <p>The mother and her sons now held a consultation on
the most judicious course for them to take; and they
determined to say nothing on the subject until they should
hear more. Catharine they could not see before the next
Sunday. Oh, how they wished that she could share this
joy.</p>
          <p>On Monday morning, they went to work, as usual. The
bright glad hope with which their hearts were warm shone
not in their dark faces, they had schooled their features to
wear ever the same calm look. Full well they knew that any
change of countenance might be construed into a token of
some hidden hope. Slaves must not seem to hope for aught
save Christmas Holidays, though they may laugh, and
dance, and sing, so they evince no <hi rend="italics">thought</hi> beyond the
present.</p>
          <p>Soon after midnight the next Wednesday, the island
people were all called up. They were to kill hogs that
<pb id="pickard364" n="364"/>
day, and every one upon the place was obliged to be in
motion.</p>
          <p>Great fires were built here and there for scalding the
fated animals, and sharp knives, gleaming in their strange
light, seemed impatient to begin the sport. Soon all was
noise and bustle. The merry butchers talked and laughed,
their victims squealed, and grave old women scolded at the
trifling of the youngsters; for though the day's work was
no trifle, it was a change in their monotonous life, and fun
and frolic reigned.</p>
          <p>About ten o'clock in the morning, Vina, who amid all the
confusion, was watching for a messenger, saw her master
coming up the hill from the river. He walked towards the
cabins, and soon called—“Vina! O Vina!”</p>
          <p>She strove to quell the tumultuous throbbings of her
heart, and she suceeeded in subduing all appearance of
emotion—so that when she reached the spot where the
master stood, her face was calm, and her voice was 
clear as usual.</p>
          <p>“Well, Vina,” said he, “how would you like to see Peter?”</p>
          <p>“Mons's well, Sir,” replied she.</p>
          <p>“Do you know where he is?”</p>
          <p>“I reckon, sir, he's in Cincinnati.”</p>
          <p>“No—he lives in Philadelphia, and he's bought you all.”</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Bought us?</hi>”</p>
          <p>“Yes, he's bought you;—how would you like to go to him?”</p>
          <p>“Why, if it's true, sir, I'd like to go mighty well.”</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">If it's true?</hi>—don't you believe it?”</p>
          <p>“I don't know, sir, whether I believes it or not.”</p>
          <pb id="pickard365" n="365"/>
          <p>“Well, don't you suppose choose?—Don't you belong to me?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Sir, I know you can.”</p>
          <p>“Well, if you want to go, make haste and get yourselves
ready; for I've got to carry you all over to Florence to-night.
There's a man there, who has come for you—he can tell
you all about Peter.  You ought 
to have been there before now, but you are all so
devilish hard to hear that I had to hallo there for
a boat, 'till I'm right hoarse.”</p>
          <p>“We didn't hear you, Sir—the hogs kept such a
fuss.”</p>
          <p>“I know—I know—but you all must hurry yourselves now.” </p>
          <p>He went to the boys, and told the news to
them; but they, too, made strange of it, and seemed
to doubt his words.</p>
          <p>“Well,” said he, “you all act like you don't
believe me—now, I'm no ways anxious to sell you,
and if you don't want to go, you must get ready devilish quick,
for I must have you in Florence to-night; and we
must cross the river before dark.”</p>
          <p>The mother and her sons entered their cabin, and
hastily, gathering up such of their things as they could
carry easiest, they hastened to the river. Among their
fellow-slaves were many whom they counted friends, but
even to these they had no time to say
“Good bye.” Crossing to the main land in a canoe, they
sprang into the wagon which waited for them there, and
drove toward home, the master riding by
their side.   </p>
          <p>As soon as they arrived at the quarter, he called the
<pb id="pickard366" n="366"/>
overseer. “See, here, Smith, get on your horse, and go
quick and tell Catharine to come here. Ride fast; for I'm in a
devil of a hurry.”</p>
          <p>Away went the overseer to the clearing, where he
found Catharine busy chopping down a tree. “Here,
Girl,” cried he, “give me your axe—go quick to the
house—you're sold, and your master sent me for you
in a hurry.”</p>
          <p>Half bewildered, yet guessing the truth, Catharine
walked as fast as possible towards the quarter. Her
mother's figure was the first that met her eye. Then her
pulse beat quicker—she bounded towards her.</p>
          <p>“Mother, what is it?”</p>
          <p>“Why, yer father's sent for us, chile—leastways Mass'r
says so.”</p>
          <p>“Has he done bought us?”</p>
          <p>“Yes; so your Mass'r says.”</p>
          <p>“I don't want no more!” cried the girl, as with eager
hands she assisted her mother in their hasty preparations.</p>
          <p>The master remained in sight, and every minute
shouted to them to hurry, or they could not cross the river;
thus confusing them so that they could think of nothing.
Vina wished to see her mistress, who owed her about three
dollars for chickens, and had promised her the money on
Christmas. Vina knew that <hi rend="italics">she</hi> would not refuse to pay her
now, but Mr. McKiernan would not let her go. “Never
mind,” said he, “I'll pay you when we get to town.”</p>
          <p>“Wouldn't you like to take your little grandchild with
you?” asked the master.</p>
          <p>“Yes, sir,” said Vina, “if I could—how much you ask for
him?”</p>
          <pb id="pickard367" n="367"/>
          <p>“Oh, a trifle!” replied he, “I'd sell I him to you
for a trifle—perhaps a hundred dollars.”</p>
          <p>“Well, Sir, here's all my things; they cost a heap
o' money and, if I had time, I could sell 'em all.”</p>
          <p>“I'll pay you for them when we get to town: but
come—hurry yourself.”</p>
          <p>Vina understood the value of his promise to pay her for
the goods she left behind; but she was helpless.
She threw a change of clothes for each of them
into her trunk—she had no time to select the best—
and tying up her feather bed which Peter had bought
for her nine years before, she said “Good bye” to a 
few mothers, who chanced just then to come in
from the field to nurse their babies, and left her cabin—
to return no more.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding all their haste, they were not in time to
cross the river before dark; and so they staid at Mr. Wm.
Jackson's till morning, when they went into town.</p>
          <p>They stopped at Mr. Simpson's store, where the papers
were to be signed; and here they saw the
young gentleman who had been sent for them.</p>
          <p>It was a cold raw, day, and the slaves were shivering in
their plantation clothes. “I wish, Sir,” said Vina to her
master, as they stood in the chilling wind, “you'd give me
money enough to buy me a thick shawl.”</p>
          <p>“Why, Girl,” said he, “I could n't do it. I came from
home in such a hurry, that I did n't have time to
get any small change—I have nothing with me less than a
ten-dollar bill.”</p>
          <p>“Seems to me,” said his son-in-law, who stood by,
“these niggers are poorly dressed to be for sale; you
<pb id="pickard368" n="368"/>
might get her the shawl now, and pay for it some other
time.”</p>
          <p>“Oh!” said Mr. McKiernan, “hey've got better clothes,
but they won't put them on.”</p>
          <p>Vina thought of his promise to pay her for the chickens,
and also for the goods she left behind; but she determined
not to ask him again, herself. So when she saw a crowd of
gentlemen standing around, she sent Peter to tell him that
she wanted the money for the chickens.</p>
          <p>“Why, Boy,” said he, feeling in his pocket, “I have no
money smaller than ten dollars.”</p>
          <p>Vina was listening. “Yes,” cried she, when she heard his
answer, “so I thought when you would n't let me stop to
see Missus. I knowed you was n't gwine pay me in town.”</p>
          <p>“McKiernan, d—n it,” said one that stood by “why
don't you give your servants something? You ought to
give them a present for the good they've done you.”</p>
          <p>He muttered something to himself, but made no answer.</p>
          <p>After awhile Peter went to him again, and asked him <hi rend="italics">how
much he would take for his baby.</hi> Poor Susanna's dying
words rang in his cars, and it seemed as if he could not go
and leave her child, that she had so solemnly committed to
his charge.</p>
          <p>“The baby, eh? Oh, you may have it for two hundred
dollars.”</p>
          <p>The young father's hopes were dashed. He could not
raise so large a sum as he had learned that the funds sent
by his father were barely sufficient to defray the travelling
expenses of the family.</p>
          <pb id="pickard369" n="369"/>
          <p>“I say, McKiernan,” said a gentleman in the crowd,
who pitied the distress of the slave-father, “I think 
you ought to give that old woman her grandchild—
I heard you say she has always been a good servant—that
you never struck her a lick, and that she never deserved
one—and that her family have always behaved themselves
well. Give them the little one for good measure.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, I'll sell the child cheap to them.”</p>
          <p>“Ha! sell it! They've no money to buy it. Give it to them—
that would be no more than fair.”</p>
          <p>Said another, “Where in the world did Peter get the
money to buy his family?”</p>
          <p>“Oh,” replied McKiernan, “he's got rich relations; his
friends are all wealthy. I saw one of his brothers last year
in Philadelphia—William Still is his name. He is rich, and a
devilish likely fellow too. He keeps
the Anti-slavery Office. I was in there twice, myself, and I
saw him write a hand that I could n't beat, nor you either.”</p>
          <p>“What office, did you say?”</p>
          <p>“The Anti-Slavery Office. Ha! ha! I was as good an
Abolitionist as any of them while I was there. I
tell you—that William Still is a fine fellow. Another of the
brothers has a store, and Peter I believe owns half of it.”</p>
          <p>The business was at last concluded, and soon after the
stage drove up that was to convey them to Eastport. 
There they were to take the boat which could come
up no higher on account of the low state of the water in
the river.</p>
          <p>“When we got in the stage,” says Vina, “I felt free.
 'Peared like I didn't weigh no more'n a feather.”</p>
          <pb id="pickard370" n="370"/>
          <p> “Aha!” said Catharine, looking down with ineffable
contempt upon her soiled and tattered garb, “reckon when
I git whar father is, I'll drap off these old duds.”</p>
          <p>“Why?” said her mother, “I don't reckon he's got any
new clothes for you.”</p>
          <p>“But didn't Mass'r say he got a store?”</p>
          <p>“Pshaw! child, don't believe all he says.”</p>
          <p>“I believe that, for he never would have said such a
thing, if it wasn't so.”</p>
          <p>The young gentleman who had them in charge was
closely questioned by the Captain of the boat, and by
sundry other officious persons at Waterloo—a little village
on the north side of the river, nearly opposite Eastport. He
was, however, allowed to go on board with them, and they
were glad, for soon they had their supper—the first food
they had tasted since daylight in the morning.</p>
          <p>All went smoothly till they reached Paducah. Here they
were obliged to change boats, and again was their young
guardian subjected to a series of impertinent questioning,
as to what he was going to do with the negroes, &amp;c. He at
length succeeded in transferring his charge to a Louisville
boat; but the captain of this was exceedingly uneasy about
the slaves—he having seen them when Mr. McKiernan was
conveying them back to slavery—nearly four years before.
This young man was evidently from the North; indeed he
did not scruple to confess it; <hi rend="italics">and if he should be running
these niggers off, and if his boat should bear him on in
the commission of such treason against the Constitution
and the Union,</hi> alas! what ruin would ensue. Yet he had
straight papers, and did not act in the least like an
Abolitionist so after much deliberation, he concluded
<pb id="pickard371" n="371"/>
to let them come on board; but at the same time he
resolved to watch them well, lest the fellow should
play some Yankee trick.</p>
          <p>They arrived at Louisville in safety, and lost no
time in seeking a boat for Cincinnati. But lo! the
valorous captain of the packet they had just left was
there before them, and his sage warning procured from
the commander of the Cincinnati boat a stout refusal
to take them on. Their young guardian was now
sorely perplexed; but fortunately he recollected that
he had an acquaintance in Louisville, who was a merchant
of some note. To this gentleman he hastened
in his extremity, and by <hi rend="italics">his</hi> influence with the cautious
captain, he at length secured a passage for himself
and the four ransomed slaves to Cincinnati.</p>
          <p>The nearer they approached the end of their long journey,
the more restless and impatient grew the mother. She had
learned to bear suspense and sorrow. She had waited and
been patient; but this rapid and sure approach towards the
fulfilment of her hopes was strange and new. She could not
eat nor sleep for very joy. The attention of her children, however, was
more easily diverted, by surrounding objects, and as
the boys found occasional employment on the boat,
the hours to them were far from wearisome.</p>
          <p>They all suffered exceedingly from cold. Their
clothes were thin and old; but what cared he who
clutched in his hard grasp the avails of all their years
of toil, beside the five thousand dollars for their ransom?—
what cared he if they should perish by the
way? <hi rend="italics">He held the gold.</hi></p>
          <p>It was the morning of the Sabbath—the last day of
<pb id="pickard372" n="372"/>
the year 1854. Peter rose very early, and walked
down to the wharf. He had been in Cincinnati for a
week, waiting to greet his loved ones—how long the
hours had seemed while his heart trembled between
hope and fear. One hour he felt sure that he should
soon clasp in his fond arms the precious forms of wife
and children—the next, a hundred fears arose that all
his hopes, even now, were doomed to disappointment.
He had not heard from them since from the papers he
had learned of their return to slavery, perhaps—Oh!
how the thought now shook the fabric of his hopes—
perhaps to torture and to death. Four summers had passed
since then—four seasons where fearful sickness is wont to
make its annual visits to the dark, unhealthy quarters of the
slave.</p>
          <p>But on this holy Sabbath morning, these fears no longer
vexed him; for but a few hours had passed since the
telegraph had brought him tidings of the safe approach of
those for whom he waited.</p>
          <p>He stepped on board the “Northerner,” and the
first man he met was the agent of Mr. Hallowell. A
moment more, and wife and daughter—both were
clasped to his true heart, while on each side his manly
sons, with grateful reverence, gazed upon their father's
face.</p>
          <p>In that embrace no toil or sorrow was remembered; their
swelling hearts had only room for love and gratitude, and
praise to Him who had not betrayed their trust.</p>
          <p>At the home of Levi Coffin the ransomed family were
welcome; and as that good man himself received them
there, his kind heart thrilled with a delicious joy, in which
the angels sympathized.</p>
          <pb id="pickard373" n="373"/>
          <p>Rest ye, poor hunted ones. No more shall “Christian
wolves” prowl along your pathway, for the golden hand of
charity hath taken from their cruel fangs the power to do
you harm. Aye, ye are free! How changed from the poor
trembling fugitives that so lately feared the echo of your
own unequal footsteps. Rejoice! for gold hath power when
justice fails. Be glad! for mercy lives, though on the fairest
portion of our country's wide domain her hands are chained—
her tongue is silent.</p>
          <p>The news of this glad re-union spread rapidly among the
citizens of Cincinnati, and on two successive evening,
public meetings were held for the benefit of the shivering
strangers. Gifts of warm clothing, and of money to defray
the expenses of their journey onward, were gladly offered
by those who love to “clothe the naked,” and who rejoice
in the “setting at liberty of those who were bound.” Many
worthy persons also proposed to entertain the family at
their houses, but being already settled at Mr. Coffin's, they
deemed it wisest to remain there during their stay in town.</p>
          <p>On the third of January they left for Pittsburg. There,
also, they were received with joy; for Peter's story had
found interested listeners in that city, as he had passed to
and fro between Cincinnati and Philadelphia</p>
          <p>While they remained at Pittsburg, a meeting was held
for them in the Bethel Church, at which the whole family
appeared in the clothes they wore from the plantation. The
grateful joy of the father, which beamed so brightly from
his smiling face, and the shrinking modesty of those who
had been redeemed from bondage through his patient
efforts, will be long
<pb id="pickard374" n="374"/>
remembered by those kind friends who there offered them
the greetings of the free.</p>
          <p>On the tenth, the travellers reached Philadelphia, but
here they made no stop. Poor Vina was, by this time, quite
worn out by excitement and fatigue, and
all the family were suffering from colds contracted on the
river. So they hastened on to Burlington, where Peter had
previously made provision for their reception in the family
of a colored friend.</p>
          <p>Often, during Peter's weary wanderings here and there,
while collecting money for the ransom of his family, was the
momentous question asked, “<hi rend="italics">What will they do when they
are free?</hi>” To answer this important inquiry is all that now
remains.</p>
          <p>The first few days were spent by the re-united family in
resting from the tedious journey, and in rendering
themselves presentable to the new relatives and friends
that longed to greet them. Then came the delightful visit to
Peter's aged mother. She had heard of their arrival in
Cincinnati, and had been, for some days, expecting them at
her home.</p>
          <p>We need not picture the glad meeting of the venerable
woman with the wife and children of her long-lost son. The
sight of their happy faces filled her heart with holy
gratitude; for in each form so lately released from slavery's
hated chains, she saw a living witness of her Great Father's
love. Year after year her heart had sorrowed for her sons,
and now, like Israel to Joseph, she could say, “I had not
thought to see thy face, and lo, God hath showed me also
thy seed.”</p>
          <p>But even in that glad circle beat one sorrowing
<pb id="pickard375" n="375"/>
heart. Young Peter turned sadly from the joyful greetings
of his new-found kindred, for the sound of a little voice
rang in his ears. “<hi rend="italics">I am not there, my father!</hi>” was the
wailing cry—and the last parting gift of his
dying wife seemed stretching forth its little hands to claim a
place among the free. Poor baby!—God forbid that thou
shouldest live—a slave “Let us trust that in His good
Providence this little one may yet be brought to share the
blessings of that liberty which, without his presence his
young father can never half enjoy.</p>
          <p>Early in February, Catharine went to reside with her
uncle, William Still, in Philadelphia, for the purpose of
attending school, and also of receiving instruction from her
aunt in the practical duties of a free woman.</p>
          <p>Young Peter has obtained an advantageous situation in
the service of Mr. Richard Ely, at New Hope, Bucks county,
Pa.; and Levin is perfecting his knowledge of the
blacksmith's trade in Beverly, N. J.</p>
          <p>The father and mother, during the summer (1855), have
been at service in a large boarding-house in Burlington;
and though they are not yet entirely settled, the
arrangements are nearly completed by which, for the first
time in their lives, they may enjoy the comforts of their own
home.</p>
          <p>We must not omit to mention a novel marriage that has
occurred in the family since their emancipation. The
previous relation of the parties, as well as the motives
which impelled. them, may be gathered from the subjoined

        <head>APPENDIX.</head>
        <head>SETH CONCKLIN</head>
        <p>WAS born February 3, 1802, at Sandy Hill, N. Y.
Previously to her marriage his mother had been a teacher in
the schools of Vermont. His father was a mechanic, who
was accustomed to go South in search
of employment. He died in Georgia, leaving his widow with
five children, of whom Seth, then about fifteen years of
age, was the oldest. He was not wholly without property,
but what little he had, he
left in charge of a man, who defrauded the family of every
cent of it and fled to Canada. They became dependent
upon the boy Seth, who took up the business
of a pedlar, and so procured a livelihood for his mother and
sisters. It is remembered how careful he was to save every
penny for them, how he went upon long journeys, being
absent for weeks at a time, how anxiously 
his return was watched for, how highly he was
thought of, not only by the little ones of his own
household, but also by the children of the neighbors; how
the children, when they descried the weary young pedlar
returning after a long tramp, ran to meet him and quarrelled
for his hand and hung upon his coat.</p>
        <p>After a while, Mrs. Concklin was induced by some 
<pb id="pickard378" n="378"/>
relatives to go to Canada. There was a more promising
prospect for her in that country. Seth procured a situation in
a lumber yard; where his employer esteemed him so highly,
that in order to keep the lad contented, he took into his
family a little sister of Seth's, Eveline. The lumber man, Mr.
W—, treated him with uniform confidence. This man was
subject to violent fits of intemperance, when he would
fasten up his house and keep his wife and children in the
utmost terror by his wild and frenzied proceedings. At such
times Seth was the only person who had any influence over
him. Again and again he seized his gun and threatened to
shoot Seth, whom be charged with colluding with the family
against him. But the lad, as his sister well remembers, stood
calm and unmoved by the threats of the madman. So fearful
was Mr. W— in his sane moments, of being forsaken by Seth,
who, he knew, wished to join his mother, who had sent for
him, in Canada, that he caused the little Eveline, Seth's
sister, to be locked up in a chamber up stairs, so that her
brother could communicate with her only by climbing a tree
which stood near her window. He seized an opportunity
when his master was unable to rise from his bed, to take his
little sister away. He did not go without bidding farewell to
Mr. W—, who paid him his wages and shed tears at parting
with the youth. “I shall go to utter ruin now that Seth has left
me!” the master exclaimed.</p>
        <p>The boy and girl set out on foot for Canada. They met
with much kindness. Sometimes a kind woman, a mother,
would take them in, give them food and shelter, wash the
little girl and comb her hair. From others they received
harsh words, and thus they
<pb id="pickard379" n="379"/>
trudged on. They were observed and spoken of as
“the children.” For though Seth was some seventeen
years of age, his appearance was very boyish. The
country was then new and wild, and log houses were
the principal habitations to be seen. In one place in
the neighborhood of Watertown, a good woman living 
in a neat frame house, surrounded by a large farm,
a Mrs. Coles, treated the young travellers with especial
kindness, took a fancy to the little Eveline, wished to
retain and adopt her, as her own children were all
grown up and married; and made Seth promise that
if he returned to the States, be would bring Eveline to
her, and let her have the child. At this stage of the
journey, the little girl fell sick and was worn down by
fatigue, and grew fretful and cried a good deal, but
Seth was anxious to reach Sackett's Harbor; and he
coaxed and threatened her. She remembers how they
used to sit down by the road-side to rest, and how her
brother used to cry, and she thought it was because
his pack was so heavy, and she wanted him to let her
take it, although it was beyond her strength.</p>
        <p>At last they reached Sackett's Harbor one afternoon.
Seth found that the steamboat fare was higher than he
could pay. He took his sister to a public house, bade her
go to bed and sleep till he called her the next morning. The
weary child slept till ten o'clock the next morning, and upon
waking and not finding Seth, grew frightened and thought
he had left her; but he soon came. He had engaged a man
with a small sailboat (a smuggler), to take them across the
Lake to Gravel Point, which they hoped to reach that
same evening. It was September. The weather was cold,
<pb id="pickard380" n="380"/>
with flurries of snow. They had been out on the Lake hardly
an hour when a rain-storm arose, and the waves grew
angry and dashed into the boat, so that it required constant
bailing, and there was nothing to bail with but a leaky old
coffee pot, and that was soon lost overboard. The little girl
was very much frightened. She screamed and took off one
of her shoes to bail out the water. The boat made little or
no headway till dark. They were all drenched to the skin,
the water going over them all the time. Seth's sister
remembers their getting round a dangerous point called
Pillar Point. The opposite shore, which they were
approaching was apparently uninhabited. But, although the
others could not see it, the little girl descried a small log hut
in the distance. They gained the land at last, and the man
and boy set themselves immediately to gather sticks and
wood to make a fire to warm and dry themselves, and keep
off any wild beasts. Eveline, however, entreated them so
earnestly to go in the direction in which she insisted she
had seen the log hut, that at last they yielded. After walking
some distance, it appeared in sight, and they found that she
had not been mistaken. At the hut they found a young
married couple, squatters, who had been settled there only
a few months, and who received them with a hospitable
welcome. The woman said she had seen their boat while it
was daylight, and had watched it for some time. This couple
had their chief dependence for food upon game. The only
eatable they had in the house was some wheat flour. The
woman made bread for them and for their supply on the
morrow. She divided her bedclothes with them. The hut was
so
<pb id="pickard381" n="381"/>
low that a man could hardly stand erect in it. There
was no chimney; a fire was made at one end, and the 
smoke found its way out through the roof.</p>
        <p>The next day they started by the lake for Gravel Point,
and arrived at sunset. The weather had cleared. As they
were approaching land, they saw a two-horsed wagon just
starting for Kingston, some four or five miles distant. Seth
was so anxious to secure a seat in the wagon for his sister,
that when they got into shallow 
water, he bade her take off her shoes and stockings.
They both jumped into the water and ran to overtake the
wagon. There were a number of men with it, but they
refused to let her ride, as, they said, the road was new and
very bad, scarcely a road—they were carrying rails to prop
and at the wagon—they doubted whether they should be
able to go through. They took no notice of Seth and his
sister. The mud was so deep—Seth sinking into it over his
boots—that he took the little girl in his arms, who with his
baggage made a heavy burthen. She begged to be put
down. At last she was allowed to walk, and tried to 
jump from log to log, but she fell again and again into the mud and was
completely covered with it. It began to grow dark. They got
to Kingston, however, before the wagon. At the ferry a fat,
good-natured old woman insisted upon taking off the
child's clothes, giving her a good washing, and wrapping
her up in a buffalo skin.</p>
        <p>The young travellers reached Kingston at two o'clock in
the morning; and with the assistance of a watchman, found
the dwelling of a Mr. Roleau, with whom their mother
lodged. She received her two children with great emotion,
laughing and weeping
<pb id="pickard382" n="382"/>
hysterically. She had been sick, but was on the recovery.
During her illness her business, keeping a small shop, had
gone to ruin, and she was earning bread for her children
with her needle.</p>
        <p>Eveline was ill for three months, from the cold and fatigue
of the journey. Seth took to peddling again through the
approaching winter and the following summer. But the
winter after that, the second in Canada, he became
discouraged. One day he brought back such a pittance that
he threw down his pack, and said he would never take it up
again. He knew not what to do. Occasionally he found some
transient employment. He searched the newspapers
diligently to seize upon what might offer. One day, in
looking over a newspaper, he found something about a
haunted house. “Here's a ghost story!” he said to his mother
and brothers and sisters, “come, let me read it to you.” It
turned out to be an advertisement of a house in Sackett's
Harbor  which had the reputation of being haunted, and in
which the owner was willing that any one should live, rent
free, until the place should get a better name. Seth
exclaimed: “I'll go take that house, and we shall have
nothing to pay.” He started instantly for Sackett's Harbor,
with the consent of his mother (they had no fear of ghosts),
and returned in three days, having found and engaged the
house in the suburbs of the place; large and commodious,
originally built for an hotel.</p>
        <p>While the family were preparing to leave Kingston, a
robbery was committed on the money-drawer of the shop,
adjoining the, house where the Concklins lived. Seth was
arrested and put in jail on suspicion of being the thief. The
sole ground of the charge, thus brought
<pb id="pickard383" n="383"/>
against him by the shopkeeper, was that Seth being well
acquainted with his two sons, had often been in the shop
and knew where the money was kept. The family felt keenly
the shame of such a charge; and some of their best friends
grew cool. Seth, however, fearless in the consciousness of
his integrity, was convinced that he would be acquitted,
and begged his mother not to be detained by his trial,
which was not to take place for some weeks; but to go
immediately to their new residence in Sackett's Harbor.
Accordingly she started; it was the spring of the year; the
snow was all gone. But just as she had got on board the
vessel with all her baggage, and with her five children, a
man came running to inform her that Seth was to have a
hearing, and she must return. There was nothing to be
done but to let the children (the oldest of whom was a girl
of about twelve years of age), go alone with the baggage.
The mother gave this child some money and every possible
direction, and the strictest charges to make no fire and light
no candle in the house till she came. They were to live on
bread and milk. One of the children, a little boy, was sick,
and had to be carried in the arms of his little sisters all the
way. The party of little ones reached Sackett's Harbor in
safety, attracting much curiosity and kindness on board
the boat. The haunted house belonged to a Mr. Comstock,
but a person by the name of Parker had care of it. Lydia left
the other children in the boat and went to look after the
house. In about a couple of hours she returned with the
key, and a man and cart to take their baggage. As they
were on the way to their new tenement, an old man met
them who proved to be a quack doctor, who, struck by the
<pb id="pickard384" n="384"/>
youth and unprotected condition of the little group,
carrying with them a sick child, stopped and questioned
them, took the sick one in his arms, and went with them to
the house. It soon became dark. The children had no
supper. The old doctor said they must have a light. But the
children would not listen to it. It would be against the
express commands of their mother, who feared probably
that they might catch the house or themselves on fire. The
doctor expostulated, but to no purpose. Mother had
forbidden it. He was, it seems, an oddity. His speeches set
the children a laughing. He suspected, he said, that the
house really <hi rend="italics">was</hi> haunted, and that these little things were
the ghosts—they were so afraid of light. He guessed they
had an <hi rend="italics">invisible</hi> mother.</p>
        <p>Three times a day for ten days, till the mother joined her
children (Seth having been fully acquitted), the good man
visited them, bringing them soup, etc., and nursing the sick
child. As soon as their mother arrived, she unpacked her
trunks and furniture, and made the place a good deal more
comfortable. As she was seated at her first meal with the
children, in came the doctor, and stood staring at the party
without saying a word. “I was wondering,” he said at last
to Mrs. Concklin, “whether you were a ghost or a real
woman.”</p>
        <p>The mother brought to her children the cheering
intelligence that Seth would be with them in three weeks.
Eveline, then about eleven years of age, with her little
brother George, kept watch on the shore of the Lake, as the
time drew nigh for the coming of Seth. At last they
recognized his figure, before they could see his features,
on board of a vessel that was
<pb id="pickard385" n="385"/>
approaching, and on which he worked his passage. At this
period the family was tolerably comfortable and happy.
Seth got work. They lived in “the haunted house” one
year. Then, as the owner considered the good character of
the place established, he required them to pay rent. It was
too high for their means, and they removed.</p>
        <p>Seth, recollecting his promise to Mrs. Coles, the good
woman who had been so kind to him and taken such a
liking for the little Eveline when they <sic corr="stopped">stopt</sic> at her house on
their way to Canada, advised his mother to send Eveline to
that lady. She acceded, and the child was sent by the
stage, and received by Mrs. Coles with the most cordial of
welcomes, and adopted as her own,
and taught many things. The child was happy here
and the next winter, Mr. Coles, a worthy and elderly
man, took her in a sleigh to see her mother. Upon
her visit home, Eveline found Seth a soldier. Her
mother was declining, and Seth, having the offer of a
place as a substitute, enlisted for one year, nine months,
nineteen days in Company B. By cooking for the company,
Seth greatly increased his income, and was better able to
assist his mother. As he was not allowed to leave the
garrison, Mr. Coles took Eveline to see Seth and she
recollects how the old man who was a methodist gave Seth
his blessing for being such a good son and brother.</p>
        <p>The next fall, of the eight hundred men in garrison at
Sackett's Harbor, four hundred were drafted to go to St.
Mary's (understood to be a thousand miles off,) and Seth
being young and unmarried, among the number. He
endeavored to be excused but without success.
<pb id="pickard386" n="386"/>
The hope was cherished that he might be induced to re-enlist 
when his time was out. His mother parted with him
with a heavy heart. She told the children she should never
see him again.</p>
        <p>With the help of her eldest daughter, the mother was
enabled to do something for the support of her children,
making sun-bonnets. Seth sent them nearly all his wages,
and kept them so well supplied with money that when his
mother shortly after fell sick, and after an illness of eight
weeks, died, there was money enough in the house for all
the frugal wants of its inmates, and for the expenses
incurred by her sickness and burial. In this her last illness,
she talked only of her absent son, and her dying injunction
to her little ones was to obey Seth in all things.</p>
        <p>Upon the decease of Mrs. Concklin, the unprotected
state of the orphans was published in the newspapers, so
that their kindred might come and take charge of them. Seth
saw the papers. They gave him the first news of the death
of his mother. He succeeded in obtaining a discharge. His
mother died in April, but he was not able to reach home till
August. He found the children in the care of an aunt. His
interest had been awakened in the Shakers, and he
conceived the idea of putting his brothers and sisters in the
charge of a Shaker community.</p>
        <p>With this intention he visited the Watervliet Shaker
settlement not far from Albany, and was so much pleased
with it, that he took the little ones, now every where known
as “Seth's family,” and enrolled them and himself as
members of that community. The Coles, having had a
daughter with five children come home
<pb id="pickard387" n="387"/>
to live with them, gave up Eveline who joined the Shakers
also. Seth remained with the Shakers three years, the
children for a longer period.</p>
        <p>Upon leaving the Shakers, Seth went from place to place,
finding employment now here, now there. He followed the
business of a miller for some time in Syracuse and in
Rochester and other places, never, in all his wanderings,
losing sight of “his family,” keeping always in
correspondence with them. Everywhere he was accounted a
singular man, eccentric, silent, “in the way of bargain,
cavilling for the ninth part of a hair,” and yet generous as
the day. Whenever any attempt was made to cheat him, he
instantly appealed to the law, and, it is said, he never lost
his suit. At the same time he would turn his pockets inside
out to relieve the destitute. On one occasion his attention
was arrested by a poor Irish woman with a number of
children, who told him how they had been turned into the
street for rent, her husband being in jail on the same
account. He asked the amount, and, upon learning it, gave
her what she wanted, but it was nearly all that he had. The
woman immediately fell at his feet in the street and clasped
his knees, and poured out, with Irish volubility, such a
torrent of blessings and thanks that quite a crowd
collected. Seth, much annoyed, turned to get rid of her, and
at last finding he could not silence her, he shook her off,
exclaiming in a way that was characteristic of him: “Get
away, you d—d fool!”</p>
        <p>From time to time, he visited his old friends the Shakers.
(His youngest sister remains with them to this day.)
Although, according to their rules, members who quit
them, lose their membership, yet exceptions
<pb id="pickard388" n="388"/>
occur. And Seth, in consideration of his worth and
eccentricity, was allowed again and again to return into full
communion with the Society of Watervliet. It impressed him
very strongly in favor of the Shakers that they did not
recognize the distinction of color.</p>
        <p>It was after “his family” was settled among that
people, at the very beginning of the abolition movement, 
that Seth Concklin began to take an interest in
that odious cause. And it may be doubted whether it
has ever yet had a more devoted adherent. He recognized 
it as the only hope of the Slave. He saw
clearly, and from an early period through the Colonization 
scheme, how it concedes to the inhuman prejudices 
of the country. He abhorred it as heartily as
Mr. Garrison himself does.</p>
        <p>In a letter, dated July 20,1830, written from Syracuse to
his sister Eveline, he says, “Lest you might be deceived by
that wicked spirit of the American Colonization Society, I
take the liberty to inform you that the American Abolition
Society is the only thorough good spirit which maintains
the rights and privileges of colored people. Be not deceived
by the Colonization Society,</p>
        <p>“They are as cunning as the devil can invent.</p>
        <p>“They rivet the chains of Slavery.</p>
        <p>“They put beneath them all mercy.</p>
        <p>“They deceive many honest white people by saying
that they are friendly to the black population, and raise
funds to send from this land of freedom and religious
liberty all free persons of color whom they can influence.
Be not deceived by that dreadful demon spirit.”</p>
        <p>All that he earned, beyond the means of his own
<pb id="pickard389" n="389"/>
frugal subsistence, was given to the abolition cause. I find
receipts of sums of five dollars and ten dollars from Seth
Concklin, acknowledged in “the Emancipator.” Sometimes
be gave fifty dollars at a time, and once one hundred
dollars. Once in Syracuse, and again in Rochester he was
mobbed for taking the part of black men against white
rowdies, and had to run for his life, and absent himself for
days till their infuriated passions had cooled. At Rochester
he dashed like lightning through the crowd and levelled
the ringleader who had got a rope round a poor colored
man and was otherwise maltreating him, thus diverting the
wrath of the mob to himself. That more than one such case
of the persecution of the colored people should have
occurred years ago in Western New York, will seem
improbable to no one who recollects, as many not very old
persons may remember, what a time-honored custom it was,
not very long since, in the enlightened city of Boston to
drive all “the niggers” off the common on a certain State-Election 
holiday that occurred in the spring of the year.</p>
        <p>On one occasion, early in the history of the Abolition
movement, the people of Syracuse were outraged by the
sudden and mysterious appearance among them of some
Anti-Slavery tracts: no one knew whence they came. The
place was thrown into as great an alarm as if combustibles
and lighted lucifers had been found under every door. A
public meeting was held to devise “summary
proceedings.” It was suspected that some emissary of
Satan had alighted in the town. With the leaders of the
meeting Seth Concklin was on terms of familiar
acquaintance. He attended on the occasion; but retired
before the meeting was brought
<pb id="pickard390" n="390"/>
to a close. Upon returning to their homes, the officers of
the meeting, and all who had taken any conspicuous part in
it, found the accursed tracts had been thrown into their
doors, while they had been so patriotically engaged in
seeing to the safety of the community. Wrath mounted to
the highest pitch against the incendiary, who, it was
rumored, was a stranger putting up at the Syracuse House.
Judge Lynch was invoked. Tar and feathers were got in
readiness. No suspicious stranger was to be found; but it
was ascertained that the offender was an acquaintance of
theirs, Seth himself, who very wisely took care to retire
from the scene. In a few days the excitement died away.
Considering that the offence had been committed by no
impudent stranger, but by one of their own neighbors, and
by no other than so odd and honest a fellow as Seth
Concklin, the people recovered their composure so
completely, that when he shortly returned among them,
they shook hands with him over his escape.</p>
        <p>The subject of this brief memoir appears to have been a
man who had “swallowed formulas.” He was a law to
himself. He took and kept his own counsel. On one
occasion, a colored man, professing to be an agent for the
Wilberforce Colony in Canada West, visited Western New
York, collecting moneys from the charitable. He every
where showed a book, imposingly bound in red morocco,
in which the names of those who contributed to his object
were recorded; among them were the names of men well
known and eminent. This book served as his passport and
recommendation, and secured his success in the towns
which he visited. Our friend Seth, having some suspicion
of
<pb id="pickard391" n="391"/>
this man's honesty when he came to Syracuse, watched
him closely, and became convinced that he was an
impostor. Resolved that the community should be duped
no longer, Seth disguised himself and followed
the fellow, and overtook him in the neighborhood of
Seneca Falls, and there, without being recognized, offered
him a subscription, and when the red book was handed to
Seth to put down his name, he took possession of it, and
refused to return it to the owner. The man complained of
him before a magistrate; Concklin was held to bail for his
appearance at the next General Sessions to answer to the
charge of abducting this book, the property of another.
His friends in Syracuse came promptly to his aid, and
abundant testimony was furnished to his character for integrity and general
correctness. The prosecutor, however, never appeared
against him; and Concklin was considered as being right in
his estimation of the man, and as having done the
community a service, although he adopted a perilous and
illegal way of arresting the depredations of an impostor.</p>
        <p>Not long after this transaction, Concklin spent some time
in the West, visiting, St. Louis, and residing awhile at
Springfield, (Ill.). His chief business then and there, a
business which took precedence in his regard of all other
matters, was aiding the transit of passengers on the Under-Ground 
Railroad. He acted, however, very little in concert
with others. In a time of uniformity and conformity, when
the tendency and fashion everywhere is to ride in troops,
Seth Concklin was a man by himself. He went on his own
hook. His fearless speech brought him into frequent peril.
On one occasion, he was condemning the “Patriarchal
<pb id="pickard392" n="392"/>
Institution,” in such strong terms, that one of his
hearers struck him a heavy blow with his fist; for
which outrage Seth caused him to be arraigned before
the Church to which the offender belonged, and compelled 
him to make confession of his fault. Although
thus fearless, our friend was very cautious in communicating 
with the slaves. He gave them no hope
of his assistance, until he found that they were resolved 
upon obtaining their freedom: then he gave
them all possible information as to time of starting,
and the places to which they should go, adding a small
pecuniary gift, and bidding them never to be taken
alive.</p>
        <p>While he thus felt for others, it was equally
characteristic, of him that he was resolved to see for
himself. He has been known to go miles to ascertain the
actual state of the case in any important matter. In 1838-39,
the western part of New York was in a state of great
excitement, caused by what was dignified at the time by
the name of the “Patriot War,” a border outbreak.
Concklin, true to his character, determined to go and see
what it all amounted to. He knew that Canada was the
refuge of the fugitive slave, and he was anxious that that 
refuge should be preserved for the oppressed. Leaving his
business, he went straight to the frontier, crossed over to
Navy Island, where the head-quarters of the Patriots then
were, and enlisted with them, under the command of the so-called 
Gen. Van Ranssalaer. His purpose was to discover
the designs and strength of the Patriots, and make them
known to the Canadian authorities. After looking
about him and satisfying himself as to the character and
objects of the Patriot army, he desired to be dismissed
<pb id="pickard393" n="393"/>
from the service. But this was not permitted. His
taciturn manners, his evident disinclination to
associate familiarly with the people among found himself,
caused him to be suspected as a spy,
and closely watched. Finding his situation more and more
uncomfortable, he determined to escape from the island at
all hazards. He waited one day till nearly
dark, and, when the sentinel's back was turned
towards him, he unfastened a skiff at the landing, and
with no other oar than a piece of board, watched his
chance and pushed off. He knew that if he should
lose his paddle, he must be carried down the Niagara
river and over the Falls, an appalling contingency.
Scarcely had he started when he was seen and fired
upon. The ball struck his paddle, nearly knocking it
from his grasp. He succeeded, however, in reaching
the American shore, at Schlosser, in safety. At this
point a guard had been stationed by the Patriots, and
he was forbidden to land. Compelled to acknowledge
himself a deserter from Navy Island, he was seized
and very roughly handled, and sent back to the
island.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref13" n="13" rend="sc" target="note13">* </ref>
<note id="note13" n="13" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref13"><p>* Another account says, that Concklin was taken by the
American troops under Col. Worth, stationed, professedly to guard
the neutrality of the United States, on Grand Island, which lies so
near to Navy Island, that the “Patriots” called to the American 
forces and informed them that Concklin was a deserter; and he
was sent back, the United States' officer stipulating only that he
should not be hurt.</p></note>
 There, by order of Van Ranssalaer, he was
confined and closely guarded in a log-house, which
was so situated as to be exposed to the guns on the
Canada side. He could save himself from being hit only by
lying prostrate on the ground, as the sentinel
<pb id="pickard394" n="394"/>
who stood guard over him threatened to shoot him when
he sought the protection of the breastwork, to which the
sentinel himself had recourse. Several shots passed over
him, within two or three feet of him, through the upper
part of his prison. The Patriots said they intended the
British should kill their own spy.</p>
        <p>On the evacuation of the Island by the Patriots,
which took place about a week after Concklin was
put in confinement, he was left behind—the only man
in the place. It was the month of January. His sufferings 
from cold and hunger were severe. He was
the last twenty-four hours without food. He tied his
handkerchief to a pole, and took his station opposite
the Canadian side. The signal was observed; and
very soon a boat came off and took him in, and conveyed 
him to Canada. There he was subjected to a
very close examination by a board of officers. In
answer to their inquiries, he gave them a minute account 
of all that had occurred from his leaving Syracuse 
up to the hour of his examination. His statement 
was committed to writing by several different
persons. The examination was repeated two or three
times. He was well treated, and kindly provided for
during the few days he remained on the Canada side.
When the investigation was ended, and he was about
to return to the States, it was proposed to him that he
should swear to the truth of what he had stated. To
this proposal he readily acceded. His affidavit was
published in the papers at the time. When he arrived
in Buffalo, he published a statement of his treatment
by the United States officers on Grand Island in one
of the leading journals of that city. And he also
<pb id="pickard395" n="395"/>
made complaint at the War Department in Washington,
forwarding to the Secretary a copy of his publication in the
Buffalo paper. The Secretary of War directed the District
Attorney of the Northern District of New York to look into
the case. That officer, living at a distance, caused some
inquiries to be made in Syracuse in regard to the veracity of
the complainant; and honorable testimonials to his
uprightness were presented. The case, however, was never
followed up. Concklin was, for a time, quite a lion at
Buffalo, on account of his prominence in those border
difficulties.</p>
        <p>Not many months after the affair at Navy Island,
Concklin's interest was awakened in the events which were
transpiring on our Southern border. He wanted to know
what the United States Government was doing in Florida
among the Indians there. The newspapers had much to say
of our arms in that quarter. Without consulting with any
one, he resolved to visit that part of the country. As the
best way of getting there, and learning what he wanted to
know, he enlisted in the United States service. The first
intimation of his whereabouts, which his friends in
Syracuse received, was in the shape of a letter directed to
one of them, which we here transcribe:</p>
        <q type="letter" direct="unspecified">
          <text>
            <body>
              <div1 type="letter">

                </opener>
                <p>“JOSEPH SAVAGE: My object in writing to you is that
it may be known in Syracuse where I am; and I request
that you write to me. I have heard nothing from Syracuse
in a year. Direct your letter to Talahasse, Middle Florida.
Should you receive this, and
<pb id="pickard396" n="396"/>
the postage not be paid, let me know it. I am now fifty
miles from the post-office.</p>
                <p>“Last fall I came, from Pittsburgh, by way of New
Orleans and the Gulf, to St. Marks, and eighty miles east of
St. Marks, on the 6th of January, and entered on the
campaign with the 1st and 6th Regiments, United States
Infantry, a few dragoons and several companies of
volunteers, on their way through all the hammocks in Middle
Florida to the Suwannie river, hunting Indians. Near the
end of January our forces met on the Suwannie river, below
Old Town (formerly an Indian Village destroyed by
Jackson), opposite Fort Fanning, East Florida, having
driven before us a few Indians, discovered in the Old Town
hammocks. All the companies (now the 1st February) were
directed back on their trails, scouting through to keep down
the Indians. There does not seem to be any very formidable 
force of Indians in Florida; and I believe that a part of
the murders charged on the Indians are committed by the
white settlers, and many of the public (official?) reports of
the whites and the Indians being killed or taken are untrue.</p>
                <p>“Nearly all the white male settlers in Middle Florida,
over twelve years of age, receive from Government twenty-two 
dollars per month and rations. There is now a report
that a man found in a hammock five Indians in the act of
torturing, by fire, his son. He killed four of them, and the
fifth ran away. Should this be published, you must believe
it without proof. I believe these reports are only pretences
to keep up this shameful war.</p>
                <p>“March 21st, I left a post near Old Town Hammock
alone, unarmed, and travelled one hundred miles
<pb id="pickard397" n="397"/>
through the plains and hammocks without seeing a human
being in five days. This circumstance alone would
convince uninterested people, that there are not many
Indians.</p>
                <p>“But I have farther proof that no great danger is
apprehended from the Indians, from the fact that a
company of United States Infantry near Old Town
Hammock, one of the most interior towns in Middle Florida,
frequently send out scouting parties through the
hammocks without loaded guns and without ammunition,
though they carry their guns with them, but as a mere
matter of form. I do not know that the blood-hounds find
any Indians; though it appears that in East Florida the dogs,
the Spaniards, and our soldiers have captured one old
Indian.</p>

        <p>In another letter of the same date, addressed to a brother-in-law 
in Philadelphia, he repeats the same particulars, and
gives, in addition, some brief and striking instances of his
observation. “I have seen,” he writes, “some of the slaves
on the north border of Middle Florida. They are much more
intelligent than their owners, probably from their being from farther north.”</p>
        <p>The following winter, Concklin appeared again unexpectedly 
in Syracuse. From that time till he went
upon the chivalrous enterprise which cost him his life, he is
believed to have resided principally in Troy, occasionally
visiting “his family” and his sister Eveline married, and
resident in Philadelphia. More than once he made the
journey from Syracuse to Philadelphia, all the way on foot.
He appears to have
<pb id="pickard398" n="398"/>
commanded the confidence of all who knew him. He was a
man of an “incorrigible and losing honesty,” abhorring
deceptions and injustice, and making every injured man's
cause his own. Altogether he was a man of heroic
character. His life was a romance—an heroic poem.</p>
        <p>A gentleman of Syracuse, with whom Concklin lived two
years, states, that on one occasion he sent Seth fifty miles
from home for a horse. He was provided with money to
defray his expenses to and fro by boat or stage. His
employer was greatly surprised to see him returning
leading the horse, instead of riding him. The saddle and a
bag of oats were on the horse's back. He returned nearly all
the money which had been given him for the expenses of
the journey. It appeared that he had walked to the place
where the horse was to be obtained in one day, on
returning he took two days, as being <hi rend="italics">encumbered with a
horse</hi>, he could not walk so fast as without one.</p>
        <p>It is unnecessary to repeat here the story of the humane
and daring enterprise in which he lost his life. Various
accounts of it went the rounds of the newspapers at the
time. We give the following from a Pittsburgh (Pa.) journal,
bearing date, Thursday morning May 29, 1851;</p>

                <p>“A SINGULAR ENTERPRISE.—During the last trip of
the steamer <hi rend="italics">Paul Anderson</hi>, Captain GRAY, she took on
board, at Evansville, Indiana, a United States Marshal,
having in custody an intelligent white man, named J. H.
MILLER, and a family of four slaves—mother, daughter, and
two sons. Captain GRAY subsequently learned from Mrs.
Miller that he had been
<pb id="pickard399" n="399"/>
employed by some Persons in Cincinnati to go to Florence,
Alabama, and bring away this family of slaves—the woman's
husband being in a free State.
For this purpose, with a six-oared barge, procured at
Cincinnati, Miller had gone down the Ohio and up the
Tennessee River, to Florence, there laid in wait till an
opportunity occurred, and privily taken away the family of
slaves. The barge was rowed down the Tennessee, and up
the Ohio, to the Wabash, and up that river till within thirty
miles of Vincennes, where the party was overtaken and
captured by the Marshal. The unfortunate Miller was then
chained, to be taken back to Florence for trial and sure
condemnation, by Alabama slave laws. The <hi rend="italics">Paul Anderson</hi> having landed at
Smithland, mouth of Cumberland River, Mr. Miller made an
attempt to escape from her to the steamer <hi rend="italics">Mohican</hi>, lying
alongside, but, encumbered by
his manacles and clothing was drowned. The body
was recovered and buried about a week afterwards.
The slaves went back to bondage. The barge was rowed
down the Tennessee 273 miles, up the Ohio 100 miles, and
up the Wabash 50 miles, before the party were overtaken.
Mr. Miller, we learn, had a sister and other relatives in or
near Philadelphia. He was
a mill-wright by occupation, and owned property in
the neighborhood of Vincennes.”</p>

        <p>So far the public press. As these accounts are very
imperfect, a person was found who offered to go to Indiana
and make such inquiries as might relieve, in some measure,
the painful anxiety of Mr. Concklin's relatives and friends,
and to obtain his remains, or, at least, if practicable, cause
them to be disinterred and
<pb id="pickard400" n="400"/>
examined. We subjoin a copy of the written statement
made by this agent of Mr. Concklin's friends.</p>

                </head>
                <p>Mr. Chandler (I think), at Evansville, in answer to a
question as to his knowledge of Miller and the abducted
negroes, said, I could obtain information of John S. Gavitt,
the former Marshal of Evansville. He (?) himself believed
and told the parties at the time, that the proceedings by
which Miller was taken out of the State were illegal, and if
such things were to be tolerated, no white man was safe.</p>
                <p>I next called upon John S. Gavitt, who treated me very
respectfully, and seemed not only willing but anxious to
impart every information. He told me that he had Miller and
the negroes in custody, and that he delivered them on
board the steamboat, in care of Mr. John Emison, of
Evansville, to be delivered to the authorities in Florence,
Alabama. I asked him by what authority they were taken.
He said he had the writs in his possession, made out by
Martin Robinson, Esq., of Vincennes. I asked to see them.
He showed them to me. I asked for the privilege of copying
them. This he would not permit, for the reason, he said,
that he believed, “We've all been guilty of <hi rend="italics">illegal
proceedings</hi>, and if it's brought out, I don't want to give our
enemies any advantage.” He said, it was no more he than
others. “I believe,” said he, “we've <hi rend="italics">all</hi> done wrong.” The writ
for the apprehension of Miller was based upon an affidavit
by the aforesaid John S. Gavitt, before Squire Robinson, in
which be swears that Miller abducted from B. McKiernan,
of Florence, Ala., the four negroes. And the writ ordered
<pb id="pickard401" n="401"/>
the said Gavitt to take the said Miller and safely
deliver him to the Sheriff in said Florence, to be dealt
with <hi rend="italics">according</hi> to law. The authority quoted, I think, was,
Sec. 1, No. 62 of the Statutes of Indiana. (I
wrote from memory, not being permitted to copy.) The
other writ for returning the negroes was made, I think,
upon the affidavit of James M. Emison, the man who first
took them up on suspicion. The said James W. Emison is
not an officer.</p>
                <p>I asked Gavitt how he could know the circumstances
stated in the writ well enough to make such an oath? He
then stated substantially as follows: That on or about the
28th of March last, he received a dispatch from Vincennes,
stating that four negroes had been taken up on suspicion,
with the man Miller.
He in turn telegraphed South, and soon got returns
describing the negroes and Miller. He started at once for
Vincennes, and drove the whole distance (55 miles)
in six hours. He says he made the oath because he was
convinced from the <hi rend="italics">description by telegraph</hi>, and
from conversations with the boy Levin, that they were the
same. There seemed to be an indistinctness and confusion
in Gavitt's statements, and though I conversed with him
two hours, and he freely answered
all questions, I did not fully rely on him. For instance, he
would state at one time that he believed
Miller perfectly honest and conscientious in his course;
yet, at another time said, that Miller owned to him that
he was to get $1,000 for the job. He says, his main effort,
while Miller was in his charge, was to get him to turn
State's evidence, and upon that condition agreed
to let him go. This Miller positively refused to do,
though he confessed that there were four others concerned
<pb id="pickard402" n="402"/>
with him. He said Miller offered him $1,000 if he
would let him go. The reward offered for Miller, he said,
was $600, and $400 for the negroes. The story that Miller
told him was, that the negroes were his—his brother in
Henderson (Kentucky) having emancipated them after they
should have worked upon his farm near Springfield
(Illinois) a certain length of time. He says Miller had shaved
his whiskers, and cut off his hair after he was first
discovered by James M. Emison. When he was about
putting him on the boat, Miller called him aside and told
him he would give the names of his accomplices if he
would let him go. He told him it was too late then, upon
which Miller became a perfect picture of despair, and
walking suddenly to the side of the boat, he thought, with
a determination to throw himself overboard, but was
caught by John Emison. Understanding that while Miller
was in custody of Gavitt, he was kept at the house of Mr.
Sherwood (a relative), the present Marshal of Evansville,
and that he had conversation with Gavitt's mother, I
requested to have her called in. She said she felt very sorry
for him, and tried very hard to get him to turn State's
evidence; but he said, nobody was to be blamed in the
affair but himself, and that he was not at all sorry for what
he had done; he had done his duty—a Christian duty—and
felt a clear conscience. Gavitt said that McKiernan told him
that Miller should be hung if it cost him $1,500.</p>
                <p>Further evidence was procured from the office of the
Evansville Journal.</p>
                <p>From Evansville to Princeton, and thence to Vincennes,
<pb id="pickard403" n="403"/>
I went in company with Col. Clark and son,
of the latter place. He (the Col.) gave a statement of
the affair, which made it take quite another direction
from Gavitt's story. He placed Gavitt in no very enviable 
light. <hi rend="italics">He said</hi> that there was a jar between
him (Gavitt) and the Emisons about the <hi rend="italics">spoils</hi>. Of
course the sending back of the “d—d Abolitionist” to
Alabama, was all right with him (the Colonel).</p>
                <p>Having been directed by Gavitt to call on Mr. John
Emison, in Vincennes, I did so. He was pointed out
to me in the street as the stage agent, or, perhaps,
proprietor. I called him aside, and told him that, having
some business in Vincennes, I had been requested by a
friend of Miller's friends to make inquiry concerning him;
upon which the said John Emison broke forth in a strain
like the following: “Now, my
friend, you'd better be pretty d—d careful how you
come into this place and make inquiry about such
men as Miller.” “You've waked up the wrong passengers.” 
“And you might get yourself into the
Wabash river.” “If you'll take my advice as a friend, you'd
better leave town on pretty d—d short notice.” “We don't
allow any G—d d—d Abolitionist going about <hi rend="italics">this</hi> town,”
&amp;c., &amp;c., with many other extras too numerous to mention.
I told him my object in making inquiry of him was a specific one—
solely to gratify, or rather to satisfy, Miller's friends,
and if such a course was likely to produce a disturbance in
the place, I was very sorry. But out of respect to those
who entrusted the inquiries to me, I felt bound to learn
what I could. Emison partially apologised for his haste, and
said he was mad at the d—d Abolitionists on the <hi rend="italics">Paul
Anderson</hi>, who threatened
<pb id="pickard404" n="404"/>
to throw him overboard. (See <hi rend="italics">Evansville Journal</hi>, p. 27.) 
He said he felt for Miller, as deeply as, anybody could—
that he was courageous, and that anybody that was bold
enough to jump overboard deserved to get away. “But,”
said he, “he's dead and buried—he's gone to — with his
manacles on, so you'll know him when he comes up in the
resurrection.” He said he would let me have a letter, which
he had received from the young Mr. McKiernan, containing
further evidence of Miller's death, in addition to the letter
from Hodge.</p>
                <p>Mr. Chandler, of whom I first spoke, told me that he was
informed by Gavitt that the lawyer, who had taken a fee
from Miller of some $50, or $80 (as some said)—when
Miller was brought into court, said lawyer refused to
undertake his case—having received a fee of $25, from the
other party. I asked Gavitt about this: he said it was true,
for he had paid him the $25 himself, though he could not
tell me <hi rend="italics">what the man's name was.</hi></p>
                <p>William T. Scott, sheriff and jailor of Knox Co., told me
the slaves were brought to the jail in the morning (Friday, I
think), and the request made by James Emison, that they
should be put in: he admitted them, though he told me he
knew he had no business to do so. Said Emison &amp; Co. told
him they had taken the negroes the previous morning
about daylight, as they were crossing a bridge. Miller soon
came up, and claimed them as his—they had been liberated
by his brother, in Henderson, Ky., and were to serve for
him a certain time near Springfield. They took the negroes
and bound them, and upon Miller's threatening them with
law, they took him
<pb id="pickard405" n="405"/>
also, and bound him and put him in the wagon with the rest. After
riding five or six miles, and
listening to the logical reasoning of Miller, they began
to be alarmed, lest they might be doing something wrong
in thus binding a <hi rend="italics">white man</hi>, without due process of law,
so they untied him and let him go. He, however, still
continued to follow the wagon, and, it
being still dark, before they were aware, Miller was in
the wagon untying the negroes. When they discovered
this, they threatened to shoot him if he should
again attempt it. Miller still followed the wagon to
Vincennes, where the slaves were committed to jail as
above. A telegraphic dispatch was sent to Gavitt aforesaid,
at Evansville, and by him sent South, from whence be
obtained an answer as before stated.
Gavitt went to Vincennes, with evidence sufficient to
warrant their being sent back; but would not give
the evidence, or make any move in the promises, till
Emison &amp; Co. had agreed to give him <hi rend="italics">one half of the
reward</hi>. This agreed, the oath was made, and Miller
arrested, under a law of the State, for detaining fugitives
from their lawful owners. Previous to this, and I think on
the same day, Miller had taken out a <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi>, under
which the slaves were said to be delivered; but Judge
Bishop, associate judge for the circuit, <hi rend="italics">remanded them to
jail till the next day at 12 o'clock</hi>—of course without any
claim to law, but (with) merely a suspicion that by that time
evidence might be obtained that they did not <hi rend="italics">belong to
themselves.</hi> When Gavitt arrived, and Miller was taken as
aforesaid, his lawyer, Allen, appeared in his behalf, and the
proceedings against him were quashed. After this, <hi rend="italics">Miller
was remanded back </hi>to jail, though Allen says
<pb id="pickard406" n="406"/>
it was done by his (Miller's) own request, that he feared the
mob, &amp;c. While Miller was thus in jail, the owner arrived,
and found his work all made ready to his hand. True, a little
more swearing was needed to prove Miller the abductor of
the negroes, but it was readily furnished by Marshal Gavitt.
Scott says that a young man now in jail, and with whom
Miller talked freely, says, he (Miller) had a quantity of gold
coin quilted into the collar of his coat. Scott thinks it was
not so, as he himself searched him. Scott says, Miller told
him that he had only one thing to regret in the transaction,
and that was that he had not pursued his own course, and
refused to listen to the advice of others. He says the
negroes were well trained, and all told the same story with
Miller until the master came, when they owned him—at least
all of them but Peter. Upon Miller's second sham trial, he
owned all the facts in the case, and pleaded justification.
He was asked why he undertook the work without being
armed: he said, if he had carried weapons he should have
probably felt a strong inclination to use them, and in that
case would certainly have been overcome; consequently,
he had not allowed himself even a penknife.</p>
                <p>I went to see C. M. Allen, Esq., to inquire about <hi rend="italics">the two
fees</hi>, and other matters. I told him that in justice to himself,
some explanation should be given. He stated in substance
as follows: “That on the morning of the day on which the
negroes were brought into town, Miller came to his house
very early—before he was up—he told the same story that he
did to the captors about the slaves of his brother, at
Henderson, &amp;c.; and wished Allen to take out a <hi rend="italics">habeas
corpus</hi> to liberate the slaves. He told Miller that it was a
troublesome
<pb id="pickard407" n="407"/>  
case, and if he undertook it he should charge
him a heavy fee.  Miller asked, how much? The reply
was, one hundred dollars. Miller promptly said, ‘I won't
give it.’ As Mr. Miller was about to leave him, he called
him back and told him it was a hard case to be placed
in such a situation, and with but little means. He
showed his purse and counted his money, before him,
There was forty, dollars, or perhaps a little over, in
gold, silver and bills. Miller told him if he would
undertake his case he would give him
fifteen dollars. There followed a parley about the fee, and
Mr. Allen did not tell me how much he received; but he
said he told Miller, if he had not told him the truth, that he
should abandon his case at any time,
whenever that should appear. So when Miller was brought
into court, after the arrival of McKiernan, he refused to act
for him, because the evidence seemed so strong that Miller
had misrepresented the thing to him. Allen, it appears,
acted for Miller, in taking, out the <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> for the
negroes, and also in Miller's trial on the indictment for
breaking the law of Indiana; both of which resulted in
Miller's favor. Upon quashing the proceedings in the last named case, 
Allen made a request of the judge that Miller should be remanded back
to jail, upon <hi rend="italics">his own</hi> request; that he probably had his own
reasons for such request. The judge told him that he did
not know that he had any right to do so—if he would show
him law for it, he would do so. Allen replied that he did not
know that he could—it was only Miller's request. The judge
complied. Allen gave it as a reason that he feared the violence of the
mob, as the whole place was in a high state of excitement.
While thus in jail, Gavitt came with his
<pb id="pickard408" n="408"/>
<hi rend="italics">telegraphic evidence</hi> and made the necessary oath to
have Miller apprehended, and remanded to Alabama, as a
fugitive from justice.</p>
                <p>Gavitt (who, it seems, had been into the jail, and tried to
extort a confession from the negroes), told me that he
stated to the court ('Squire Robinson), that he was aware
that the testimony of colored persons was not admitted by
law on such occasions, but wished to know if the court
would do him the favor to listen to the statement of the
boy Levin? He ('Squire R.) <hi rend="italics">said he would</hi>. The boy then
owned in answer to questions put to him, that he was the
slave of ’Master Kiernan,’ and that he had come with Miller
from South Florence, Ala. I asked Gavitt which he thought
had the most weight with the court, his affidavit or the
negro's statement? His reply was: ’The nigger's story <hi rend="italics">was
what done it</hi>.’ I went to see 'Squire Robinson, and asked
him to let me see the law by which Miller was remanded. He
said there was a law shown him at the time, but he could
not now tell what or where it was, as he kept no minute of
the proceedings.</p>
                <p>A great many other little incidents were narrated during
the four days that I was in Evansville, Princeton, and
Vincennes, that might be elicited by questions; but I have
given the most important, or at least that which I
considered so. From the feeling manifested, I saw it would
not be safe for me to go to Smithland to disinter the body,
so I wrote to Mr. Hodge for the verdict of the Coroner's
jury, and any other particulars as to identity which he might
be able to give. Have not yet received an answer.</p>

        <p>From these statements there can be no doubt that the
body taken from the Ohio river, near Smithland in irons,
and buried in irons, was the body of Seth Concklin. But of
the manner of his death, there is no direct evidence. Of all
the conjectures that may be formed, the least probable is,
that he was drowned in an attempt to escape. Daring as he
was, he was nevertheless a man of too much sagacity to
have dreamed of escaping by the water, cumbered as he
was with manacles. The most probable state of the case was that,
seeing how utterly hopeless the prospect was for him, if he
once entered the Southern country, he tore himself from
the savage clutch of cruel men, and threw himself upon the
mercy of God. The suspicion of foul play which is involuntarily awakened, is put at rest
by the consideration that his captors had no temptation to
murder him. They knew perfectly well their own Slave laws,
and must have been only too eager to carry him back alive
and make an example of him, to the terror of their slaves and of all who should
think of helping them to escape.</p>
        <p>Although he was buried as he was found, in chains, and
was branded with the name of “negro thief,” and his
captors exulted in their blood-stained rewards, yet in the
sight of Truth and of Heaven, he is joined to
the noble and heroic company of the martyrs, the martyrs
of Freedom and Humanity.</p>
