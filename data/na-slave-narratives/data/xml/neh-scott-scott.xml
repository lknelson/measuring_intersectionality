        <head>FOREWORD</head>
        <p>IN THE passing of a character so unique as Dr. Booker T.
Washington, many of us, his friends, were anxious that his
biography should be written by those best qualified to do
so. It is therefore a source of gratification to us of his own
race to have an account of Dr. Washington's career set
forth in a form at once accurate and readable, such as will
inspire unborn generations of Negroes and others to love
and appreciate all mankind of whatever race or color. It
is especially gratifying that this biography has been 
prepared by the two people in all America best fitted, by
antecedents and by intimate acquaintance and association
with Dr. Washington, to undertake it. Mr. Lyman
Beecher Stowe is the grandson of Harriet Beecher Stowe,
whose “Uncle Tom's Cabin” had a very direct influence on
the abolition of slavery, and Mr. Emmett J. Scott was Dr.
Washington's loyal and trusted secretary for eighteen
years.</p>

        <head>AUTHORS' PREFACE</head>
        <p>THIS is not a biography in the ordinary sense. The
exhaustive “Life and Letters of Booker T. Washington” 
remains still to be compiled. In this more modest work we
have simply sought to present and interpret the chief
phases of the life of this man who rose from a slave boy to
be the leader of ten millions of people and to take his place
for all time among America's great men. In fact, we have
not even touched upon his childhood, early training, and
education, because we felt the story of those early struggles 
and privations had been ultimately well told in his
own words in “Up from Slavery.” This autobiography,
however, published as it was fifteen years before his death,
brings the story of his life only to the threshold of his
greatest achievements. In this book we seek to give the
full fruition of his life's work. Each chapter is complete in
itself. Each presents a complete, although by no means
exhaustive, picture of some phase of his life.</p>
        <p>We take no small satisfaction in the fact that we were
personally selected by Booker Washington himself for this
task. He considered us qualified to produce what he
wanted: namely, a record of his struggles and achievements 
at once accurate and readable, put in permanent
form for the information of the public. He believed that
<pb id="washiviii" n="viii"/>
such a record could best be furnished by his confidential
associate, working in collaboration with a trained and 
experienced writer, sympathetically interested in the welfare
of the Negro race. This, then, is what we have tried to do
and the way we have tried to do it.</p>
        <p>We completed the first four chapters before Mr. 
Washington's death, but he never read them. In fact, it was
our wish, to which he agreed, that he should not read what
we had written until its publication in book form.</p>

        <head>PREFACE</head>
        <p>IT IS not hyperbole to say that Booker T. Washington was a
great American. For twenty years before his death he had
been the most useful, as well as the most distinguished, 
member of his race in the world, and one of the most 
useful, as well as one of the most distinguished, of 
American citizens of any race.</p>
        <p>Eminent though his services were to the people of his own
color, the white men of our Republic were almost as much
indebted to him, both directly and indirectly. They were
indebted to him directly, because of the work he did on behalf
of industrial education for the Negro, thus giving impetus to the
work for the industrial education of the White Man, which is, at
least, as necessary; and, moreover, every successful effort to
turn the thoughts of the natural leaders of the Negro race into
the fields of business endeavor, of agricultural effort, of every
species of success in private life, is not only to their advantage,
but to the advantage of the White Man, as tending to remove
the friction and trouble that inevitably come throughout the
South at this time in any Negro district where the Negroes turn
for their advancement primarily to political life.</p>
        <p>The indirect indebtedness of the White Race to Booker 
<pb id="washix" n="x"/>
T. Washington is due to the simple fact that here in America 
we are all in the end going up or down together; and 
therefore, in the long run, the man who makes a substantial 
contribution toward uplifting any part of the community 
has helped to uplift all of the community. Wherever in
our land the Negro remains uneducated, and liable to criminal
suggestion, it is absolutely certain that the whites will
themselves tend to tread the paths of barbarism; and wherever
we find the colored people as a whole engaged in successful
work to better themselves, and respecting both themselves and
others, there we shall also find the tone of the white
community high.</p>
        <p>The patriotic white man with an interest in the welfare
of this country is almost as heavily indebted to Booker T.
Washington as the colored men themselves.</p>
        <p>If there is any lesson, more essential than any other,
for this country to learn, it is the lesson that the enjoyment
of rights should be made conditional upon the performance
of duty. For one failure in the history of our country
which is due to the people not asserting their rights, there
are hundreds due to their not performing their duties.
This is just as true of the White Man as it is of the Colored
Man. But it is a lesson even more important to be taught
the Colored Man, because the Negro starts at the bottom
of the ladder and will never develop the strength to climb
even a single rung if he follow the lead of those who dwell
only upon their rights and not upon their duties. He has
a hard road to travel anyhow. He is certain to be treated
with much injustice, and although he will encounter
<pb id="washixi" n="xi"/>
among white men a number who wish to help him upward and
onward, he will encounter only too many who, if they do him
no bodily harm, yet show a brutal lack of consideration for
him. Nevertheless his one safety lies in steadily keeping in
view that the law of service is the great law of life, above all in
this Republic, and that no man of color can benefit either
himself or the rest of his race, unless he proves by his life his
adherence to this law. Such a life is not easy for the White
Man, and it is very much less easy for the Black Man; but it is
even more important for the Black Man, and for the Black
Man's people, that he should lead it.</p>
        <p>As nearly as any man I have ever met, Booker T. Washington
lived up to Micah's verse, “What more doth the Lord require to
thee than to do Justice and love Mercy and walk humbly with
thy God.” He did justice to every man. He did justice to those to
whom it was a hard thing to do justice. He showed mercy; and
this meant that he showed mercy not only to the poor, and to
those beneath him, but that he showed mercy by an
understanding of the shortcomings of those who failed to do him
justice, and failed to do his race justice. He always understood
and acted upon the belief that the Black Man could not rise if he
so acted as to incur the enmity and hatred of the White Man;
that it was of prime importance to the well-being of the Black
Man to earn the good will of his white neighbor, and that the bulk
of the Black Men who dwell in the Southern States must realize
that the White Men who are their immediate physical neighbors
<pb id="washixii" n="xii"/>
are beyond all others those whose good will and respect
it is of vital consequence that the Black Men of the South
should secure.</p>
        <p>He was never led away, as the educated Negro so often
is led away, into the pursuit of fantastic visions; into the
drawing up of plans fit only for a world of two dimensions.
He kept his high ideals, always; but he never forgot for a
moment that he was living in an actual world of three
dimensions, in a world of unpleasant facts, where those
unpleasant facts have to be faced; and he made the best
possible out of a bad situation from which there was no
ideal best to be obtained. And he walked humbly with
his God.</p>
        <p>To a very extraordinary degree he combined humility
and dignity; and I think that the explanation of this
extraordinary degree of success in a very difficult 
combination was due to the fact that at the bottom his humility
was really the outward expression, not of a servile attitude
toward any man, but of the spiritual fact that in very
truth he walked humbly with his God.</p>
        <p>Nowhere was Booker T. Washington's wisdom shown
better than in the mixture of moderation and firmness
with which he took precisely the right position as to the
part the Black Men should try to take in politics. He
put the whole case in a nut-shell in the following sentences:</p>
        <p>“In my opinion it is a fatal mistake to teach the young
black man and the young white man that the dominance
of the white race in the South rests upon any other basis
than absolute justice to the weaker man. It is a mistake
<pb id="washixiii" n="xiii"/>
to cultivate in the mind of any individual or group of
individuals the feeling and belief that their happiness
rests upon the misery of some one else, or their wealth by
the poverty of some one else. I do not advocate that the
Negro make politics or the holding of office an important
thing in his life. I do urge, in the interests of fair play
for everybody, that a Negro who prepares himself in
property, in intelligence, and in character to cast a ballot,
and desires to do so, should have the opportunity.”</p>
        <p>In other words, while he did not believe that political
activity should play an important part among Negroes as
a whole, he did believe that in the interests of the White,
as well as in the interests of the Colored, race, the upright,
honest, intelligent Black Man or Colored Man should be
given the right to cast a ballot if he possessed the qualities
which, if possessed by a White Man, would make that
White Man a valuable addition to the suffrage-exercising
class.</p>
        <p>No man, White or Black, was more keenly alive than
Booker T. Washington to the threat of the South, and to
the whole country, and especially to the Black Man 
himself, contained in the mass of ignorant, propertyless, 
semi-vicious Black voters, wholly lacking in the character which
alone fits a race for self-government, who nevertheless
have been given the ballot in certain Southern States.</p>
        <p>In my many conversations and consultations with him it
is, I believe, not an exaggeration to say that one-half the
time we were discussing methods for keeping out of office,
and out of all political power, the ignorant, semi-criminal,
<pb id="washixiv" n="xiv"/>
shiftless Black Man who, when manipulated by the able
and unscrupulous politician, Black or White, is so dreadful
a menace to our political institutions. But he felt very
strongly, and I felt no less strongly, that one of the most
efficient ways of warring against this evil type was to show
the Negro that, if he turned his back on that type, and
fitted himself to be a self-respecting citizen, doing his
part in sustaining the common burdens of good citizenship,
he would be freely accorded by his White neighbors the
privileges and rights of good citizenship. Surely there can
be no objection to this. Surely there can be no serious
objection thus to keep open the door of hope for the
thoroughly decent, upright, self-respecting man, no matter
what his color.</p>
        <p>In the same way, while Booker T. Washington firmly
believed that the attention of the Colored race should be
riveted, not on political life, but on success sought in the
fields of honest business endeavor, he also felt, and I agreed
with him, that it was to the interest of both races that
there should be appointments to office of Black Men whose
characters and abilities were such that if they were White
Men their appointments would be hailed as being well
above the average, and creditable from every standpoint.
He also felt, and I agreed with him, that it was essential
that these appointments should be made relatively most
numerous in the North—for it is worse than useless to
preach virtue to others, unless the preachers themselves
practise it; which means that the Northern communities,
which pride themselves on possessing the proper attitude
<pb id="washixv" n="xv"/>
toward the Negro, should show this attitude by their
own acts within their own borders.</p>
        <p>I profited very much by my association with Booker T.
Washington. I owed him much along many different
lines. I valued greatly his friendship and respect; and
when he died I mourned his loss as a patriot and an
American.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER ONE</head>
          <head>THE MAN AND HIS SCHOOL IN THE MAKING</head>
          <p>IT CAME about that in the year 1880, in Macon
County, Alabama, a certain ex-Confederate colonel 
conceived the idea that if he could secure the Negro vote he
could beat his rival and win the seat he coveted in the
State Legislature. Accordingly, the colonel went to the
leading Negro in the town of Tuskegee and asked him
what he could do to secure the Negro vote, for Negroes
then voted in Alabama without restriction. This man,
Lewis Adams by name, himself an ex-slave, promptly 
replied that what his race most wanted was education and
what they most needed was industrial education, and
that if he (the colonel) would agree to work for the 
passage of a bill appropriating money for the maintenance of
an industrial school for Negroes, he (Adams) would help to
get for him the Negro vote and the election. This bargain
between an ex-slaveholder and an ex-slave was made and
faithfully observed on both sides, with the result that the
following year the Legislature of Alabama appropriated
$2,000 a year for the establishment of a normal and 
industrial school for Negroes in the town of Tuskegee. On
the recommendation of General Armstrong of Hampton
Institute a young colored man, Booker T. Washington, a
<pb id="washi4" n="4"/>
recent graduate of and teacher at the Institute, was called
from there to take charge of this landless, buildingless,
teacherless, and studentless institution of learning.</p>
          <p>This move turned out to be a fatal mistake in the political 
career of the colonel. The appellation of “nigger
lover” kept him ever after firmly wedged in his political
grave. Thus, by the same stroke, was the career of an 
ex-slaveholder wrecked and that of an ex-slave made. This
political blunder of a local office-seeker gave to education
one of its great formative institutions, to the Negro race its
greatest leader, and to America one of its greatest citizens.</p>
          <p>One is tempted to feel that Booker T. Washington was
always popular and successful. On the contrary, for
many years he had to fight his way inch by inch against the
bitterest opposition, not only of the whites, but of his own
race. At that time there was scarcely a Negro leader of
any prominence who was not either a politician or a
preacher. In the introduction to “Up from Slavery,” Mr.
Walter H. Page says of his first experience many years ago
with Booker Washington: “I had occasion to write to him,
and I addressed him as ‘The Rev. Booker T. Washington.’
In his reply there was no mention of my addressing him as
a clergyman. But when I had occasion to write to him
again, and persisted in making him a preacher, his second
letter brought a postscript: ‘I have no claim to Rev.’ I
knew most of the colored men who at that time had become
prominent as leaders of their race, but I had not then
known one who was neither a politician nor a preacher; and
I had not heard of the head of an important colored school
<pb id="washi5" n="5"/>
who was not a preacher. ‘A new kind of man in the
colored world,’ I said to myself—‘a new kind of man
surely if he looks upon his task as an economic one instead
of a theological one.<corr>’</corr> ” </p>
          <p>And just because Booker Washington did look “upon
his task as an economic one instead of a theological one” he
was at first regarded with suspicion by most of the
preachers of his race and by some openly denounced as
irreligious and the founder of an irreligious school. Like
so many men of greater opportunity in all ages and places,
many of these Negro ministers confounded theology and
religion. Finding no theology about Booker Washington
or his school, they assumed there was no religion. Some
of them even went so far as to warn their congregations
from the pulpit to keep away from this Godless man and
his Godless school. To this formidable and at first almost
universal opposition from the leaders among his own
people was added the more natural opposition of the
neighboring white men who assumed that he was “spoiling
the niggers” by education. A youth with a high collar,
loud necktie, checked suit, and patent-leather shoes,
dangling a cane, smoking a cigarette, and loitering 
impudently on a street corner was their mental picture of an
educated Negro.</p>
          <p>Among the original group of thirty students with whom
Mr. Washington started Tuskegee Institute on an old
plantation equipped with a kitchen, a stable, and a 
hen-house, was a now elderly man who to-day has charge of the
spacious and beautiful grounds of the Institute. He was
<pb id="washi6" n="6"/>
approaching middle age when he entered this original
Tuskegee class. The following is a paraphrase of his 
account of the early days of the school: “After we'd been out
on the plantation three or four weeks Mr. Washington
came into the schoolroom and said: ‘To-morrow we're
going to have a chopping bee. All of you that have an axe,
or can borrow one, must bring it. I will try and provide
those of you who cannot furnish an axe. We will dismiss
school early to-morrow afternoon and start for the 
chopping bee.’ So we came to school next day with the axes, all
of us that could get them; we were all excited and eager
for that chopping bee, and we were all discussing what it
would be like, because we had never been to one before.
So in the afternoon Mr. Washington said it was time for
that chopping bee, so he put his axe over his shoulder and
led us to the woods and put us to work cutting the trees and
clearing the land. He went right in and worked harder
and faster and handled his axe better than any of us. After
a while we found that a chopping bee, as he called it, was no
different front just plain cutting down trees and clearing
the land. There wasn't anything new about that—we all
had had all we wanted of it. Some of the boys said they
didn't come to school to cut down trees and clear land, but
they couldn't say they were too good for that kind of work
when Mr. Washington himself was at it harder than any of
them. So he kept with us for some days till everybody
had his idea. Then he went off to do something more 
important.</p>
          <p>“Now, in those days he used to go off every Saturday
<pb id="washi7" n="7"/>
morning and he wouldn't come back till Monday morning.
He'd travel all round the country drumming up students
for the school and telling the people to send their children.
And on Sunday he'd get the preachers to let him get up in
their pulpits and tell the people about the school after they
had finished preaching. And the preachers would warn
their people against him and his school, because they said
it wasn't Methodist, and it wasn't Baptist, and it wasn't
Presbyterian, and it wasn't Episcopalian, and it wasn't
Christian. And they told the people to keep their children
away from that Godless man and his school. But when he
came along and asked to speak to the people they had to
leave him, just as everybody always did—let him do just
what he wanted to do. And when they heard him, the
people, they didn't pay no attention to the preachers, they
just sent their children as fast as ever they could contrive
it.</p>
          <p>“Now, in those days Mr. Washington didn't have a
horse, nor a mule, nor a wagon, and he wanted to cover
more country on those trips than he could afoot, so he'd
just go out in the middle of the road and when some old
black man would come along driving his mule wagon he'd
stop him and talk with him, and tell him about the school
and what it was going to do for the black folks, and then
he'd say: ‘Now, Uncle, you can help by bringing your
wagon and mule round at nine o'clock Saturday morning
for me to go off round the country telling the people about
the school. Now, remember, Uncle Jake, please be here
promptly at nine,’ and the old man would say, ‘Yes, boss,
<pb id="washi8" n="8"/>
I sure will be here!’ That was how he did it—when he
needed anything he'd go out and put his hand on it. First,
he could put his hand on anything he wanted round the
town; then, he could put his hand on anything he wanted
all over the county; then he could put his hand on 
anything he wanted all over the State; and then finally they do
tell me he could put his hand on anything he wanted away
up to New York.</p>
          <p>“In those days, after we came to live here on the
‘plantation,’ I used to take the wheelbarrow and go round
to the office when Mr. Washington opened up the mail in
the morning, and if there was money in the mail then I
could go along to the town with the wheelbarrow and get
provisions, and if there was no money then there was no
occasion to go to town, and we'd just eat what we had left.
Most of the white storekeepers wouldn't give us credit, and
they didn't want a ‘nigger school’ here anyhow. Times
have changed. Now those storekeepers get a large 
proportion of their trade here at the Institute, and if there
should be any talk of moving, they'd just get up and fight
to the last to keep us here and keep our trade.</p>
          <p>“And in those days the Negro preachers, or the most of
them, and the white folks, or the most of them, were 
always trying to dispute with Mr. Washington and quarrel
with him, but he just kept his mouth shut and went ahead.
He kept pleasant and he wouldn't dispute with them, nor
argue with them, nor quarrel with them. When the white
folks would come round and tell him he was ‘spoiling good
niggers by education,’ he would just ask them to wait
<pb id="washi9" n="9"/>
patiently and give him time to show them what the right kind of
education would do. And when the colored preachers would
come round and tell him he was no Christian, and his school
had no religion, he would ask them to just wait and see if the
boys and girls were any less Christian because of the
education they were getting. But whoever came along and
whatever happened Mr. Washington just kept his mouth shut
and went ahead.</p>
          <p>“After two years of school I went out and rented some land
and planted cotton, and just about time to harvest my crop Mr.
Washington sent for me one Saturday and said: ‘I need you. I
want you to come back and work for the school on the farm. I
want you to start in Monday morning.’ When I told him about
my cotton crop just ready to be picked he said: ‘Can't help that,
we need you. You'll have to arrange with your neighbors to
harvest your crop for you.’”</p>
          <p>To the inquiry, “Well, did you come?” the old man replied,
“Of course I did. When Mr. Washington said come I came
same as everybody did what he told them. I got a neighbor to
harvest my crop and I lost money on it, but I came to work
that Monday morning more than thirty years ago, and I've
been here ever since.”</p>
          <p>The idea of not doing what Mr. Washington wanted him to
do, or even arguing the matter, was evidently inconceivable to
this old man. He had always obeyed Mr. Washington just as
he had obeyed the laws of nature by sleeping and eating. That
is the kind of control which
<pb id="washi10" n="10"/>
Booker Washington always exercised over his fellow-workers. 
He accepted their implicit obedience as naturally
and simply as they gave it.</p>
          <p>As Mr. Page also points out in the introduction to “Up
from Slavery,” however humble Mr. Washington's origin
may have been, what might be termed his intellectual
pedigree was of the highest and finest. He may be called,
in fact, the spiritual grandson of the great Dr. Mark 
Hopkins of Williams College. Just as Samuel Armstrong was
perhaps the most receptive of Mark Hopkins' pupils, so
Booker Washington became the most receptive pupil of
Samuel Armstrong. As says Mr. Page: “To the formation 
of Mr. Washington's character, then, went the missionary 
zeal of New England, influenced by one of the
strongest personalities in modern education, and the 
wide-reaching moral earnestness of General Armstrong himself.”
In his autobiography Mr. Washington thus describes
General Armstrong's influence and the impression he made
upon him: “It has been my fortune to meet personally
many of what are called great characters, both in Europe
and America, but I do not hesitate to say that I never met
any man who, in my estimation, was the equal of General
Armstrong. Fresh from the degrading influences of the
slave plantation and the coal mines, it was a rare privilege
for me to be permitted to come into direct contact with
such a character as General Armstrong. I shall always 
remember that the first time I went into his presence he
made the impression upon me of being a perfect man; I
was made to feel that there was something about him that
<pb id="washi11" n="11"/>
was superhuman. It was my privilege to know the General
personally from the time I entered Hampton till he died, and
the more I saw of him the greater he grew in my estimation.
One might have removed from Hampton all the buildings,
classrooms, teachers, and industries, and given the men and
women there the opportunity of coming into daily contact with
General Armstrong, and that alone would have been a liberal
education. (This recalls President Garfield's definition of a
university when he said, ‘my idea of a university is a log with
Mark Hopkins on one end and a boy on the other.’) The older I
grow, the more I am convinced that there is no education
which one can get from books and costly apparatus that is
equal to that which can be gotten from contact with great men
and women. Instead of studying books so constantly, how I
wish that our schools and colleges might learn to study men
and things!”</p>
          <p>When the young man imbued with these ideas and fresh
from these influences found himself responsible for the
destinies of a studentless, teacherless, buildingless, and
landless school it is significant how he went to work to supply
these manifold deficiencies. First, he found a place in which to
open the school—a dilapidated shanty church, the A. M. E. Zion
Church for Negroes, in the town of Tuskegee. Next he went
about the surrounding countryside, found out exactly under 
what conditions the people were living and what their needs 
were, and advertised the school among the class of people 
whom he wanted to have attend it. After returning from these
<pb id="washi12" n="12"/>
experiences he said: “I saw more clearly than ever the 
wisdom of the system which General Armstrong had 
inaugurated at Hampton. To take the children of such
people as I had been among for a month, and each day give
them a few hours of mere book education, I felt would be
almost a waste of time.”</p>
          <p>Six weeks after the school was opened, on July 4, 1881, in
the shanty Methodist Church with thirty students, Miss
Olivia A. Davidson entered the school, the enrollment of
which had already grown to fifty, as assistant teacher.
She subsequently became Mrs. Washington. The school
then had students, a teacher, and a building such as it was,
but it had no land. It was succeeding in so far as teaching
these eager and knowledge hungry young people what could 
be learned from books, but little more. Mr. Washington 
found that about 85 per cent. of the Negroes of the
Gulf States lived on the land and were dependent upon
agriculture for their livelihood. Hence, he reasoned that
it was of supreme importance to teach them how to live on
the land to the best advantage. In order to teach the
students how to live on the land the school itself must have
land. About this time an old plantation near the town of
Tuskegee came upon the market. The school had no
money. Mr. Washington had no money, and the $2,000 a 
year from the State Treasury could be used only for the
payment of teachers. Accordingly Mr. Washington 
personally borrowed the $250, from a personal friend, necessary
to secure title to the land, and moved the school from the
shanty church to the comparative comfort of four aged
<figure id="ill1" entity="wash12"><p>Tuskegee in the making. Nothing delighted Mr.
Washington more than to see his students 
doing the actual work <lb/>of erecting the Tuskegee
Institute buildings. A group of students raising the roof of one of the buildings</p></figure>
<pb id="washi13" n="13"/>
cabins formerly used as the dining-room, kitchen, stable, and
hen-house of the plantation.</p>
          <p>And as soon as they were established in their new quarters
he organized the “chopping bee” already described and cleared
some of the land so that it could be used for crops. He did not
clear and plant this land to give his students agricultural
training. He did it for the purpose that all land was originally
cleared and planted—to get food. He, of course, realized that
the educational content of this work was great—greater than
any possible textbook exercises in the classroom. He then and
there began the long and difficult task of teaching his people
that physical work, and particularly farm work, if rightly done
was education, and that education was work. To secure the
acceptance of this truth by a race only recently emancipated
from over two hundred years of unrequited toil—a race that had
always regarded freedom from the necessity for work as an
indication of superiority—was not a hopeful task. To them
education was the antithesis of work. It was the magic elixir
which emancipated all those fortunate enough to drink of it
from the necessity for work.</p>
          <p>He also began to emphasize at this time his familiar dictum
that learning to do the common things of life in an uncommon
way was an essential part of real education. Probably the
reverse of this dictum, namely, learning to do the uncommon
things of life in a common way—would have more nearly
corresponded to the popular conception of education among
most Negroes and many whites.</p>
          <p>Mr. Washington later developed a brickyard where, 
<pb id="washi14" n="14"/>
after a series of failures sufficient to convince any ordinary
man of the hopelessness of the enterprise, they finally 
succeeded in baking creditable bricks which were used by the
students in the construction of buildings for the school.
He did not start this brickyard for the purpose of
vocational training any more than he started the farm
for agricultural training. He started it because they
needed bricks with which to build buildings in which to
live, just as he started the farm to raise food upon which to
live. He saw to it, however, that the brickyard was used
as an instrument of education and was never allowed to
degenerate into a mere brickyard and nothing more, just
as he saw to it that the farm was used as a means of education 
and was not allowed to degenerate into a mere farm and
nothing more. It was even more difficult to persuade the
students that the hard, heavy, dirty work of the brickyard
was education than it had been to persuade them that farm
work was education. Mr. Washington wasted no time in
arguing this point, however, but merely insisted that without 
bricks they could not put up proper buildings, and that
without buildings they could not have such a school as they
must have not only for themselves but for their race.</p>
          <p>So this originally landless, buildingless, studentless, and
teacherless school came eventually to have all four of these
obvious requisites, but it still lacked a fundamental 
requirement for the effective fulfillment of its purpose. It
lacked a boarding department where the students might
learn to live. In his tours among the people Mr. 
Washington had found the great majority in the plantation 
<figure id="ill2" entity="wash14"><p>Tuskegee Institute students laying
the foundation of one of the four Emery buildings—boys' dormitories</p></figure>
<pb id="washi15" n="15"/>
districts living on fat pork and corn bread, and sleeping in 
one-room cabins. They planted nothing but cotton, bought
their food at the nearest village or town market instead of
raising it, and lived under conditions where the fundamental 
laws of hygiene and decent social intercourse were
both unknown and impossible of application. The young
men and women from such homes must be taught how to
live in houses with more than one room, how to keep their
persons and their surroundings clean, how to sleep in a bed
between sheets, how not only to raise but to prepare, serve,
and eat a healthful variety of proper food at regular and
stated intervals, to say nothing of a trade by which to
maintain themselves both during their course and after
graduation as well as the usual book learning of the 
ordinary school. Obviously they could not be taught these
things unless they lived day and night on the school
grounds instead of boarding about with people whose
standards of living were very little if at all higher than
those of their homes. Accordingly volunteers were called
for, and the students made an excavation under their new
brick building which was made into a basement kitchen
and dining-room. As Mr. Washington says in “Up from
Slavery,” “We had nothing but the students and their 
appetites with which to begin a boarding department.” As
soon as this boarding department was established it became 
possible to influence directly the lives of the students
during the entire twenty-four hours of the day. From then
on each student was required to have and to use a 
toothbrush. Mr. Washington has since remarked that, in his
<pb id="washi16" n="16"/>
opinion, the toothbrush is the most potent single instrument 
of civilization. Then, too, it was possible for him to begin 
to enforce this injunction taken from one of his now well-known
Sunday night talks, “Make a study of the preparation 
of food. See to it that a certain ceremony, a certain 
importance, be attached to the partaking of the food——”
This exhortation sounds so commonplace as to be scarcely
noticed by the average reader, but just put yourself in the place
of one of these boys or girls who came from a one-room cabin
and realize what a profoundly revolutionary, even sensational,
injunction it is! To the boy or girl who had snatched a morsel of
food here, there, or anywhere when prompted by the gnawings
of hunger, who had never sat down to a regular meal, who had
never partaken of a meal placed upon a table with or without
ceremony—imagine what it meant to such a boy or girl “to see to
it that a certain ceremony, a certain importance, be attached to
the partaking of the food”—not on special occasions but at each
one of the three meals of each day!</p>
          <p>Finally it came about that this school which had started with a
paltry $2,000 a year, a great need, and the invincible
determination of one man, came to have land, buildings, teachers,
students, and even a boarding department. But in Mr.
Washington's view there was still a great fundamental lack in
their work. They were doing nothing directly to help those less
fortunate than themselves—those about them who could not come
and enjoy the advantages of the school. Mr. Washington held
that as soon as an individual got hold of anything as useful and
<figure id="ill3" entity="wash16"><p>Booker T. Washington “His influence, like that of his school, was at first
community wide, then county wide, then State
wide, and finally nation wide”</p></figure>
<pb id="washi17" n="17"/>
desirable as education he should take immediate means to
hand it on to the greatest possible number of those who
needed it. He had no patience with those persons who
would climb the tree of knowledge and then pull the ladder
up after them.</p>
          <p>He and his teachers then began to go out on Sundays and
give the people homely talks on how to improve their living
conditions. They encouraged the farmers to come to the
school farm and learn how to grow a variety of crops to
supplement the cotton crop which was their sole reliance.
They relieved the distress of individual families. Mrs.
Washington gathered together in an old loft the farmers'
wives and daughters who were in the habit of loafing about
the village of Tuskegee on Saturday afternoons and formed
them into a woman's club for the improvement of the 
living conditions in their homes and communities. Mr.
Washington and his teachers went right onto the farms and
into the homes, and into the churches and the schools, and
everywhere showed, for the most part by concrete 
object-lessons, how they could make their farms more productive,
their homes more comfortable, their schools more useful,
and their church services more inspiring. All this was
done not with an idea of starting an extension department
or a social service department, but merely because these
people needed help, and Mr. Washington knew that both
teachers and students would help themselves in helping
them. Finally, chiefly through the efforts of Mrs. 
Washington, a model country school was established in the
district adjoining the Institute's property. This school is
<pb id="washi18" n="18"/>
a farm home where the young teacher and his wife, both
graduates of Tuskegee, teach the boys and girls who come
to them each day how to live on a farm—teach them by
practice and object-lesson as well as by precept. They
follow the ordinary country school curriculum, but that is a
small and relatively unimportant part of what this school
gives its pupils. Then, too, the teachers of Tuskegee early
started campaigns looking to the extending of the school
terms throughout Macon County and the adjoining counties 
from three to five months, as was customary, to nine
months.</p>
          <p>And this work of Tuskegee beyond its own borders grew
as constantly in volume and extent as the work within its
borders, so that Tuskegee soon became the vital force—
the yeast that was raising the level of life and well-being
throughout, first, the town and neighborhood of Tuskegee,
then the County of Macon, then the surrounding counties
and the State of Alabama; and finally, in conjunction with
its mother, Hampton, and its children situated at strategic
points throughout the South, the entire Negro people of the
South, and indirectly the whole nation.</p>
          <p>And as the school grew, so grew the man whose life was
its embodiment. It is impossible to think of Booker
Washington and Tuskegee separately. Just as he typified
Tuskegee, so Tuskegee typified him. Just as he made
the school, so the school made him. His influence, like that
of his school, was at first community wide, then county
wide, then State wide, and finally nation wide.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER TWO</head>
          <head>LEADER OF HIS RACE</head>
          <p>IN 1895, fourteen years after the founding of Tuskegee
Institute, Booker T. Washington was selected to
represent his race at the opening of the Cotton States
and International Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia. On
this occasion he mounted the platform, to make the first
address which any member of his race had ever made 
before any representative body of Southern men and women,
as an obscure but worthy young colored man who had 
commended himself to a few thinking persons by building up
an excellent industrial school for his people. He came off
that platform amid scenes of almost hysterical enthusiasm
and was thenceforth proclaimed as the leader of his race,
the Moses of his people, and one of America's great men.</p>
          <p>In this epoch-making speech Booker Washington had
presented a solution of an apparently insoluble problem.
He had offered a platform upon which, as Clark Howell
said in the Atlanta <hi rend="italics">Constitution</hi>, “both races, blacks and
whites, could stand with full justice to each.” In the
course of the speech he told this story: “A ship lost at sea
for many days suddenly sighted a friendly vessel. From
the mast of the unfortunate vessel was seen a signal:
‘Water, water; we die of thirst!’ The answer from the
<pb id="washi20" n="20"/>
friendly vessel at once came back: ‘Cast down your bucket
where you are.’ A second time the signal, ‘Water, water, send
us water!’ ran up from the distressed vessel, and was
answered: ‘Cast down your bucket where you are.’ And a third
and fourth signal for water was answered, ‘Cast down your
bucket where you are.’ The captain of the distressed vessel, at
last heeding the injunction, cast down his bucket, and it came
up full of fresh, sparkling water from the mouth of the Amazon
River.” He then appealed to his own people to “cast down their
buckets where they were” by making friends with their white
neighbors in every manly way, by training themselves where
they were in agriculture, in mechanics, in commerce, instead of
trying to better their condition by migration. And finally to the
Southern white people he appealed “to cast down their buckets
where they were” by using and training the Negroes whom
they knew rather than seeking to import foreign laborers whom
they did not know.</p>
          <p>When he reached the crux and climax of the speech—the
delicate matter of the relations between the races, socially
—he held up his right hand with his fingers outstretched 
and said: “In all things that are purely social we can be as 
separate as the fingers, yet one as the hand in all things 
essential to mutual progress.” At this remark the 
audience went wild! Ladies stood on their chairs and waved 
their handkerchiefs, while men threw up their hats, danced, 
and catcalled. An old ante-bellum Negro, who had been 
sitting crosslegged in one of the aisles, wept tears of pride
<pb id="washi21" n="21"/>
and joy as he swayed from side to side. By this statement, 
with what had led up to it, Booker Washington captured 
the allegiance of all really representative Southern
whites, and by consistently adhering to this position he, in
an ever-increasing degree, won and held their allegiance
till the end.</p>
          <p>Frederick Douglass, the great leader of his race during
the closing days of slavery, during the War and the 
Reconstruction period, had died only a few months before.
Everywhere, by leading whites, as well as blacks, 
Washington was acclaimed as the successor of Douglass—the new
leader of the Negro race. One of the first colored men so
to acclaim him was Emmett J. Scott, who was then editing
a Negro newspaper in Houston, Texas, and little realized
that he was to become the most intimate associate of the
new leader. In an editorial Mr. Scott said of this 
address: “Without resort to exaggeration, it is but simple
justice to call the address great. It was great! Great, in
that it exhibited the speaker's qualities of head and heart;
great in that he could and did discriminately recognize 
conditions as they affect his people, and greater still in the
absolute modesty, self-respect, and dignity with which he
presented a platform upon which, as Clark Howell, of the
Atlanta <hi rend="italics">Constitution</hi> says: ‘both races, blacks and whites,
can stand with full justice to each.’” Perhaps the most
remarkable feature of Booker Washington's leadership
was that from that time on he never deviated one hair's
breadth in word or deed from the platform laid down in
this brief address.</p>
          <pb id="washi22" n="22"/>
          <p>It was not to be expected, however, that such a radically
new note in Negro leadership could be struck without some
discord. As was perfectly natural, some more or less
prominent Negroes, whose mental processes followed the
lines of cleavage between the races engendered by the 
embittering experiences of the Reconstruction period, looked
with suspicion upon a Negro leader who had won the 
approbation of the South, of leading white citizens, press, and
public. In the days of slavery it was a frequent custom on
large plantations to use one of the slaves as a kind of stool
pigeon to spy upon the others and report their misdeeds.
Naturally such persons were hated and despised and looked
upon as traitors to their race. Hence, it came about that
the praise of a white man was apt to throw suspicion upon
the racial loyalty of a black man. This habit of mind, like
all mental habits, long survived the system and circumstances
which occasioned it. Therefore, it was inevitable
that the fact that the white press throughout the South
rang with his praises for days and weeks after the 
sensationally enthusiastic reception of his speech at the 
exposition should not be accepted as a desirable endorsement
of the new leader by at least a few of his own people.</p>
          <p>A more or less conspicuous colored preacher summed up
this slight undertow of dissent when he said: “I want to
pay my respects next to a colored man. He is a great man,
too, but he isn't our Moses, as the white people are pleased
to call him. I allude to Booker T. Washington. He has
been with the white people so long that he has learned to
throw sop with the rest. He made a speech at Atlanta the
<pb id="washi23" n="23"/>
other day, and the newspapers of all the large cities praised 
it and called it the greatest speech ever delivered by a 
colored man. When I heard that, I said: ‘There must be
something wrong with it, or the white people would not be
praising it so.’ I got the speech and read it. Then I said,
‘Ah, here it is,’ and I read his words, ‘the colored people do 
not want social equality.’ (This man's interpretation of 
this sentence in the speech, “The wisest among my race
understand that the agitation of questions of social 
equality is the extremest folly, and that progress in the 
enjoyment of all the privileges that will come to us must be 
the result of severe and constant struggle rather than of 
artificial forcing.”) I tell you that is a lie. We do want 
social equality. Why, don't you want your manhood 
recognized? Then Mr. Washington said that our emancipation 
and enfranchisement were untimely and a mistake; 
that we were not ready for it. (Naturally, Mr. Washington 
said no such thing.) What did he say that for but to
tickle the palates of the white people? Oh, yes, he was 
shrewd. He will get many hundreds of dollars for his 
school by it.”</p>
          <p>Let it not be thought that this attitude represented any large
or important body of opinion among the Negroes. The great
majority both of the leaders and the rank and file
enthusiastically accepted both the new leader and his new kind
of leadership. The small minority, however, holding the view of
the preacher quoted, continued to cause Booker Washington
some annoyance, which, although continuously lessening,
persisted in some 
<pb id="washi24" n="24"/>
degree throughout his life. This numerically small and 
individually unimportant element of the Negroes in 
America would hardly warrant even passing mention 
except that the always carping and sometimes bitter criticisms 
of these persons are apt to confuse the well-wishers 
of the race who do not understand the situation.</p>
          <p>The Negroes holding this point of view are sometimes
pleased to refer to themselves as the Talented Tenth. They are
largely city dwellers who have had more or less of what they
term “higher education”—Latin, Greek, Theology, and the like. A
number of these persons make all or a part of their living by
publicly bewailing the wrongs and injustices of their race and
demanding their redress by immediate means. Mr.
Washington's emphasis upon the advantages of Negroes in
America and the debt of gratitude which they owe to the
whites, who have helped them to make more progress in fifty
years than any other race ever made in a like period, is
naturally very annoying to this type of person. In spite of their
constant abuse of him Mr. Washington some years ago agreed
to confer with the leaders of this faction to see if a program
could not be devised through which all could work together
instead of at cross purposes. In spite of the fact that the chief
exponent of this group opened the first meeting with a bitter
attack upon Mr. Washington, such a program was adopted, to
which, before the conferences were over, all duly and amicably
agreed to adhere. Some of the more restless spirits among the
leaders of the Talented Tenth soon, however, broke their
pledges, 
<pb id="washi25" n="25"/>
repudiated the whole arrangement, and started in as before to
denounce Mr. Washington and those who thought and
acted with him.</p>
          <p>After the Atlanta speech Mr. Washington's task was a
dual one. While the active head of his great and rapidly
growing institution, he was also the generally accepted
leader of his race. It is with his leadership of his race
that we are concerned in this chapter. His duties in this
capacity were vast and ill defined, and his responsibility
exceedingly heavy. He said, himself, that when he
first came to be talked of as the leader of his race he was
somewhat at a loss to know what was expected of him
in that capacity. His tasks in this direction, however,
were thrust upon him so thick and fast that he had not long
to remain in this state of mind. After the Atlanta speech
he was in almost daily contact with what was befalling his
people in all parts of the country and to some extent all
over the world. Through his press clipping service, 
supplemented by myriads of letters and personal reports,
practically every event of any significance to his race came
to his notice. When he heard of rioting, lynching, or
serious trouble in any community he sent a message of
advice, encouragement, or warning to the leading Negroes
of the locality and sometimes to the whites whom he knew
to be interested in the welfare of the Negroes. When the
trouble was sufficiently serious to warrant it he went in
person to the scene. When he heard of a Negro winning a
prize at a county fair, or being placed in some position of
unusual trust and distinction, he wrote him a letter of 
<pb id="washi26" n="26"/>
congratulation and learned the circumstances so that he might
cite the incident by way of encouragement to others.</p>
          <p>After the riots in Atlanta, Georgia, some years ago, when
infuriated white mobs foiled in their efforts to lynch a
Negro murderer, burned, killed, and laid waste right and
left in the Negro section of the town, Mr. Washington, who
was in the North at the time, boarded the first train for the
city, arrived just after the bloody scenes, gathered together
his frightened people amid the smoking ruins of their
homes, soothed, calmed, and cheered them. He then went
to the leading city officials, secured from them a promise of
succor for the stricken people and protection against
further attack. Next he went to the Governor of the
State, secured his sympathy and coöperation, and with
him organized a conference of leading State and city
officials and other representative men who there and then
mapped out a program tending to prevent the recurrence
of such race riots—a program which up to the present time
has successfully fulfilled its purpose. It is characteristic
of Mr. Washington's methods that he turned this disaster
into an ultimate blessing for the very community that was
afflicted.</p>
          <p>Mr. Washington was the kind of leader who kept very
close to the plain people. He knew their every-day lives,
their weaknesses, their temptations. To use a slang
phrase, he knew exactly what they “were up against”
whether they lived in country or city. Within a 
comparatively short period before his death he addressed two
audiences as widely separated by distance and environment
<pb id="washi27" n="27"/>
as the farmers gathered together for the first Negro
Fair of southwestern Georgia at Albany, Georgia, and five
thousand Negro residents of New York City assembled
in the Harlem Casino. He told those Georgia farmers
how much land they owned and to what extent it was
mortgaged, how much land they leased, how much cotton
they raised, and how much of other crops they raised, or,
rather, did not raise; how many mules and hogs they
owned, and how they could with profit increase their
ownership in mules and hogs; he told them how many
drug stores, grocery stores, and banks in the State and
county were owned by Negroes; and then, switching from
the general to the particular, he described the daily life of
the ordinary, easy-going tenant farmer of the locality. He
pictured what he saw when he came out of his unpainted
house in the morning: that gate off the hinges, that
broken window-pane with an old coat stuck into it, that
cotton planted right up to the doors with no room left for a
garden, and no garden; and, worse than all, the uncomfortable 
knowledge of debts concealed from the hard-working
wife and mother. Then he pictured what that same man's
place might be and should become.</p>
          <p>It was once said of a certain eminent preacher that his
logic was on fire. It might be said of Booker Washington
that his statistics were on fire. He marshalled them in
such a way that they were dynamic and stirring instead of
static and paralyzing, as we all know them to our sorrow.
It so happened that Mr. Washington had never before been
in southwestern Georgia. After his speech one old farmer
<pb id="washi28" n="28"/>
was heard to say as he shook his head: “I don't understan'
it! Booker T. Washington he ain't never ben here befo',
yit he knows mo' 'bout dese parts an' mo' 'bout us den what
eny of us knows ourselves.” This old man did not know
that one of Mr. Washington's most painstaking and
efficient assistants, Mr. Monroe N. Work, the editor of the
<hi rend="italics">Negro Year Book</hi>, devoted much of his time to keeping his
chief provided with this startlingly accurate information
about his people in every section of the United States.</p>
          <p>On this occasion there were on the platform with Mr.
Washington and the officials of the fair the Mayor of
Albany and members of the City Council, while in the
audience were several hundred whites on one side of the
centre aisle and twice as many blacks on the other. And
Mr. Washington would alternately address himself to his
white and black audience. He would, for instance, turn to
the white men and tell them that he had never known a
particularly successful black man who could not trace his
original success to the aid or encouragement he had 
received in one form or another from a white friend. He
would tell them that without their assistance his race could
never have made more progress in the last fifty years in this
country than any similar group of people had ever made in
a like period of time. After he had raised the white
section of his audience to a high degree of self-congratulatory 
complaisance he would suddenly shift the tenor of his
remarks and ask them why they should mar this splendid
record by discriminating against the weaker race in 
matters of education, by destroying their confidence in the
<pb id="washi29" n="29"/>
justice of the courts through mob violence, and by the
numerous small, mean ways in which race prejudice shows
itself and retards and discourages the upward struggle of a
weaker people. As he proceeded along these lines one
could see the self-congratulatory expression fade from the
faces of his white listeners.</p>
          <p>He would next turn to his own people and tell them of
their phenomenal progress since emancipation and of the
great and essential part they had played in the upbuilding
of the South—left prostrate by the Civil War. One could
see their eager, upturned faces glow with pride and 
self-satisfaction. But suddenly he would shift the tone of his
comments and tell them how sadly those of them who were
indolent and shiftless and unreliable and vicious were 
retarding the upward struggles of the industrious and 
self-respecting majority and how they were perpetuating the
prejudice against the whole race. And as he pictured this
seamy side of the situation one could see the glow of pride
gradually wilt from the myriads of swarthy upturned
faces.</p>
          <p>Hardly less successful than his use of statistics was his
use of the much-abused funny story. He never told a
story, however good, for its own sake. He told it only
when it would most effectively drive home whatever point
he happened to be making. In this same speech he was
saying that a Negro who is lazy and unreliable and does
nothing to accumulate property or improve his earning
capacity deserves no consideration from whites or blacks
and has no right to say that the color line is drawn against
<pb id="washi30" n="30"/>
him. By way of illustration he told this story: “A shiftless 
Southern poor white asked a self-respecting old black
man for three cents with which to pay his ferry fare across
a river. The old black man replied: ‘I's sorry not to 
commerdate yer, boss, but der fac' is dat a man what ain't got
three cents is jest as bad off on one side ob der ribber as der
udder.’”</p>
          <p>At another point in this speech he was telling his people
not to be discouraged because their race has less to point to
than other races in the way of past achievements. He said
that after all it was the future that was of vital concern and
not the past, and that the future was theirs to a peculiar
degree because they were a young race. And to illustrate
their situation he told of meeting old Aunt Caroline one
evening striding along with a basket on her head. He said,
“Where are you going, Aunt Caroline?” And she replied: 
“Lor' bless yer, Mister Washin'ton, I dun bin where
I's er goin'.” “And so,” he concluded, “some of the
races of the earth have dun bin where dey was er goin'!”
but fortunately the Negro race was not among them.</p>
          <p>In making the point that, in spite of race prejudice, the
handicaps to which his people were subjected in the South
were after all superficial and did not interfere with their
chance to work and earn a living, he told the experience of
an old Negro who was accompanying him on one of his
Southern educational tours. At a certain city they were
obliged to wait several hours between trains, so this old
man took advantage of the opportunity to stroll about and
see the sights of the place. After a while he pulled out his
<pb id="washi31" n="31"/>
watch and found he had barely time to get back to the
station before the train was due to leave. Accordingly he
rushed to a hack stand and called out to the first driver he
came to, who happened to be a white man: “Hurry up an'
take me to the station, I's gotta get the 4:32 train!” To
which the white hack driver replied: “I ain't never drove
a nigger in my hack yit an' I ain't goin' ter begin now.
You can git a nigger driver ter take ye down!”</p>
          <p>To this the old colored man replied with perfect good
nature: “All right, my frien', we won't have no misunderstanding or trouble; I'll tell you how we'll settle it: you
jest hop in on der back seat an' do der ridin' and I'll set in
front an' do der drivin'.” In this way they reached the
station amicably and the old man caught his train. Like
this old Negro, Mr. Washington always devoted his
energies to catching the train, and it made little difference
to him whether he sat on the front or the back seat.</p>
          <p>A few months later, to the five thousand people of his
own race in the Harlem Casino in New York City, he 
described their daily lives, their problems, perplexities, and
temptations in terms as homely, as picturesque, and as
vivid as he used in talking to the Georgia farmers. He
urged them, just as he did the farmers, to stop moving
about and to settle down—“to stop <hi rend="italics">staying</hi> here and there
and everywhere and begin to <hi rend="italics">live</hi> somewhere.” He urged
them to leave the little mechanical job of window washing,
or what not, and go into business for themselves, even if
they could only afford a few newspapers or peanuts to start
with. He told of a certain New York street where he had
<pb id="washi32" n="32"/>
found all the people on one side of a row of push carts were
selling something, while all the people on the other side
were buying something. Those that were selling were
white people, while those that were buying were colored
people. That, he said, was a color line they had drawn
themselves. He reminded them of the high cost of living,
and by way of example he commented upon the expense
of having to buy so many shoes. He said: “Up here you
not only have to have good, expensive shoes, but you have
to wear them all the time.” And then he reminded them
how back in the country down South, before they came to
the city, they would buy a pair of shoes at Christmas and
after Christmas put them away in the “chist” and not take
them out again until “big meeting day,” and then wear
them only in the meeting and not walking to and from the
church. And as he concluded with the words, “Under
those conditions shoes last a long time,” people all over the
audience were chuckling and nudging and winking at one
another as people will when characteristic incidents in their
past lives are graphically recalled to them.</p>
          <p>Then he described the almost innumerable temptations
to spend money which the city offers. Some of the store
windows are so enticing that, as he said, “the dollars 
almost jump out of your pockets as you go by on the 
sidewalk.” “Then you men working for rich men here in the
city smell the smoke of so many twenty-five-cent cigars
that after a while you feel as though you must smoke
twenty-five-cent cigars. You don't stop to think that
when the grandfathers of those very men first came from
<figure id="ill4" entity="wash32"><p>A study in black. Note the tensity of expression
with which the group is following his each and
every word</p></figure>
<pb id="washi33" n="33"/>
the country a hundred years ago they smoked two-for-five
cigars.” Then he told of a family he had found living on
the tenth story of an electric-lighted, steam-heated apartment 
house with elevator service, and this very family only
two years before was living in a two-room cabin in the
Yazoo Valley on the Mississippi bottoms. And he 
commented: “Now, that family's in danger. No people can
change as much and as fast as that without great danger!”</p>
          <p>Next he touched on the high rents and said: “You
mothers know that sooner or later you have to take in
roomers to help pay that rent, and after a while you take in
Tom, Dick, or Harry, or anybody who's got the money 
regardless of who or what they are, and you mothers know
the danger that spells for your daughters.” (At this point
he was interrupted by a chorus of “amens” from women
all over the great hall.) He continued: “Now, you take
the ‘old man’ aside an' tell him straight, you're not going
to have any more roomers hanging round your house—
that he's got to hustle for a better job or go into some little
business for himself, or move out into some little cottage in
the country, or do something to get rid of those Tom, Dick,
and Harry roomers.”</p>
          <p>In short, in this speech Mr. Washington showed that he
knew just as intimately the lives of his people in the flats of
Greater New York as on the farms of southwestern
Georgia.</p>
          <p>In spite of his grasp of details Mr. Washington never
became so immersed in them as to lose sight of his ultimate
goal, and conversely he never became so blinded by the
<pb id="washi34" n="34"/>
vision of his ultimate goal as to overlook details. The 
solution of the so-called Negro problem in America, he felt,
is to be found along these lines: As his people have more 
and more opportunity for training and become better and 
better trained they become more and more self-sufficient. 
They are developing their own carpenters, masons, blacksmiths, 
farmers, merchants, and bankers as well as lawyers, teachers,
preachers, and physicians. These trained people naturally, for
the most part, serve their own race, and to them the members
of the race naturally turn for the service that each is equipped
to render. As they acquire wealth, education, and
cultivation, the persons possessing these advantages naturally
intermingle socially and build up a society from which the
rough, ignorant, and uncouth of their own race are as inevitably
excluded as are such persons from all polite social intercourse
of whatever people. These Negroes of education and
cultivation no more desire to force themselves into the society
of the other race than do any persons of real education and
cultivation desire to go where they are not wanted. As the
race increases in wealth and culture it becomes more and more
easy and natural for its successful members to satisfy their
social desires and ambitions in their own society. Already in the
centres of Negro prosperity and culture it would be almost, if
not quite, as impossible for a white man to be received into the
best Negro society as it would for a Negro to be received into
the best white society. This growing independence and 
self-sufficiency in the trades, the professions, and social 
intercourse leads
<pb id="washi35" n="35"/>
inevitably, as he pointed out, to a form of natural segregation 
based upon economic needs and social preferences,
and in conformity to the laws of nature, which is a very
different matter from the artificial and arbitrary segregation 
forced upon unwilling people by the laws of men.
Under these conditions the disputes as to whether the
best society of the blacks is inferior or superior to the best
society of the whites becomes as academic and futile as
would be similar contentions as to whether the best society
of Constantinople is inferior or superior to that of Boston.</p>
          <p>While Negroes are more and more drawing apart from
the whites into their own section of the city, town, or
county they nevertheless find it a source of strength to live
near the whites in order that they may have the benefit of
their aid in those matters in which the older and stronger
race excels. Nor is this an entirely one-sided advantage,
as there are not a few matters in which the Negroes have
natural advantages over the whites and hence may render
them useful service. Thus the two races, socially 
separated but economically interdependent, may to mutual
advantage live side by side.</p>
          <p>Some persons claim that any such plan of race adjustment, 
while theoretically plausible and ideally desirable, is
nevertheless practically impossible. They contend that
no so radically different races have ever lived side by side
in harmony and each aiding the other. However that may
be, there remains the fact that such a harmonious and
mutually helpful relationship between the two races does
already exist in the town of Tuskegee, throughout Macon
<pb id="washi36" n="36"/>
County, and in many other of the more progressive 
localities throughout the South to-day. And at the same
time, the lynchings and riots and other manifestations of
racial conflict are continuously if slowly growing less 
frequent. Whatever may be the relative strength of the two
theories, the facts are lining up in support of the Booker
Washington prophecy at the Atlanta Exposition when he
said: “In all things that are purely social we can be as
separate as the fingers, yet one as the hand in all things
essential to mutual progress.”</p>
          <p>During the last twenty years of his life Mr. Washington
came more and more to be regarded as the representative
and spokesman of his race, and was invited to represent
and speak for them at such national and international
gatherings as the annual conventions of the National
Negro Business League, of which he was the president and
founder; the great meeting in honor of the brotherhood of
man, held in Boston in 1897; the Presbyterian rally for
Home Missions, at which President Grover Cleveland
presided; the International Sunday-school Convention
held in Chicago in 1914; the meeting of the National
Educational Association in St. Louis in 1904; the 
Thanksgiving Peace Jubilee in the Chicago Auditorium at the close
of the war with Spain in 1898, with President McKinley and
his Cabinet in attendance; the Commencement exercises
at Harvard in 1896, when President Eliot conferred upon
him the degree of Master of Arts; the International 
Conference on the Negro, held at Tuskegee in 1912, with 
representatives present from Europe, Africa, the West Indies,
<pb id="washi37" n="37"/>
and South America, as well as all sections of the United
States. Dartmouth College conferred his Doctorate upon
him in 1901.</p>
          <p>At Harvard in 1896 President Eliot, with these words,
conferred upon Mr. Washington the first honorary degree
ever conferred by a great university upon an American
Negro: “Teacher, wise helper of his race; good servant of
God and country.” In his speech delivered at the Alumni
Dinner on the same day Mr. Washington brought this
message to Harvard: “If through me, an humble 
representative, seven millions of my people in the South might
be permitted to send a message to Harvard—Harvard that
offered up on death's altar young Shaw, and Russell, and
Lowell, and scores of others, that we might have a free and
united country—that message would be: ‘Tell them that
the sacrifice was not in vain. Tell them that by the way
of the shop, the field, the skilled hand, habits of thrift and
economy, by way of industrial school and college, we are
coming. We are crawling up, working up, yea, bursting
up. Often through oppression, unjust discrimination, and
prejudice, but through them all we are coming up, and
with proper habits, intelligence, and property, there is no
power on earth that can permanently stay our progress!’”</p>
          <p>The next year at the great meeting in honor of the
brotherhood of man held in Music Hall, Boston, which 
concluded with the unveiling of the monument of Robert
Gould Shaw, Booker Washington in concluding his 
address turned to the one-armed color bearer of Colonel
Shaw's regiment and said: “To you, to the scarred and
<pb id="washi38" n="38"/>
scattered remnants of the Fifty-fourth, who with empty
sleeve and wanting leg have honored this occasion with
your presence—to you, your commander is not dead.
Though Boston erected no monument, and history 
recorded no story, in you and the loyal race which you 
represent Robert Gould Shaw will have a monument which
time cannot wear away.”</p>
          <p>In his speech at the Peace Jubilee exercises after the war
with Spain, Mr. Washington said: “When you have gotten
the full story of the heroic conduct of the Negro in the
Spanish-American War—heard it from the lips of Northern
soldiers and Southern soldiers, from ex-abolitionist and 
ex-master—then decide within yourselves whether a race that
is thus willing to die for its country should not be given the
highest opportunity to live for its country.” And again in
the same speech, after rehearsing the successes of American
arms, he said: “We have succeeded in every conflict, 
except the effort to conquer ourselves in the blotting out of
racial prejudices. . . . Until we thus conquer ourselves, 
I make no empty statement when I say that we
shall have, especially in the Southern part of our country, a
cancer gnawing at the heart of the Republic that shall one
day prove as dangerous as an attack from an army without
or within.” Note this as the language of a man on a great
national occasion who has been accused of a time-serving
acquiescence in the injustices which his race suffers!</p>
          <p>In his address before the National Educational Association 
in St. Louis, in 1904, he made the following remarks
which are typical of points he sought to emphasize when
<pb id="washi39" n="39"/>
addressing audiences of white people: “Let me free your
minds, if I can, from possible fear and apprehension in two
directions: the Negro in this country does not seek, as a
race, to exercise political supremacy over the white man,
nor is social intermingling with any race considered by the
Negro to be one of the essentials to his progress. You
may not know it, but my people are as proud of their
racial identity as you are of yours, and in the degree that
they become intelligent, racial pride increases. I was
never prouder of the fact that I am classed as a Negro than
I am to-day. . . . I can point you to groups of my people 
in nearly every part of our country that in intelligence 
and high and unselfish purpose of their school and
church life, and in the purity and sweetness of their home
life and social intercourse, will compare favorably with the
races of the earth. You can never lift any large section of
people by continually calling attention to their weak
points. A race, like a child in school, needs encouragement 
as well as chastisement.”</p>
          <p>In his address before the annual session of 1914 of the
National Negro Business League at Muskogee, Oklahoma,
Mr. Washington made the following remarks which are
typical of his points of chief emphasis in addressing his own
people: “Let your success thoroughly eclipse your shortcomings. 
We must give the world so much to think and talk
about that relates to our constructive work in the direction
of progress that people will forget and overlook our failures
and shortcomings. . . . One big, definite fact in the 
direction of achievement and construction will go farther in
<pb id="washi40" n="40"/>
securing rights and removing prejudice than many printed
pages of defense and explanation. . . . Let us in the future
spend less time talking about the part of the city that we
cannot live in, and more time in making that part of the city
that we can live in beautiful and <sic corr="attractive.&quot;">attractive.</sic></p>
          <p>It is characteristic of the kind of criticism to which Mr.
Washington was subjected that a certain element of the Negro
press violently denounced this comment as an indirect
endorsement of the legal segregation of Negroes. Probably the
last article written by Mr. Washington for any publication was
the one published posthumously by the <hi rend="italics">New Republic</hi>, New
York City, December 4, 1915, entitled, “My View of
Segregation Laws,” in which he stated in no uncertain terms
his views on the segregation laws which were being passed in
the South. In concluding his article, he said:</p>
          <p>“Summarizing the matter in the large, segregation is
ill-advised because:</p>
          <p>1. It is unjust.</p>
          <p>2. It invites other unjust measures.</p>
          <p>3. It will not be productive of good, because practically
every thoughtful Negro resents its injustice and doubts its
sincerity. Any race adjustment based on injustice finally
defeats itself. The Civil War is the best illustration of what
results where it is attempted to make wrong right or seem to
be right.</p>
          <p>4. It is unnecessary.</p>
          <p>5. It is inconsistent. The Negro is segregated from his
<pb id="washi41" n="41"/>
white neighbor, but white business men are not prevented
from doing business in Negro neighborhoods.</p>
          <p>6. There has been no case of segregation of Negroes in
the United States that has not widened the breach between
the two races. Wherever a form of segregation exists it
will be found that it has been administered in such a way as
to embitter the Negro and harm more or less the moral
fibre of the white man. That the Negro does not express
this constant sense of wrong is no proof that he does not
feel it.</p>
          <p>“It seems to me that the reasons given above, if carefully 
considered, should serve to prevent further passage
of such segregation ordinances as have been adopted in
Norfolk, Richmond, Louisville, Baltimore, and one or two
cities in South Carolina.</p>
          <p>“Finally, as I have said in another place, as white and
black learn daily to adjust, in a spirit of justice and fair
play, these interests which are individual and racial, and
to see and feel the importance of those fundamental 
interests which are common, so will both races grow and
prosper. In the long run, no individual and no race can
succeed which sets itself at war against the common good;
for in the gain or loss of one race all the rest have equal
claim.”</p>
          <p>In concluding his Muskogee speech he said: “If there
are those who are inclined to be discouraged concerning
racial conditions in this country we have but to turn our
minds in the direction of the deplorable conditions in
Europe, growing largely out of racial bitterness and 
<pb id="washi42" n="42"/>
friction. When we contrast what has taken place there with the
peaceful manner in which black people and white people are
living together in this country, notwithstanding now and then
there are evidences of injustice and friction, which should
always be condemned, we have the greatest cause for
thanksgiving. Perhaps nowhere else in the world can be found
so many white people living side by side with so many of dark
skin in so much of peace and harmony as in the United States.”</p>
          <p>This concluding observation was particularly characteristic of
him. Somewhere, or somehow, he always turned to account all
significant events for weal or woe from the most trivial personal
happenings to the titanic world war.</p>
          <p>Like all great leaders, Booker Washington did the bulk of his
work quietly in his own office and not on dramatic historic
occasions before great audiences. He received every day, for
instance, a huge and varied mail which required not only industry
to handle, but much judgment, patience, and tact to dispose of
wisely and adequately. We will here mention and quote from a
sheaf of letters taken at random from his files which partially
illustrate the range of his interests and the variety of the calls
which were constantly made upon him.</p>
          <p>A railroad official in Colorado asked his opinion on the
question of separate schools for white and black children
apropos of a movement to amend the State constitution so as to
make possible such separate schools. In his reply Mr.
Washington said: “As a rule, colored people in the Northern
States are very much opposed to any plans for
<pb id="washi43" n="43"/>
separate schools, and I think their feelings in the matter
deserve consideration. The real objection to separate
schools, from their point of view, is that they do not like to
feel that they are compelled to go to one school rather than
the other. It seems as if it was taking away part of their
freedom. This feeling is likely to be all the stronger
where the matter is made a subject of public agitation.
On the other hand, my experience is that if this matter is
left to the discretion of the school officials it usually settles
itself. As the colored people usually live pretty closely
together, there will naturally be schools in which colored
students are in the majority. In that case, the process of
separation takes place naturally and without the necessity
of changing the constitution. If you make it a 
constitutional question, the colored people are going to be 
opposed to it. If you leave it simply an administrative
question, which it really is, the matter will very likely 
settle itself.”</p>
          <p>We next find a courteous reply to the letter of some poor
crank who wanted to secure his backing for a preparation
which he had concocted for taking the curl out of Negroes'
hair. Then comes a letter to a man who wants to know
whether it is true that the Negro race is dying out. To
him Mr. Washington quoted the United States census
figures for 1910, which indicate an increase of 11 3/10 per
cent. in the Negro population for the decade.</p>
          <p>Next, we come upon a letter written to a man who is
interested in an effort of the Freedman's Aid Society to
raise a half a million dollars for Negro schools in the South.
<pb id="washi44" n="44"/>
Since this letter so well describes an important phase of
Booker Washington's leadership we give it almost in full.
It was written in 1913 and runs thus:</p>
          <p>“I think the most interesting work that Tuskegee has
done in recent years is its work in rural schools in the
country surrounding the Institute. During the last five
or six years forty-seven school buildings have been erected
in Macon County by colored people themselves. At the
same time the school term has been lengthened in every
part of the county from five to eight months. This work
has been done under the direction of a supervising teacher
working in connection with the extension department of
the Institute.</p>
          <p>“Among other things that have been attempted to 
encourage the people to improve their schools has been a
model country school started in a community called
Rising Star, a few miles from the Institute. The school at
Rising Star is an example of the rural school that Tuskegee
is seeking to promote. It consists of a five-room frame
house in which the teachers—a Tuskegee graduate and his
wife—not only teach, but live. All the rooms are used by
the school children. In the kitchen they are taught to
cook, in the dining-room to serve a meal, in the bedroom to
make the beds. In the garden they are taught how to raise
vegetables, poultry, pigs, and cows. They recite in the
sitting-room or on the veranda, and their lessons all deal
with matters of their own every-day life. . . . Instead 
of figuring how long it will take an express train to
reach the moon if it travelled at the rate of forty miles an
<pb id="washi45" n="45"/>
hour, the pupils figure out how much corn can be raised on
neighbor Smith's patch of land and how much farmer
Jones' pig will bring when slaughtered.</p>
          <p>“The pupils learn neatness and cleanliness by living in a
decent home during their school hours. They carry the
lesson home, and the result is seen in cleaner and better
farmhouses. The model school has become the pattern on
which the farmers and their wives are improving their
homes. . . .”</p>
          <p>Then comes a letter from a poor woman who wants him
in the course of his travels to look up her husband who
abandoned her some years before. For purposes of identification
she says: “This is the hith of him 5-6 light eyes
dark hair unwave shave and a Suprano Voice his age 58
his name Steve. . . .” Even though Mr. Washington 
did not agree to spend his spare time looking for a 
disloyal husband with a soprano voice, he sent the poor
woman a kind reply and suggested some means of tracing
her recreant spouse.</p>
          <p>We come next upon a long letter written to a man who
wishes to quote for publication in a magazine Booker
Washington's opinion on the relation between crime and
education. In the concluding paragraphs of his reply Mr.
Washington says: “In nine cases out of ten the crimes
which serve to unite and give an excuse for mob violence
are committed by men who are without property, without
homes, and without education except what they have
picked up in the city slums, in prisons, or on the chain
gang. The South is spending too much money in giving
<pb id="washi46" n="46"/>
the Negro this kind of education that makes criminals and
not enough on the kind of schools that turn out farmers,
carpenters, and blacksmiths. Other things being equal,
it is true not only in America, in the South, but throughout
the world, that there is the least crime where there is the
most education. This is true of the South and of the
Negro, just the same as it is true of every other race. 
Particularly is it true that the individuals who commit crimes
of violence and crimes that are due to lack of self-control
are individuals who are, for the most part, ignorant. The
decrease in lynching in the Southern States is an index of
the steady growth of the South in wealth, in industry, in
education, and in individual liberty.”</p>
          <p>Then comes a letter to an individual who desires to know
what proportion of the American Negroes can read and
write now, and what proportion could at the time of the
Civil War. The reply again quotes the 1910 census to the
effect that 69.5 per cent. can now read and write as 
compared with only 3 per cent. at the close of the war. The
letter also points out that the rate of illiteracy among
American Negroes is now lower than the rate for all the
peoples of Russia, Portugal, Brazil, and Venezuela, and 
almost as low as that of Spain.</p>
          <p>There follows a sheaf of correspondence in which Mr.
Washington agreed to speak at the unveiling of a tablet in
Auburn, New York, to the memory of “Aunt Harriet”
Tubman Davis, the black woman, squat of stature and
seamed of face, who piloted three or four hundred slaves
from the land of bondage to the land of freedom. While
<pb id="washi47" n="47"/>
there he also agreed to speak at Auburn prison in response to
the special request of some of the prisoners.</p>
          <p>Then we find a courteous but firmly negative reply to a 
long-winded bore who writes a six-page letter urging Mr.
Washington to secure the acceptance by the Negro race of a
flag which he has designed as their racial flag.</p>
          <p>After this follows a group of letters which passed between
him and the late Edgar Gardiner Murphy, author of “The
Present South,” “The Basis of Ascendency,” and other
important books. In one of these letters Mr. Washington
agrees, as requested, to read the proofs of “The Basis of
Ascendency,” and in another he thus characteristically
comments upon Mr. Murphy's fears that a pessimistic book on
the status of the Negro written by a supposed authority (a
colored man) would do wide-reaching harm: “Of course among
a certain element it will have an influence for harm, but human
nature, as I observe it, is so constructed that it does not take
kindly to a description of a failure. It is hard to get up
enthusiasm in connection with a funeral procession. No man, in
my opinion, could write a history of the Southern Confederacy
that would be read generally because it failed. I am not saying,
of course, that the Negro race is a failure. Mr.—— writes largely
from that point of view, hence there is no rallying point for the
general reader.”</p>
          <p>In reply to a Western university professor who had asked
his opinion of amalgamation as a solution of the race problem
he wrote: “I have never looked upon amalgamation as offering
a solution of the so-called race problem, and
<pb id="washi48" n="48"/>
I know very few Negroes who favor it or even think of it,
for that matter. What those whom I have heard discuss
the matter do object to are laws which enable the father to
escape his responsibility, or prevent him from accepting
and exercising it, when he has children by colored women.
I think this answers your question, but since there seems
to be some misunderstanding as to how colored people feel
about this subject, I might say in explanation of what I
have already said: The Negroes in America are, as you
know, a mixed race. If that is an advantage we have it; if
it is a disadvantage, it is still ours, and for the simple reason
that the product of every sort of racial mixture between the
black man and any other race is always a Negro and never
a white man, Indian, or any other sort of man.</p>
          <p>“The Negro in America is defined by the census as a
person who is classed as such in the community in which he
or she resides. In other words, the Negro in this country
is not so much of a particular color or particular racial
stock as one who shares a particular condition. It is the
fact that they all share in this condition which creates a
cause of common sympathy and binds the members of the
race together in spite of all differences.”</p>
          <p>To an embarrassing question put by the society editor
of some paper Mr. Washington replied by merely telling a
funny story the application of which to the impertinent
inquiry was obvious. In another letter he summed up his
opinion of the much-mooted question of the franchise in
these two sentences: “There is no reason why every Negro
who is not fitted to vote should not be disfranchised. At
<pb id="washi49" n="49"/>
the same time, there is no good reason why every white man
who is not fitted to vote should not also be disfranchised.”</p>
          <p>From the foregoing correspondence it will be seen that
one of Booker Washington's many rôles was to act as a
kind of plenipotentiary and interpreter between his people
and the dominant race. For this part he was peculiarly
fitted by his thorough understanding of and sympathy for
each race.</p>
          <p>Theodore Roosevelt, immediately after taking the oath
of office as President of the United States, in Buffalo after
the death of President McKinley, wrote Mr. Washington
the following note:</p>

appointments in the South exactly on the lines of our last
conversation together.</p>

          <pb id="washi50" n="50"/>
          <p>This deferred visit finally took place in 1905, not long
after Colonel Roosevelt's triumphant election to the
Presidency, when he came to Tuskegee accompanied by
his secretary, William Loeb, Jr.; Federal Civil Service
Commissioner, John McThenny; Collector of Revenue
for the Birmingham District, J. O. Thompson; Judge
Thomas G. Jones of Montgomery, and a fellow Rough
Rider by the name of Greeneway.</p>
          <p>In response to the above note Mr. Washington went
to the White House and discussed with the President
“possible future appointments in the South” along the lines
agreed upon between them in a conference which they had
had at a time when it had seemed possible that Mr. Roosevelt 
might be given the Republican Presidential nomination 
of 1900, that is, while Mr. Roosevelt was Governor of
New York and a tentative candidate for the nomination.</p>
          <p>Upon his return to Tuskegee after this talk with President 
Roosevelt, Mr. Washington found that the judgeship 
for the Southern District of Alabama had just 
become vacant through the death of the incumbent, Judge
Bruce. Here was an opportunity for the President to
put into practice in striking fashion the policy they had
discussed—namely, to appoint to Federal posts in the
Southern States the best men available and to reward
and recognize conspicuous merit among Southern 
Democrats and Southern Negroes as well as among Southern
white Republicans. Being unable at the moment to
return to Washington, he sent his secretary, Emmett
J. Scott, with the following letter:</p>

information through my secretary, Mr. Emmett J. Scott, whom
you can trust implicitly.</p>
                  <p>Judge Bruce, the Judge of the Middle District of Alabama,
died yesterday. There is going to be a very hard scramble for
his place. I saw ex-governor T. G. Jones yesterday, as I
promised, and he is willing to accept the judgeship of the
Middle District of Alabama. I am more convinced now than
ever that he is the proper man for the place. He has until
recently been president of the Alabama State Bar Association.
He is a Gold Democrat, and is a clean, pure man in every
respect. He stood up in the Constitutional Convention and
elsewhere for a fair election law, opposed lynching, and he 
has been outspoken for the education of both races. He is 
head and shoulders above any of the other persons who I 
think will apply for the position.</p>

                  <p>MY DEAR MR. WASHINGTON: I called to see the
President this morning. I found him all cordiality and 
<pb id="washi52" n="52"/>
brimming over with good will for you. That pleased me much!
He had received the telegram and had made an appointment 
for me. He read your letter, inquired if I knew the
contents, and then launched into a discussion of it.
Wanted to know if Governor Jones supported Bryan in
either campaign. I told him <hi rend="italics">no</hi>. He wanted to know how
I knew. I told him of the letter wherein he (Governor
Jones) stated to you that he was without political 
ambition because he had opposed Bryan, etc. Well, he said
he wanted to hear from you direct as to whether he had
or not, and asked me to write you to find out. I am now
awaiting that wire so as to call again on him. As soon
as I see him again I will wire you and write you as to what
he says. He is going to appoint Governor Jones. That
was made apparent. While I was waiting to see him
Senator Chandler with the Spanish Claims Commission
called. They saw him first. I heard the talk, however,
which was mostly felicitation. Incidentally, however,
Senator Chandler said that the Commission was afraid
it would lose one of its members because of the vacancy
in Alabama, referring to Hon. W. L. Chambers, who was
present and who is a member of the Commission. The
President laughed heartily. Said the Senator always
sprung recommendations unexpectedly, and so forth and
so forth. He did not inquire as to any of the others—
the applicants—seemed interested only to find out about
Governor Jones. . . . There were many correspondents 
there at the door, but I told them I was passing
through to Buffalo, but had stopped over to invite the
President to include Tuskegee in his itinerary when he
goes South again. . . . Will write again when I see
the President again.</p>

                  <p>MY DEAR MR. WASHINGTON: You have my telegram of to-day. 
I sent it as soon as I had seen the President. I had a
three-hour wait to see him and it was tiresome, but I “camped
with them.” When admitted to the general reception room the
President met me and was cordial and asked me to wait awhile, 
till he could dismiss two delegations, then he invited me
into the office, or cabinet room, and read very carefully the
telegram received from you last night—Friday night. His 
face was a study. He was greatly surprised to learn that the
Governor voted for Bryan, and walked about considerably. At
last he said, “Well, I guess I'll have to appoint him, but I 
am awfully sorry he voted for Bryan.” He then asked me who Dr.
Crum<ref id="ref1" n="1" rend="sc" target="note1" targOrder="U">∗</ref>
<note id="note1" n="1" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref1"><p>∗This refers to a suggestion made by Mr. Washington in his 
telegram recommending the appointment of Dr. W. D. Crum, a 
colored physician, to a South Carolina vacancy, so that the 
President could thereby announce at the same time the 
appointment of a first-grade Southern white Democrat and a
first-class colored man.</p></note>
 is and I told him that he was a clean representative
character, and that he was favorably considered by Harrison
for the Charleston postmastership, etc. He did not know him
and asked me what place was referred to. You had not
discussed it with me, but I told him you most likely referred 
to the place made vacant by the death of Webster. He then
called Mr. Cortelyou, Secretary, into the office and asked him
if he knew Crum. He said he didn't but that he had heard of
<pb id="washi54" n="54"/>
him and always favorably. The President then asked
Cortelyou what place a man named B. was being 
considered for, and he said the place made vacant by 
Webster's death. He then turned to me and said that he
was sorry, that he would certainly have considered the
matter if he had had your word earlier. He asked me
to tell you that if you wish Dr. Crum considered for any
other place that he will be glad to have you communicate
with him. I then asked him what I should tell you in
the Governor Jones' matter, and he said: “Tell Mr.
Washington without using my name that party will
most likely be appointed—in fact I will appoint him—
only don't make it that strong by wire.” So I consider
the matter closed.</p>
                  <p>The colored brethren here are scared. They don't
know what to expect, and the word has passed, they say,
that you are the “Warwick” so far as they are concerned.
I hope to find you well in Chicago.</p>

          <p>This precedent-breaking appointment of a Southern
Democrat by a Republican President, made primarily
on the recommendation of Booker Washington and
Grover Cleveland, was acclaimed with enthusiastic
approval by all Democrats everywhere, and in fact
there was no dissenting voice except from the 
office-holding Southern Republicans who naturally resented
this encroachment upon what they regarded as their
patronage rights. At first appreciation was almost
universal of the efforts of the Negro leader in helping a
Republican President to make this far-reaching change in
<pb id="washi55" n="55"/>
the Federal officeholding traditions of the South. Soon,
however, some Southern newspapers began to question
the wisdom of allowing a Negro to have even an advisory
voice in political matters notwithstanding his advice had
in this instance been so acceptable to the South. This
criticism grew so insistent that Judge Jones found himself in
an uncomfortable position because his appointment had
been made, in large part, on the recommendation of a Negro.
He tried to soften the situation by giving out a statement
to the effect that his endorsement by representative white
men would probably have assured his appointment even
without the assistance of Booker Washington. Later,
however, the Judge expressed to Mr. Scott privately,
after listening with deep interest to the recital of all the
incidents connected with his appointment, his appreciation 
of what Booker Washington had done for him.</p>
          <p>Aside from this appointment, Booker Washington had
a voice in many others, including those of Gen. R. D.
Johnson as Receiver of Public Moneys at Birmingham,
Colonel Thomas R. Roulhac as United States District
Judge, and Judge Osceola Kyle of Alabama as United
States District Attorney in the Panama Canal Zone.
During the administrations of both Presidents Roosevelt
and Taft hardly an office of consequence was conferred
upon a Negro without first consulting Mr. Washington.
He did not strive through his influence with Presidents
Roosevelt and Taft to increase the number of Negro
appointees, but rather to raise the personnel of Negro
officeholders. During the period when his advice was
<pb id="washi56" n="56"/>
most constantly sought at the White House, Charles
W. Anderson was appointed Collector of Internal Revenue
for the Second District of New York City; J. C. Napier
of Nashville, Tenn., became Register of the Treasury;
William H. Lewis of Boston was appointed successively
Assistant United States District Attorney and Assistant
Attorney-General of the United States; Robert H. Terrell
was given a Municipal judgeship of the District of Columbia; 
Whitefield McKinlay was made Collector of the Port
for the Georgetown District, District of Columbia; Dr. W.
D. Crum was appointed Collector of Customs for the Port
of Charleston, S. C.; Ralph W. Tyler, Auditor for the Navy
Department at Washington, D. C.; James A. Cobb, Special
Assistant U. S. Attorney in charge of the enforcement
of the Pure Food Law for the District of Columbia, and
Charles A. Cottrell, Collector of Internal Revenue for
the District of Hawaii at Honolulu. In all these notably
excellent appointments Mr. Washington had a voice.</p>
          <p>In 1903, in commenting on a speech of Mr. Washington's 
in which he had emphasized the importance of
quality rather than quantity in Negro appointments, 
President Roosevelt wrote him as follows:</p>
          <q type="letter" direct="unspecified">

have put epigrammatically just what I am doing—that is,
though I have rather reduced the quantity I have done
my best to raise the quality of the Negro appointments.

          <head>CHAPTER THREE</head>
          <head>WASHINGTON: THE EDUCATOR</head>
          <p>THE Tuskegee Commencement exercises dramatize 
education. They enable plain men and women to visualize 
in the concrete that vague word which means so
little to them in the abstract. More properly they
dramatize the identity between real education and
actual life. On the platform before the audience is a
miniature engine to which steam has been piped, a 
miniature frame house in course of construction, and a piece
of brick wall in process of erection. A young man in jumpers 
comes onto the platform, starts the engine and blows
the whistle, whereupon young men and women come 
hurrying from all directions, and each turns to his or her 
appointed task. A young carpenter completes the little
house, a young mason finishes the laying of the brick wall,
a young farmer leads forth a cow and milks her in full
view of the audience, a sturdy blacksmith shoes a horse,
and after this patient, educative animal has been shod he
is turned over to a representative of the veterinary 
division to have his teeth filed. At the same time on the 
opposite side of the platform one of the girl students is 
having a dress fitted by one of her classmates who is a 
dressmaker. She at length walks proudly from the platform
<pb id="washi58" n="58"/>
in her completed new gown, while the young dressmaker
looks anxiously after her to make sure that it “hangs right
behind.” Other girls are doing washing and ironing with
the drudgery removed in accordance with advanced 
Tuskegee methods. Still others are hard at work on hats,
mats, and dresses, while boys from the tailoring department 
sit crosslegged working on suits and uniforms. In
the background are arranged the finest specimens which
scientific agriculture has produced on the farm and 
mechanical skill has turned out in the shops. The pumpkin,
potatoes, corn, cotton, and other agricultural products
predominate, because agriculture is the chief industry
at Tuskegee just as it is among the Negro people of the
South.</p>
          <p>This form of commencement exercise is one of Booker
Washington's contributions to education which has been
widely copied by schools for whites as well as blacks.
That it appeals to his own people is eloquently attested by
the people themselves who come in ever-greater numbers
as the commencement days recur. At three o'clock in
the morning of this great day vehicles of every description,
each loaded to capacity with men, women, and children,
begin to roll in in an unbroken line which sometimes 
extends along the road for three miles. Some of the teachers
at times objected to turning a large area of the Institute 
grounds into a hitching-post station for the horses
and mules of this great multitude, but to all such objections 
Mr. Washington replied, “This place belongs to the
people and not to us.” Less than a third of these eight
<figure id="ill5" entity="wash58"><p>Showing some of the teams of farmers attending the
Annual Tuskegee Negro Conference</p></figure>
<pb id="washi59" n="59"/>
to nine thousand people are able to crowd into the chapel
to see the actual graduation exercises, but all can see the
graduation procession as it marches through the grounds
to the chapel and all are shown through the shops and over
the farm and through the special agricultural exhibits,
and even through the offices, including that of the 
principal. It is significant of the respect in which the 
people hold the Institute, and in which they held Booker 
Washington, that in all these years there has never been on 
these occasions a single instance of drunkenness or 
disorderly conduct.</p>
          <p>In his annual report to the trustees for 1914 Mr. 
Washington said of these commencement exercises: “One of the
problems that constantly confronts us is that of making
the school of real service to these people on this one day
when they come in such large numbers. For many of
them it is the one day in the year when they go to school,
and we ought to find a way to make the day of additional
value to them. I very much hope that in the near future
we shall find it possible to erect some kind of a large 
pavilion which shall serve the purpose of letting these 
thousands see something of our exercises and be helped by 
them.”</p>
          <p>The philosophy symbolized by such graduation exercises 
as we have described may best be shown by quoting
Mr. Washington's own words in an article entitled, 
“Industrial Education and the Public Schools,” which was
published in the <hi rend="italics">Annals of the American Academy of Political 
and Social Science</hi> for September of the year 1913.
In this article Mr. Washington says: “If I were asked
<pb id="washi60" n="60"/>
what I believe to be the greatest advance which Negro
education has made since emancipation I should say that
it has been in two directions: first, the change which has
taken place among the masses of the Negro people as to
what education really is; and, second, the change that has
taken place among the masses of the white people in the
South toward Negro education itself.</p>
          <p>“I can perhaps make clear what I mean by a little 
explanation: the Negro learned in slavery to work but he
did not learn to respect labor. On the contrary, the Negro
was constantly taught, directly and indirectly during
slavery times, that labor was a curse. It was the curse
of Canaan, he was told, that condemned the black man to
be for all time the slave and servant of the white man.
It was the curse of Canaan that made him for all time
‘a hewer of wood and drawer of water.’ The consequence
of this teaching was that, when emancipation came, the
Negro thought freedom must, in some way, mean freedom
from labor.</p>
          <p>“The Negro had also gained in slavery some general
notions in regard to education. He observed that the
people who had education for the most part belonged to
the aristocracy, to the master class, while the people who
had little or no education were usually of the class known
as ‘poor whites.’ In this way education became associated 
in his mind with leisure, with luxury, and freedom
from the drudgery of work with the hands. . . .</p>
          <p>“In order to make it possible to put Negro education
on a sound and rational basis it has been necessary to
<pb id="washi61" n="61"/>
change the opinion of the masses of the Negro people in
regard to education and labor. It has been necessary to
make them see that education, which did not, directly or
indirectly, connect itself with the practical daily interests
of daily life could hardly be called education. It has been
necessary to make the masses of the Negroes see and
realize the necessity and importance of applying what
they learned in school to the common and ordinary things
of life; to see that education, far from being a means of
escaping labor, is a means of raising up and dignifying
labor and thus indirectly a means of raising up and 
dignifying the common and ordinary man. It has been
necessary to teach the masses of the people that the way
to build up a race is to begin at the bottom and not at the
top, to lift the man furthest down, and thus raise the whole
structure of society above him. On the other hand, it
has been necessary to demonstrate to the white man in 
the South that education does not ‘spoil’ the Negro, 
as it has been so often predicted that it would. It was 
necessary to make him actually see that education makes the 
Negro not an idler or spendthrift, but a more industrious,
thrifty, law-abiding, and useful citizen than he otherwise 
would be.”</p>
          <p>The commencement exercises which we have described
are one of the numerous means evolved by Booker
Washington to guide the masses of his own people, as well as
the Southern whites, to a true conception of the value and
meaning of real education for the Negro.</p>
          <p>The correlation between the work of farm, shop, and
<pb id="washi62" n="62"/>
classroom, first applied by General Armstrong at Hampton, 
was developed on an even larger scale by his one-time
student, Booker Washington. The students at Tuskegee
are divided into two groups: the day students who work
in the classroom half the week and the other half on the
farm and in the shops, and the night students who work
all day on the farm or in the shops and then attend school
at night. The day school students pay a small fee in
cash toward their expenses, while the night school
students not only pay no fee but by good and diligent
work gradually accumulate a credit at the school bank
which, when it becomes sufficiently large, enables them
to become day school students. In fact, the great majority 
of the day students have thus fought their way in
from the night school. But all students of both groups
thus receive in the course of a week a fairly even balance
between theory and practice.</p>
          <p>In a corner of each of the shops, in which are carried
on the forty or more different trades, is a blackboard on
which are worked out the actual problems which arise in
the course of the work. After school hours one always
finds in the shops a certain number of the teachers from
the Academic Department looking up problems for their
classes for the next day. A physics teacher may be found
in the blacksmithing shop digging up problems about the
attractive strength of wires and the expansion and 
contraction of metals under heat and cold. A teacher of 
chemistry may be found in the kitchen of the cooking school
unearthing problems relating to the chemistry of food for
<figure id="ill6" entity="wash62"><p>An academic class. A problem in brick masonry.  Mr. Washington always insisted upon correlation: that is, drawing the problems from the various shops and laboratories</p></figure>
<pb id="washi63" n="63"/>
her class the next day. If, on the other hand, you go into
a classroom you will find the shop is brought into the 
classroom just as the classroom has been brought into the
shop. For instance, in a certain English class the topic
assigned for papers was “a model house” instead of
“bravery” or “the increase of crime in cities,” or “the
landing of the Pilgrims.” The boys of the class had 
prepared papers on the architecture and construction of a
model house, while the girls' papers were devoted to its
interior decoration and furnishing. One of the girls
described a meal for six which she had actually prepared
and the six had actually consumed. The meal cost
seventy-five cents. The discussion and criticism which
followed each paper had all the zest which vitally 
practical and near-at-hand questions always arouse.</p>
          <p>When the Department of Superintendence of the National 
Educational Association met in Atlanta, Ga., in 1904,
many of the delegates, after adjournment, visited the
Tuskegee Institute. Among these delegates was Prof.
Paul Monroe of the Department of History and Principles 
of Education of the Teachers' College of Columbia
University. In recording his impressions of his visit,
Professor Monroe says: “My interest in Tuskegee and a
few similar institutions is founded on the fact that here I
find illustrated the two most marked tendencies which are
being formulated in the most advanced educational
thought, but are being worked out slowly and with great
difficulty. These tendencies are: first, the endeavor to
draw the subject matter of education, or the ‘stuff’ of
<pb id="washi64" n="64"/>
schoolroom work, directly from the life of the pupils; and
second, to relate the outcome of education to life's 
activities, occupations, and duties of the pupil in such a 
way that the connection is made directly and immediately 
between schoolroom work and the other activities of the 
person being educated. This is the ideal at Tuskegee, and, 
to a much greater extent than in any other institution I know
of, the practice; so that the institution is working along
not only the lines of practical endeavor, but of the most
advanced educational thought. To such an extent is this
true that Tuskegee and Hampton are of quite as great 
interest to the student of education on account of the 
illumination they are giving to educational theory as they 
are to those interested practically in the elevation of the 
Negro people and in the solution of a serious social problem.
May I give just one illustration of a concrete nature 
coming under my observation while at the school, that will 
indicate the difference between the work of the school and
that which was typical under old conditions, or is yet
typical where the newer ideas, as so well grasped by Mr.
Washington, are not accepted? In a class in English
composition two boys, among others, had placed their
written work upon the board, one having written upon
‘Honor’ in the most stilted language, with various
historical references which meant nothing to himself or to
his classmates—the whole paragraph evidently being
drawn from some outside source; the other wrote upon
‘My Trade—Blacksmithing’—and told in a simple and
direct way of his day's work, the nature of the general
<pb id="washi65" n="65"/>
course of training, and the use he expected to make of his
training when completed. No better contrast could be
found between the old ideas of formal language work,
dominated by books and cast into forms not understood or
at least not natural to the youth, and the newer ideas of
simplicity, directness, and forcefulness in presenting the
account of one's own experience. Not only was this 
contrast an illustration of the ideal of the entire education
offered at Tuskegee in opposition to that of the old, formal,
‘literary’ education as imposed upon the colored race, but
it gave in a nutshell a concept of the new education. This
one experience drawn from the life of the boy and related
directly to his life's duration and circumstances was 
education in the truest sense; the other was not save as Mr.
Washington made it so in its failure. . . .’</p>
          <p>Among the delegates was also Mr. A. L. Rafter, the
Assistant Superintendent of Schools of Boston, who in
speaking at Tuskegee said: “What Tuskegee is doing for
you we are going to take on home to the North. You are
doing what we are talking about.” In general, these 
foremost educational experts of the dominant race looked to
Booker Washington and Tuskegee for leadership instead of
expecting him or his school to follow them.</p>
          <p>Booker Washington not only practised at Tuskegee this
close relation between school life and real life—and it 
is being continued now that he is gone—but preached it
whenever and wherever opportunity offered. Some years
ago, in addressing himself to those of his own students who
expected to become teachers, he said on this subject among
<pb id="washi66" n="66"/>
other things: “. . . colored parents depend upon
seeing the results of education in ways not true of the white
parent. It is important that the colored teacher on this
account give special attention to bringing school life into
closer touch with real life. Any education is to my mind
‘high’ which enables the individual to do the very best
work for the people by whom he is surrounded. Any 
education is ‘low’ which does not make for character and
effective service.</p>
          <p>“The average teacher in the public schools is very likely
to yield to the temptation of thinking that he is educating
an individual when he is teaching him to reason out 
examples in arithmetic, to prove propositions in geometry,
and to recite pages of history. He conceives this to be the
end of education. Herein is the sad deficiency in many
teachers who are not able to use history, arithmetic, and 
geometry as means to an end. They get the idea that the
student who has mastered a certain number of pages in a
textbook is educated, forgetting that textbooks are at
best but tools, and in many cases ineffective tools, for the
development of man. . . .</p>
          <p>“The average parent cannot appreciate how many 
examples Johnny has worked out that day, how many
questions in history he has answered; but when he says,
‘Mother, I cannot go back to that school until all the 
buttons are sewed on my coat,’ the parent will at once become
conscious of school influence in the home. This will be the
best kind of advertisement. The button propaganda
tends to make the teacher a power in the community. A
<pb id="washi67" n="67"/>
few lessons in applied chemistry will not be amiss. Take
grease spots, for example. The teacher who with tact can
teach his pupils to keep even threadbare clothes neatly
brushed and free from grease spots is extending the school
influence into the home and is adding immeasurably to the
self-respect of the home.”<ref id="ref2" n="2" rend="sc" target="note2" targOrder="U">∗</ref></p>

          </note>
          <p>The idea that education is a matter of personal habits of
cleanliness, industry, integrity, and right conduct while of
course not original with Booker Washington was perhaps
further developed and more effectively emphasized by him
than by any other American education. Just as Matthew
Arnold insisted that religion was a matter of conduct
rather than forms and dogmas so Booker Washington held
that education is a matter of character and not forms. He
concluded one of his Sunday night talks to his students
with these words: “I want every Tuskegee student as he
finds his place in the surging industrial life about him to
give heed to the things which are ‘honest and just and
pure and of good report,’ for these things make for 
character, which is the only thing worth fighting for. . . .”
In another of these talks he said: “A student should not
be satisfied with himself until he has grown to the point
where, when simply sweeping a room, he can go into the
corners and crevices and remove the hidden trash which,
although it should be left, would not be seen. It is not
very hard to find people who will thoroughly clean a room
which is going to be occupied, or wash a dish which is to be
<pb id="washi68" n="68"/>
handled by strangers; but it is hard to find a person who
will do a thing right when the eyes of the world are not
likely to look upon what has been done. The cleaning of
rooms and the washing of dishes have much to do with
forming characters.”<ref id="ref3" n="3" rend="sc" target="note3" targOrder="U">∗</ref></p>

          </note>
          <p>This recalls Booker Washington's own experience when
as a ragged and penniless youth he applied for admission
to Hampton and was given a room to sweep by way of an
entrance examination. Indeed, one of Booker Washington's 
greatest sources of strength as a teacher lay in the
fact that his own life not only illustrated the truth of his
assertions, but illustrated it in a striking and dramatic
manner. His life was, in fact, an epitome of the hardships,
struggles, and triumphs of the successful members of his
race from the days of slavery to the present time. A great
believer in the power of example he lived a life which gave
him that power in its highest degree. Because of his 
inherent modesty and good taste he never referred to 
himself or his achievements as examples to be emulated, and
this merely further enhanced their power.</p>
          <p>In concluding another Sunday night talk he said: “As a
race we are inclined, I fear, to make too much of the day of
judgment. We have the idea that in some far-off period
there is going to be a great and final day of judgment, when
every individual will be called up, and all his bad deeds will
be read out before him and all his good deeds made known.
I believe that every day is a day of judgment, that we reap
<pb id="washi69" n="69"/>
our rewards daily, and that whenever we sin we are 
punished by mental and physical anxiety and by a weakened
character that separates us from God. Every day is, I
take it, a day of judgment, and as we learn God's laws and
grow into His likeness we shall find our reward in this world
in a life of usefulness and honor. To do this is to have
found the kingdom of God, which is the kingdom of 
character and righteousness and peace.”<ref id="ref4" n="4" rend="sc" target="note4" targOrder="U">∗</ref></p>

          </note>
          <p>To quote once more from these Sunday night talks, in
another he said: “There is, then, opportunity for the
colored people to enrich the material life of their adopted
country by doing what their hands find to do, minor duties
though they be, so well that nobody of any race can do
them better. This is the aim that the Tuskegee student
should keep steadily before him. If he remembers that
all service, however lowly, is true service, an important
step will have been taken in the solution of what we term
‘the race problem.’ ”</p>
          <p>As is shown by these quotations Booker Washington
used these Sunday night talks to crystalize, interpret, and
summarize the meaning and significance of the kind of
education which Tuskegee gives. He, the supreme head of
the institution, reserved to himself this supremely 
important task. The heads of the manifold trades are
naturally and properly concerned primarily with turning
raw boys and girls into good workmen and workwomen.
The academic teachers in the school are similarly 
<pb id="washi70" n="70"/>
interested in helping them as students to secure a mastery 
of their several subjects. The military commandants are
concerned with their ability to drill, march, carry 
themselves properly, and take proper care of their persons 
and rooms. The physician is interested in their physical
health and the chaplain in their religious training. 
Important as are all these phases of Tuskegee's training and
closely as he watched each Mr. Washington realized that
they might all be well done and yet Tuskegee fail in its
supreme purpose: namely, the making of manly men and
womanly women out of raw boys and girls. As he said in
one of the passages quoted, “character is the only thing
worth fighting for.” Now, while the forming of character is
the aim, and in some appreciable degree the achievement, of
every worth-while educational institution, it is to a 
peculiar degree the aim and the achievement of Tuskegee. The
ten million Negroes in the United States need trained
leaders of their own race more than they need anything
else. Whatever else they should or should not have these
leaders must have character. Since Tuskegee is the largest 
of the educational institutions for Negroes, with the man 
at its head who was commonly recognized as the leader of 
leaders in his race, naturally the heaviest responsibility 
in the training of these leaders fell, and will continue
to fall, upon Tuskegee. Consequently the task at Tuskegee 
is not so much to educate so many thousands of young
men and women as to train as many leaders for the Negro
people as can possibly be done and done well within a
given space of time. These Tuskegee graduates lead by
<pb id="washi71" n="71"/>
the power of example and not by agitation. One runs a
farm and achieves so much more success than his neighbors, 
through his better methods, that they gradually
adopt these methods and with his help apply them to their
own conditions. Another teaches a country school and
does it so much better than the average country school
teacher that his or her school comes to be regarded as a
model to be emulated by the other schools of the locality.
When a Tuskegee girl marries and settles in a community
she keeps her house so much cleaner and in every way more
attractive than the rank and file of her neighbors that
gradually her house and her methods of housekeeping 
become the standard for the neighborhood. There is, 
however, nothing of the “holier than thou” or the complaisant
about the true Tuskegee graduate and neither is there
anything monopolistic. They have had the idea of service
thoroughly drilled into their consciousness—the idea that
their advantages of education are, as it were, a trust which
they are to administer for the benefit of those who have not
had such advantages.</p>
          <p>Now such leaders as these must not only be provided if
the so-called race problem is to be solved, but they must
be provided speedily. In every community in which the
black people are ignorant and vicious and without trained
leaders among themselves they are likely at any time to
come into conflict with the dominant race, and every such
conflict engenders bitterness on both sides and makes just
so much more difficult the final solution of the race 
problem. This is why Booker Washington labored so 
<pb id="washi72" n="72"/>
incessantly to increase the quantity of Tuskegee's output
as well as to maintain the quality. He brought Tuskegee 
to the point where it reached through all its courses
including its summer courses, short courses, and extension
courses, more than 4,000 people in a single year, not
counting the well-nigh innumerable hosts he counseled
with on his State educational tours. In short, Booker
Washington's task at Tuskegee was not only to turn out
good leaders for his people, but to turn them out wholesale 
and as fast as possible. He was, as it were, running a
race with the powers of ignorance, poverty, and vice. This
in part accounted for the sense of terrific pressure which
one felt at Tuskegee, particularly when he was present and
personally driving forward his great educational machine.
This also may have accounted for the seeming lack
of finesse in small matters which occasionally annoyed
critical visitors who did not understand that the great 
institution was racing under the spur of its indomitable
master, and that just as in any race all but essentials must
be thrown aside.</p>
          <p>Long before the University of Wisconsin had, through its
extension courses, extended its opportunities in greater or
less degree to the citizens of the entire State, Booker 
Washington, through similar means, had extended the 
advantages of Tuskegee throughout Macon County in particular
and the State of Alabama and neighboring States in general.</p>
          <p>The extension work of Tuskegee began in a small way
over twenty years ago. It preceded even the work of the
demonstration agents of the United States Department
<pb id="washi73" n="73"/>
of Agriculture. There was first only one man who in his spare
time went out among the farming people and tried to arouse
enthusiasm for better methods of farming, better schools, and
better homes. He was followed by a committee of three
members of the Tuskegee faculty, which committee still
directs the work. One of the first efforts of this committee
was to get the farmers to adopt deep plowing. There was not
a two-horse plow to be found. There was a strong prejudice
against deep plowing which was thus expressed by a Negro
preacher farmer whom one of the committee tried to 
persuade: “We don't want deep plowing. You're fixin' for us to
have no soil. If we plow deep it will all wash away and in a
year or two we will have to clear new ground.” Not long after
this a member of the committee with a two-horse plow was
practising what he had been preaching when a white planter
who was passing stopped and said: “See here, its none of my
business of course, but you're new here and I don't want to
see you fail. But if you plow your land deep like that 
you'll ruin it sure. I know. I've been here.”</p>
          <p>After a time, however, the committee persuaded a few
colored farmers to try deep plowing on a small scale as an
experiment. One of the first of these was a poor man who had
had the hardest kind of a struggle scraping a scant existence
out of the soil for himself and his large family. He was
desperate and agreed to try the new method. He got results
the first year, moved on to better land and followed
instructions. In a few years he bought 500 acres of land, 
gave each of his four sons 100 acres, and kept 100 acres 
<pb id="washi74" n="74"/>
for himself. Since then father and sons alike have been
prosperous and contented and have added to their holdings.</p>
          <p>In short, these Negro farmers were no more eager to be
reformed and improved in their methods than are any
normal people. There is a shallow popular sentiment that
unless people are eager for enlightenment and gratefully
receive what is offered them they should be left 
unenlightened. Booker Washington never shared this sentiment. 
His agent reported that in response to their appeals
for the raising of a better grade of cattle, hogs, and fowl
the farmers replied that the stock they had was good
enough. One of their favorite comments was, “When you
eat an egg what difference does it make to you whether
that egg was laid by a full-blooded fowl or a mongrel?”
Instead of being discouraged or disgusted by this attitude
on the part of the people he merely regarded it as what
was to be expected and set about devising means to 
overcome it. As always he placed his chief reliance upon the
persuasive eloquence of the concrete. He decided to send
blooded stock and properly raised product's around among
the farmers so that they might compare them with their
inferior stock and products and see the difference with their
own eyes. This plan was later carried out through the
Jesup Wagon contributed by the late Morris K. Jesup of
New York. This wagon was a peripatetic farmers' school.
It took a concentrated essence of Tuskegees' agricultural
department to the farmers who could not or would not
come to Tuskegee.</p>
          <p>The wagon was drawn by a well-bred and well-fed mule. 
<pb id="washi75" n="75"/>
A good breed of cow was tied behind. Several chickens of 
good breeds, well-developed ears of corn, stalks of cotton,
bundles of oats and seeds, and garden products, which
ought at the time to be growing in the locality, together
with a proper plow, for deep plowing, were loaded upon the
wagon. The driver would pull up before a farmhouse,
deliver his message, and point out the strong points of his
wagonload and would finally request a strip of ground for
cultivation. This request granted he would harness the
mule to the plow, break the ground deep, make his rows,
plant his seeds, and move on to the next locality. With a
carefully planned follow-up system he would return to
each such plot for cultivation and harvest, and, most 
important of all, to demonstrate the truths he had sought to
impress upon the people by word of mouth. Where the first
driver sent out was a general farmer, the second would be,
let us say, a dairyman, the third a truck gardener, and
finally a poultry raiser would go; usually a woman, since in
the South women, for the most part, handle this phase of
farming. These agents also distribute pamphlets prepared
by the Agricultural Research Department of Tuskegee on
such subjects as school gardening, twenty-one ways to
cook cowpeas, improvement of rural schools, how to fight
insect pests, cotton growing, etc. The constant emphasis
upon practice by no means entails any neglect of theory.</p>
          <p>Besides this work there is each January for two weeks at
Tuskegee the regular Farmers' Short Course. Many of
the country schools adjourn for this period so that both
teachers and pupils may attend. In this course not only
<pb id="washi76" n="76"/>
teachers and pupils, but fathers and mothers, sons and
daughters sit side by side in the classrooms receiving
instruction in stock raising, canning, poultry raising, and
farming in all its branches. There are special courses for the
women and girls in the care of children and in housekeeping.
The following breezy announcement is taken from the
prospectus of this course for the year 1914:</p>
          <lb/>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">A creation of the farmer, by the farmers and for the
farmer.</hi>”</p>
          <p>“It meets the crying needs of thousands of our boys and
girls, fathers and mothers.</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">It's free to all—no examination nor entrance fee is
required.</hi></p>
          <p>“It started 7 years ago with 11 students; the second year we
had 17, the third year we had 70, the fourth year we had 490,
and last year we had nearly 2,000. It is the only thing of 
its kind for the betterment of the colored farmers. It lasts 
for only 12 days. It comes at a time when you would be 
celebrating Christmas.<ref id="ref5" n="5" rend="sc" target="note5" targOrder="U">∗</ref> 
<note id="note5" n="5" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref5"><p>∗There is a custom among the colored people, inherited from 
the days of slavery, which is fortunately now drying out, 
to celebrate Christmas for a period of a week or ten days 
by stopping work and giving themselves over to a round of 
sprees.</p></note>
In previous years the farmers have 
walked from 3 to 6 miles to attend; many have come on 
horseback, in wagons, and in buggies. You who live so that 
you cannot come in daily can secure board near the school 
for $2.50 per week. We expect 2,000 to 2,500 to enter this 
year.”</p>
          <lb/>
          <p>And then as a further stimulus to attend there comes:</p>
          <lb/>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Prizes will be given as follows:</hi></p>
          <p>“A prize of $5 will be given to the person who makes the
greatest progress on all subjects taught.</p>
          <pb id="washi77" n="77"/>
          <p>“A prize of $2 will be given to the person who is the best
judge of livestock.</p>
          <p>“A prize of $1 will be given to the person who shows the
best knowledge of the use and application of manures and
fertilizers. And so on through a further list of one-dollar 
prizes for all the major activities of the Course.”</p>
          <lb/>
          <p>It will be noted that there is nothing stilted or academic
about this announcement.</p>
          <p>Immediately following this Farmers' Short Course comes
the Annual Farmers' Conference which holds its session in
January of each year. To enforce the lessons in canning, stock
raising, gardening, and all the other branches of farming,
exhibits of the best products in each activity are displayed
before the audience of farmers and their families, who number
in all about 2,000. These exhibits are made and explained by
the farmers themselves. The man, woman, or child who has
produced the exhibit comes to the platform and explains in his
or her own way just how it was done. In these explanations
much human nature is thrown in. An amazingly energetic and
capable woman had explained at one of these gatherings how
she had paid off the mortgage on their farm by the proceeds
from her eggs, her kitchen garden, and her preserving in her
spare moments when she was not helping her husband in the
cotton field, washing and dressing her six children, or 
cooking, mending, washing, and scrubbing for the household.</p>
          <p>In conclusion she said:</p>
          <p>“Now my ole man he's an' old-fashion farmer an' he don'
kere fur dese modern notions, an' so I don't git no
<pb id="washi78" n="78"/>
help from him, an' that makes it hard for me 'cause it
ain't nat'ral for der woman to lead. If I could only git
him to move I'd be happier jest ter foller him.” While
these explanations are going on the farmers in the audience
are naturally saying to themselves over and over again,
“I could do that!” or “Why couldn't I do that?”</p>
          <p>One of Mr. Washington's chief aims was to increase the
wants of his people and at the same time increase their
ability to satisfy them. In other words, he believed in
fermenting in their minds what might be termed an 
effective discontent with their circumstances. With this 
purpose in view he addressed to them at these conferences 
such questions as the following:</p>
          <p>“What kind of house do you live in?”</p>
          <p>“Do you own that house?”</p>
          <p>“What kind of schoolhouse have you?”</p>
          <p>“Do you send your children to school regularly?”</p>
          <p>“How many months does your school run?”</p>
          <p>“Do you keep your teacher in the community?”</p>
          <p>“What kind of church have you?”</p>
          <p>“Where does your pastor live?”</p>
          <p>“Are your church, school, and home fences whitewashed?</p>
          <p>The farmers who were asked these questions would
make an inward resolve that they would do what they
could to put themselves in a position to answer the same
questions more satisfactorily another year.</p>
          <p>Another feature of the work of Tuskegee beyond its own
borders is that of the Rural School Extension Department.
<pb id="washi79" n="79"/>
Mr. Julius Rosenwald of Chicago, one of the trustees of
Tuskegee, has offered, through this department, during a
stated period of time, to add $300 to every $300 the 
Negroes in rural communities of the South raise for the
building of a new and modern schoolhouse. Under this
plan ninety-two modern rural school buildings have 
already been constructed. At the close of the time set Mr.
Rosenwald will probably renew his offer for a further
period. The social by-products of this campaign, in
teaching the Negroes of these communities how to 
disregard their denominational and other feuds in working
together for a high civic purpose of common advantage to
all, and the friendly interest in Negro education awakened
among their white neighbors, have been almost if not quite
as important as the new schools themselves.</p>
          <p>There is also at Tuskegee a summer school for teachers
in which last year were registered 437 teachers from fifteen
Southern and several other States. Most of these teachers
elect such practical subjects as canning, basket-making,
broom-making, shuck and pine needlework or some form
of manual training, as well as the teacher-training courses.
One of these students, who was the supervisor of the
Negro schools of an entire county, when she returned from
her summer school work proceeded to vivify her dead
schools by introducing the making of wash-boards, trash
baskets, baskets made of weeping-willow, and pine needle
work in its various forms. The registration soared at
once, the indifferent Negro parents became interested,
and before long the parents of white children complained
<pb id="washi80" n="80"/>
to the county superintendent that the colored children
were being taught more than their children.</p>
          <p>There is at the present time being developed at Tuskegee
a unique experiment in the nature of what might be called
a post-graduate school in real life for the graduates of
the agricultural department. This consists in providing
such graduates, who have no property of their own, with
a forty-acre farm, on an 1,800-acre tract about nine miles
from Tuskegee, known as Baldwin Farms, after the late
Wm. H. Baldwin, Jr., who was one of the ablest and most
devoted supporters and advisers of Booker Washington
and Tuskegee. The land is held by the Tuskegee Farm
and Improvement Company which is conducted on a
business and not a charitable basis. The company sells
the farms at an average price of $15 an acre, and purchasers
who move directly on to the land are given ten years in
which to pay for it, with the first payment at the end of
the first year. If there is no house on the land the 
company will put up a $300 house so planned as to permit
the addition of rooms and improvements as rapidly as the
purchaser is able to pay for them; the cost to be added
to the initial cost of the land. When the graduate lacks
the money and equipment necessary to plant, raise, and
harvest crops, for this, too, the company will advance a
reasonable sum, taking as security a mortgage on crops
and equipment until the loan has been paid off. This
mortgage bears interest at 8 per cent. while the interest
on the mortgage on the land is not more than 6 per cent.
Through coöperative effort within this colony it is 
<pb id="washi81" n="81"/>
proposed to develop such organizations as coöperative dairy,
fruit growing, poultry, and live-stock associations and
thus make it possible for the members of the colony to
make not only a comfortable living but to lay by something. 
They will, of course, have also the great advantage 
of the advice and guidance of the experts of the
Institute. Formerly the penniless Negro youth, who
graduated even most creditably from the agricultural
department of Tuskegee, had before him nothing better
than a greater or less number of years of monotonous
drudgery as a mere farm or plantation laborer. Now, he
may at once take up his own farm at Baldwin and begin
immediately to apply all he has learned in carving out
his own fortune and future. Thus did Booker Washington
plan to carry the benefits of classroom instruction directly
into the actual life problems of these graduates as well as
bringing the problems of actual life into the classroom.</p>
          <p>However much Mr. Washington may have seemed
to eliminate non-essentials in the pressure and haste of
his wholesale educational task he never neglected 
essentials, but among essentials he included matters which
might on the surface appear to be small and trifling.
For instance, he insisted upon good table manners, and
no boy or girl could spend any considerable time at
Tuskegee without acquiring such manners. Instead of
a trivial detail he regarded good table manners as an
essential to self-respect and hence to the development of
character. In short, he was engaged not so much in
conducting a school as educating a race.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER FOUR</head>
          <head>THE RIGHTS OF THE NEGRO</head>
          <p>BOOKER WASHINGTON was occasionally accused
both by agitators in his own race and by a certain
type of Northern white men who pose as the special
champions of the “downtrodden” black man as 
encouraging a policy of submission to injustice on the
part of his people. He was, for example, charged with
tame acquiescence in the practical disfranchisement of
the Negro in a number of the Southern States. As a
matter of fact, when these disfranchising measures were
under consideration and before they were enacted, he
in each case earnestly pleaded with the legislators that
whatever restrictions in the use of the ballot they put
upon the statute books should be applied with absolute
impartiality to both races. This he urged in fairness to
the white man as well as the black man.</p>
          <p>In an article entitled, “Is the Negro Having a Fair
Chance?” published in the <hi rend="italics">Century Magazine</hi> five years
ago, Booker Washington said in illustrating the evil
consequences of discrimination in the application of ballot
regulations: “In a certain county of Virginia, where
the county board had charge of registering those who
were to be voters, a colored man, a graduate of Harvard
<pb id="washi83" n="83"/>
University, who had long been a resident of the county, a 
quiet, unassuming man, went before the board to register. 
He was refused on the ground that he was not intelligent 
enough to vote. Before this colored man left the room a 
white man came in who was so intoxicated that he could 
scarcely tell where he lived. This white man was registered, 
and by a board of intelligent white men who had taken an 
oath to deal justly in administering the law.</p>
          <p>“Will any one say that there is wisdom or statesmanship in
such a policy as that? In my opinion it is a fatal mistake 
to teach the young black man and the young white man that the
dominance of the white race in the South rests upon any other
basis than absolute justice to the weaker man. It is a 
mistake to cultivate in the mind of any individual or group 
of individuals the feeling and belief that their happiness 
rests upon the misery of some one else, or that their 
intelligence is measured by the ignorance of some one else; 
or their wealth by the poverty of some one else. I do not 
advocate that the Negro make politics or the holding of 
office an important thing in his life. I do urge, in
the interest of fair play for everybody, that a Negro who
prepares himself in property, in intelligence, and in 
character to cast a ballot, and desires to do so, should 
have the opportunity.”</p>
          <p>While Booker Washington did not believe that political
activities should play an important part among the Negroes 
as a whole he did believe that the exceptional Negro who was
particularly qualified for holding public 
<pb id="washi84" n="84"/>
office should be given the opportunity just as he believed
in the higher academic education for the relatively
small minority capable of profiting by such an 
education.</p>
          <p>In concluding a letter in which he asks Booker 
Washington to recommend a member of his race for a Federal
office in Vicksburg, Miss., President Roosevelt said:
“The question of the political importance of the colored
man is really of no consequence. I do not care to 
consider it, and you must not consider it. Give me the very
best colored man that you know of for the place, upon
whose integrity and capacity we can surely rely.”</p>
          <p>The man, T. V. McAlister, whom Mr. Washington
“gave” the President for this office was of such character
and reputation that the white citizens of Vicksburg 
actually welcomed his appointment. Certainly neither 
Vicksburg nor any other portion of Mississippi can be accused
of over-enthusiasm for conferring civil and political 
privileges upon Negroes.</p>
          <p>Booker Washington's habit of never losing an opportunity 
to advance constructively the interests of his
people is well illustrated by the following letter to 
President Roosevelt:</p>

                  <p>MY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: It has occurred to me that
there are a number of ways in which the colored people
of the United States could be of service in digging the
<pb id="washi85" n="85"/>
Panama Canal, and personally I should be glad to do
anything in my power in getting them interested if deemed
practicable.</p>
                  <p>First: I think they can stand the climate better or as
well as any other people from the United States.</p>
                  <p>Second: I have thought that a reasonably satisfactory
number of them might be useful as common, or skilled,
laborers.</p>
                  <p>Third: That in the Health Department our 
well-trained nurses and physicians might be found 
helpful.</p>
                  <p>Fourth: If the United States should assume any 
responsibility as to education, that many efficient colored
teachers from our industrial schools, and colleges, might
prove of great benefit. And, then, besides the presence
of these educated persons would, in my opinion, both by
character and example, aid in influencing the morality
of the darker-skinned people to be employed at the 
Isthmus. I believe that these educated colored people could
get closer to the masses than white men.</p>

          <p>Nothing came of this suggestion except an acknowledgment 
and an assurance that the matter would be 
considered. About two years ago, however, when Doctor
Washington and Surgeon-General Gorgas met on a train
the Surgeon-General said to Mr. Washington: “The
<pb id="washi86" n="86"/>
biggest man at the canal was the Negro,” and he added that
when they came to the dedication of the canal at its formal
opening some Negro should have a place on the program.</p>
          <p>In recent years a certain section of the Republicans in the
far Southern States have tried to free themselves of the
reputation of being “nigger lovers” by vying with their
Democratic rivals in seeking to deprive Negroes of civic and
political rights. Republicans of this particular stripe are 
known colloquially as the “Lily Whites.” In this connection the following correspondence is of interest.</p>

                  <p>MY DEAR MR.——: I take it for granted that there is
no intention of making the Louisiana delegation all white.
I think it would be a mistake for my friends to take any
such attitude in any state where there is a considerable
Negro population. I think it is a great mistake from the
standpoint of the whites; and in an organization composed
of men whom I have especially favored it would put me
in a false light. As you know, I feel as strongly as any
one can that there must be nothing like “Negro 
domination.” On the other hand, I feel equally strongly that
the Republicans must consistently favor those 
comparatively few colored people who by character and 
intelligence show themselves entitled to such favor. To put a
premium upon the possession of such qualities among the
blacks is not only to benefit them, but to benefit the
whites among whom they live. I very earnestly hope that
the Louisiana Republicans whom I have so consistently
favored will not by any action of theirs tend to put me in
a false position in such a matter as this. With your entire
approval, I have appointed one or two colored men entitled
by character and standing to go to the National 
Convention.</p>
                  <closer><salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
<signed>THEODORE ROOSEVELT.</signed></closer>

          <p>In the year 1898 the success of the suffrage amendments
in South Carolina and Mississippi in excluding from the
<pb id="washi88" n="88"/>
franchise more than nine-tenths of their Negro inhabitants
inspired an agitation in Louisiana to cut off the Negro
vote by similar means, and this agitation came to a head
in the Constitutional Convention of that year. Mr.
Washington, assisted by T. Thomas Fortune, the 
well-known Negro editor, and Mr. Scott, his secretary, 
prepared an open letter addressed to this convention which
was taken to the convention by Mr. Scott and placed in
the hands of the suffrage committee as well as the editors
of the New Orleans <hi rend="italics">Times-Democrat</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">Picayune</hi>, the
leading daily papers of the State. Extracts from the letter
were sent out by the local representative of the Associated
Press and widely published throughout the country.
These New Orleans editors expressed to Mr. Scott their
approval of the letter and their substantial agreement with
its main features, and promised to publish it in full, which
they not only did, but accompanied it by editorial 
reviews. This letter stated in part:</p>
          <p>“The Negro agrees with you that it is necessary to the
salvation of the South that restriction be put upon the
ballot. . . . With the sincerest sympathy with you
in your efforts to find a way out of the difficulty, I want
to suggest that no State in the South can make a law that
will provide an opportunity or temptation for an ignorant
white man to vote and withhold the same opportunity from
an ignorant colored man, without injuring both men.
. . . Any law controlling the ballot, that is not 
absolutely just and fair to both races, will work more 
permanent injury to the whites than to the blacks.
<pb id="washi89" n="89"/>
“The Negro does not object to an educational or property 
test, but let the law be so clear that no one clothed
with state authority will be tempted to perjure and 
degrade himself by putting one interpretation upon it for 
the white man and another for the black man. Study the
history of the South, and you will find that where there
has been the most dishonesty in the matter of voting, there
you will find to-day the lowest moral condition of both
races. First, there was the temptation to act wrongly
with the Negro's ballot. From this it was an easy step
to dishonesty with the white man's ballot, to the carrying
of concealed weapons, to the murder of a Negro, and then
to the murder of a white man and then to lynching. I
entreat you not to pass such a law as will prove an eternal
millstone about the neck of your children.”</p>
          <p>Later in the same appeal he said: “I beg of you, further,
that in the degree that you close the ballot-box against the
ignorant, that you open the schoolhouse. . . . Let
the very best educational opportunities be provided for
both races: and add to this the enactment of an election
law that shall be incapable of unjust discrimination, at the
same time providing that in proportion as the ignorant
secure education, property, and character, they will be
given the right of citizenship. Any other course will take
from one half your citizens interest in the State, and hope
and ambition to become intelligent producers and 
tax-payers—to become useful and virtuous citizens. Any
other course will tie the white citizens of Louisiana to a
body of death.”</p>
          <pb id="washi90" n="90"/>
          <p>The New Orleans <hi rend="italics">Times-Democrat</hi>, in its editorial 
accompanying the publication of this letter, said: “We have
seen the corrupting influence in our politics and our 
elections of making fraud an element of our suffrage system.
We are certainly not going to get away from fraud by
encouraging it, or making it a part of the suffrage system
we place in our new constitution.” The same editorial
further states that impartiality in the use of the ballot
can be given Negro and white man not only “with the
utmost safety,” but “it would have a beneficial effect
upon the politics of the State.” In fact, the press of both
North and South, both of the whites and the blacks, 
published this letter with practically unanimous editorial
endorsement, but in spite of all this the leaders of the 
convention remained obdurate, the immediate object was
lost, and Louisiana followed the example of Mississippi
and South Carolina. No one realized, however, better
than Booker Washington that the effort was by no means
in vain. Owing to the general awakening of intelligent
public opinion the convention leaders were forced into
the position of driving through the discriminatory amendment 
not only in the face of the condemnation of the better
element throughout the country but even with the 
disapproval of the better and leading citizens of their own
State.</p>
          <p>Shortly afterward members of the Georgia Legislature,
seeking political preferment for themselves through the
familiar means of anti-Negro agitation, introduced a bill
which aimed to discriminate against the Negroes of
<pb id="washi91" n="91"/>
Georgia by legislative enactment just as the Negroes of
Louisiana had been discriminated against by a 
constitutional amendment. This time Mr. Washington went
personally to Atlanta and appealed directly to a number
of the members of the Legislature and to the editors of
the leading papers in opposition to this bill. In an 
interview published in the Atlanta <hi rend="italics">Constitution</hi> at the time 
he said:</p>
          <p>“I cannot think that there is any large number of white
people in the South who are so ignorant or so poor that
they cannot get education and property enough to enable
them to stand the test by the side of the Negro in these
respects. I do not believe that these white people want
it continually advertised to the world that some special
law must be passed by which they will seem to be given
an unfair advantage over the Negro by reason of their
ignorance or their poverty. It is unfair to blame the
Negro for not preparing himself for citizenship by acquiring
intelligence, and then when he does get education and
property, to pass a law that can be so operated as to 
prevent him from being a citizen, even though he may be a
large taxpayer. The Southern white people have reached
the point where they can afford to be just and generous;
where there will be nothing to hide and nothing to explain.
It is an easy matter, requiring little thought, generosity or
statesmanship to push a weak man down when he is
struggling to get up. Any one can do that. Greatness,
generosity, statesmanship are shown in stimulating, 
encouraging every individual in the body politic to make of
<pb id="washi92" n="92"/>
himself the most useful, intelligent, and patriotic citizen
possible. Take from the Negro all incentive to make 
himself and his children useful property-holding citizens, 
and can any one blame him for becoming a beast capable of
committing any crime?”</p>
          <p>This time the immediate object was attained. The
Atlanta <hi rend="italics">Constitution</hi> and other leading Georgia papers
indorsed Booker Washington's appeal and the Legislature
voted down its anti-Negro members. Be it said to the
credit of the Georgia Legislature that it has resisted 
several similar attempts to discriminate against the Negro 
citizens of the State, and it was not till 1908, ten years 
after the Louisiana law was passed, that Georgia finally 
passed a law disfranchising Negro voters.</p>
          <p>Booker Washington has been accused of not protesting
against the lynching of Negroes. In the article published
in the <hi rend="italics">Century Magazine</hi> in 1912, from which we have
previously quoted, he said on this subject: “When he was
Governor of Alabama, I heard Governor Jelks say in a
public speech that he knew of five cases during his 
administration of innocent colored people having been lynched.
If that many innocent people were known to the governor
to have been lynched, it is safe to say that there were
other innocent persons lynched whom the governor did
not know about. What is true of Alabama in this respect
is true of other states. In short, it is safe to say that a
large proportion of the colored persons lynched are 
innocent. . . . Not a few cases have occurred where
white people have blackened their faces and committed
<pb id="washi93" n="93"/>
a crime, knowing that some Negro would be suspected
and mobbed for it. In other cases it is known that where
Negroes have committed crimes, innocent men have been
lynched and the guilty ones have escaped and gone on
committing more crimes.</p>
          <p>“Within the last twelve months there have been seventy-one 
cases of lynching, nearly all of colored people. Only
seventeen were charged with the crime of rape. Perhaps
they are wrong to do so, but colored people do not feel
that innocence offers them security against lynching.
They do feel, however, that the lynching habit tends to
give greater security to the criminal, white or black.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Washington often pointed out how the lynching
of blacks leads inevitably to the lynching of whites and
how the lynching of guilty persons of either race inevitably
leads to the lynching of innocent persons of both races.</p>
          <p>Let it not be supposed that Booker Washington 
confined his condemnation of lynching to the comparatively
safe cover of the pages of an eminently respectable 
Northern magazine. Some years ago when he was on a speaking
trip in the State of Florida two depraved Negroes in 
Jacksonville committed an atrocious murder. The crime
aroused such intense race feeling that Mr. Washington's
friends foresaw the likelihood of a lynching and, fearing
for his safety, urged him to cancel his engagements in
Jacksonville, where he was due to speak before white as
well as black audiences within a few days. This he 
refused to do and insisted that because there was special
racial friction it was especially necessary that he should
<pb id="washi94" n="94"/>
keep his engagements in the city. While he was driving
to the hall where he was to address a white audience the
automobile of one of his Negro escorts was stopped by a
crowd of excited white men who angrily demanded that
Booker Washington be handed over to them. When
they found he was not in the car they allowed it to pass
on without molesting the Negro occupant, who enjoyed
to an unusual degree the confidence and respect of both
races in the city. What they would have done had they
found Booker Washington one may only conjecture. At
about the same time the Negro murderers were captured.
The howls of the infuriated mob on its way to the jail to
lynch the accused murderers could be heard in the distance
from the hall where Mr. Washington spoke. Without
referring in any way to the event which was taking place
at the time Mr. Washington, to the alarm of his friends,
launched into a fervid denunciation of lynching and ended
with an earnest and eloquent appeal for better feeling
between the races. Instead of his words breaking up the
meeting in a storm of anger and rioting, this audience
composed of Southern whites and colored people vigorously 
applauded his sentiments. Undoubtedly they were
applauding not so much the views expressed as the courage 
shown in expressing them at that place and under
those circumstances.</p>
          <p>A somewhat similar experience occurred on a recent
speaking tour which he and a party were making through
the State of Louisiana. He was accompanied by a 
company of Negro leaders, including Major Moton of Hampton,
<pb id="washi95" n="95"/>
who has since become his successor as Principal of
Tuskegee Institute. They were in a portion of the State
notorious for its lynchings of Negroes. No one who has
ever seen Major Moton, or knows anything about him,
would think of accusing him of timidity or cowardice.
But when they went before a white audience in this 
particular district he urged Mr. Washington as a matter of
common prudence to “soft pedal” what he had to say
about lynching. Just as in Jacksonville Mr. Washington did 
just the opposite, and made his denunciation particularly 
emphatic, and just as in Jacksonville there was the
same applause and apparent approval of his views.</p>
          <p>Booker Washington also protested that in the matter of
public education his people are not given a square deal in
parts of the South, particularly in the country districts.
He continually emphasized the relation between education
and crime. Other things being equal the more and the
better the education provided the less the number and
seriousness of the crimes committed. Also he pointed out
that the neglect of Negro school facilities injures the white
citizens almost if not quite as much as the Negroes 
themselves. And conversely that good school facilities for the
colored children benefit the whites almost as much as the
Negroes. He also insisted that quite aside from all moral
and ethical considerations Negro education pays in dollars
and cents. As illustrating the relation between Negro
education and crime or rather lack of Negro education and
crime he related this incident in an article entitled, “Black
and White in the South” published in the <hi rend="italics">Outlook</hi> of March
<pb id="washi96" n="96"/>
14, 1914: “A few weeks ago three of the most prominent
white men in Mississippi were shot and killed by two
colored boys. Investigation brought to light that the two
boys were rough and crude, that they had never been to
school, hence that they were densely ignorant. While no
one had taught these boys the use of books, some one had
taught them, as mere children, the use of cocaine and
whiskey. In a mad fit, when their minds and bodies were
filled with cheap whiskey and cocaine, these two ignorant
boys created a ‘reign of murder,’ in the course of which
three white men, four colored men, and one colored woman
met death. As soon as the shooting was over a crazed
mob shot the two boys full of bullet-holes and then burned
their bodies in the public streets.</p>
          <p>“Now this is the kind of thing, more or less varied in
form, that takes place too often in our country. Why?
The answer is simple: it is dense ignorance on the part of
the Negro and indifference arising out of a lack of 
knowledge of conditions on the part of the white people.”</p>
          <p>He then pointed out that the last enumeration in
Mississippi, where this crime was committed, indicated
that 64 per cent. of the colored children had had no 
schooling during the past year. That in Charleston County,
South Carolina, another backward State in Negro education, 
there was expended on the public education of each
white child $20.2; for the colored child $3.12; in Abbeville
County $11.17 for the white, 69 cents for the colored
child. This 69 cents per capita expense was incurred by
maintaining a one-room school for two and one-half
<pb id="washi97" n="97"/>
months, with a teacher paid at the rate of $15 a month.
In another county the Negro school was in session but one
month out of the twelve. Throughout the State, outside
the cities and large towns, the school term for the colored
children is from two to four months. Thus 200,000
colored children in South Carolina are given only three or
four months of schooling a year. “Under these conditions
it would require twenty-eight years for a child to complete
the eight grades of the public school. . . . But South
Carolina is by no means the only State that has these
breeding spots for ignorance, crime, and filth which the
nation will sooner or later have to reckon with.”</p>
          <p>In the article in the <hi rend="italics">Century Magazine</hi> from which
quotations have already been made Mr. Washington
cites this statement made by W. N. Sheats, former
Superintendent of Education for the State of Florida, in
explanation of an analysis of the sources of the school fund
of the State: “A glance at the foregoing statistics 
indicates that the section of the State designated as ‘Middle
Florida’ is considerably behind all the rest in all stages of
educational progress. The usual plea is that this is due
to the intolerable burden of Negro education, and a 
general discouragement and inactivity is ascribed to this
cause. The following figures are given to show that the
education of the Negroes of Middle Florida does not cost
the white people of that section one cent. Without 
discussing the American principle that it is the duty of all
property to educate every citizen as a means of protection
to the State, and with no reference to what taxes that
<pb id="washi98" n="98"/>
citizen may pay, it is the purpose of this paragraph to show
that the backwardness of education of the white people is
in no degree due to the presence of the Negro, but that the
presence of the Negro has been actually contributing to the
sustenance of the white schools.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Sheats then shows that the cost of the Negro schools
was $19,467, while the Negroes contributed to the school
fund in direct taxes, together with their proper proportion
of the indirect taxes, $23,984. He concludes: “If this is a
fair calculation the schools for the Negroes are not only no
burden on the white citizens, but $4,525 for Negro schools
contributed from other sources was in some way diverted
to the white schools.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Charles L. Coon, Superintendent of Schools at Wilson, 
N. C., is quoted as demonstrating that had there been
expended upon the Negro schools the Negro's proportionate 
share of the receipts from indirect taxes, as well as the
direct taxes paid by them, $18,077 more in a given year
would have been expended on colored schools in Virginia,
$26,539 more in North Carolina, and $141,682 more in
Georgia. These figures would seem to show that in these
States at least the Negro schools are not only no burden
upon the white taxpayers but that the colored people do
not get back in school facilities the equivalent of all they
themselves contribute in taxes.</p>
          <p>In the matter of passenger transportation facilities
Booker Washington protested that injustice is done his
people by most of the railroads of the South, not in 
providing separate accommodations for blacks and whites, 
but in
<pb id="washi99" n="99"/>
furnishing the Negroes with inferior accommodations while
charging them the same rates. This injustice causes,
he believes, more resentment and bitterness among his
people than all the other injustices to which they are 
subjected combined. The Negro or “Jim Crow” compartment 
is usually half of the baggage car which is usually
inadequate for the traffic, badly lighted, badly ventilated,
and dirty. The newsdealer of the train uses this coach and
increases the congestion by spreading his wares over 
several seats. White men frequently enter this compartment
to buy papers and almost always smoke in it, thus requiring
the colored women to ride in what is virtually a smoker.
Aside from these matters the Negroes rarely have through
cars and no sleeping, parlor, or buffet cars, and frequently
no means of securing food on long journeys since many if
not most of the station restaurants refuse to serve them.</p>
          <p>In the <hi rend="italics">Century</hi> article Mr. Washington thus quoted the
experience of a sensible and conservative Negro friend of
his from Austin, Texas—a man of education and good
reputation among both races in his native city: “At one
time,” he said, in describing some of his travelling 
experiences, “I got off at a station almost starved. I begged
the keeper of the restaurant to sell me a lunch in a paper 
and hand it out of the window. He refused, and I had to
travel a hundred miles farther before I could get a 
sandwich. At another time I went to a station to purchase my
ticket. I was there thirty minutes before the ticket office
was opened. When it did finally open I at once appeared
at the window. While the ticket agent served the white
<pb id="washi100" n="100"/>
people at one window, I remained waiting at the other 
until the train pulled out. I was compelled to jump 
aboard the train without my ticket and wire back to get 
my trunk expressed. Considering the temper of the 
people, the separate coach law may be the wisest plan for 
the South, but the statement that the two races have equal 
accommodations is all bosh. I pay the same money, but I 
cannot have a chair or a lavatory, and rarely a through 
car. I must crawl out at all times of night, and in all
kinds of weather, in order to catch another dirty ‘Jim Crow’
coach to make my connections. I do not ask to ride with 
white people. I do ask for equal accommodations for the 
same money.”</p>
          <p>Booker Washington was of course obliged to travel in the
South almost constantly and to a great extent at night. He
nearly always travelled on a Pullman car, and so when not an
interstate passenger usually “violated” the law of whatever
State he happened to be passing through. The conductors,
brakemen, and other trainmen, as a rule, treated him with 
great respect and consideration and oftentimes offered him a
compartment in place of the berth which he had purchased.</p>
          <p>Pullman cars in the South are not as a rule open to members
of the Negro race. It is only under more or less unusual
conditions that a black man is able to secure Pullman
accommodations. Dr. Washington, however, was generally
treated with marked consideration whenever he applied for
Pullman car reservations. He was sometimes criticised, not
only by members of his own race, but by the
<pb id="washi101" n="101"/>
unthinking of the white race who accused him of thus seeking
“social equality” with the white passengers.</p>
          <p>The work he was compelled to do, however, in constantly
travelling from place to place, and dictating letters while
travelling, made it necessary that he conserve his strength 
as much as possible. He never believed that he was defying
Southern traditions in seeking the comfort essential to his
work.</p>
          <p>Upon one occasion Dr. Washington went to Houston,
Texas, and was invited by the Secretary of the Cotton
Exchange, in the name of the Exchange, to speak to the
members of the leading business organizations of Houston,
upon the floor of the Cotton Exchange Bank. He was
introduced by the secretary, who desired to give Dr.
Washington the opportunity to put before representative
Southern white men the thoughts and ideas of a representative
colored man as to how the two races might live together in 
the South on terms of mutual helpfulness. Such was the
impression he made upon the whites that when Dr.
Washington's secretary applied for Pullman accommodations
for him, returning East, they were not only ungrudgingly but
even eagerly granted. In those days it was unheard of for a
colored man to travel as a passenger in a Pullman car in
Texas.</p>
          <p>The injustices mentioned and all others connected with
railway passenger service for Negroes Booker Washington
sought in characteristic fashion to mitigate by instituting,
through the agency of the National Negro Business League,
what are known as Railroad Days. On these days each
<pb id="washi102" n="102"/>
year colored patrons of railroads lay before the responsible
officials the respects in which they believe they are 
unfairly treated and request certain definite changes. 
Although started only a few years ago these Railroad Days 
have already accomplished a number of the improvements 
desired in various localities.</p>
          <p>As an aid to the committees appointed in the various
communities Mr. Washington sent out a letter addressed to
these committees which was published in the Negro papers.
This letter advised that all protests on Railroad Days give: 
first, “a statement of present conditions,” second, “a 
statement of conditions desired.” There followed a sample 
detailed statement of the present conditions about which 
there is usually cause for complaint accompanied by a 
similar statement of the conditions desired.</p>
          <p>It was then suggested that these specific recommendations
be followed by these general requests:</p>
          <p>“1. The same class and quality of accommodations for
colored passengers as are provided for the most favored class
of travellers.</p>
          <p>“2. Such regulations as will protect colored passengers from
the rudeness and insults of employees of the railroad.</p>
          <p>“3. Some definite authority to whom these matters may be
referred, where friction arises, and who will, in good faith,
investigate and adjust them.”</p>
          <p>The letter concluded with this advice:</p>
          <p>“All those who are going to act on the suggestions to make a
united effort to bring about better railroad and other 
travelling facilities should not omit to remind our
<pb id="washi103" n="103"/>
people that they have a duty to perform as well as the
railroads.</p>
          <p>“First, our people should try to keep themselves clean
and presentable when travelling, and they should do their
duty in trying to keep waiting-rooms and railroad coaches
clean.</p>
          <p>“Second, it should be borne in mind that little or nothing 
will be accomplished by merely talking about white
people who are in charge of railroads, etc. The only way
to get any results is to go to the people and talk to them
and not about them.”</p>
          <p>Compare this definite, reasonable, and effective form of
protest with the bitter, vague, and futile outcry against
the “Jim Crow” car which is frequently heard.</p>
          <p>Booker Washington sent a marked copy of the <hi rend="italics">Century
Magazine</hi> containing the article, “Is the Negro Having a
Fair Chance?” to the head of every railroad in the South
calling attention to the portion relating to unfair 
treatment in passenger service for his people. In response he
received letters which in almost every case were friendly
and in many cases showed an active desire to coöperate
in the improvement of the conditions complained of.
Mr. Washington published extracts from these letters in
the Negro press prior to his Railroad Day proposal in order
to show that the railroad officials were for the most part
at least willing to give a respectful hearing to the 
complaints of their Negro patrons if properly approached.
President Stevens of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway
Company wrote that he had had one hundred copies of the
<pb id="washi104" n="104"/>
article distributed among the officials and employees of
his road. Mr. J. M. Parker, Receiver and General Manager 
of the Arkansas, Louisiana &amp; Gulf Railway Company,
wrote: “I have your favor with enclosure. . . I shall 
take pleasure in reading this article, and from glancing 
through it I am inclined to think that the statement
that the Negro is not getting a square deal in the way of
transportation facilities is well founded.” Mr. William
J. Black, Passenger of the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Sante Fé
Railway System, wrote in part: “You will, no doubt, be
pleased to learn that the Santa Fé has already provided
equipment for colored travel in conformity with the plan
outlined in your article.” From all or most of the Southern 
railways came letters of the general tenor of those
quoted, and thus was the way prepared for the successful
inauguration of the Railroad Days.</p>
          <p>Constantly as he labored for the rights of his people he
never sought to obtain for them any special privileges.
Unlike most leaders of groups, classes, or races of people
he never sought any exclusive or special advantages for his
followers. He did not want the Negro to receive any
favors by reason of his race any more than he wanted him
to be discriminated against on that account. He wanted
all human beings, Negroes among the rest, to receive their
deserts as individuals regardless of their race, color, 
religion, sex, or any other consideration which has nothing 
to do with the individual's merits. One of his favorite 
figures was that “one cannot hold another in a ditch without
himself staying in the ditch.” There is not a single right
<pb id="washi105" n="105"/>
for which he contended for his people which if won would
not directly or indirectly benefit all other people. Were
they in all the States admitted to the franchise on equal
terms with white citizens what Mr. Washington termed
the “encouragement of vice and ignorance among white
citizens” would cease.</p>
          <p>Were the lynching of Negroes stopped the lynching of
white men would also cease. Both the innocent black
man and the innocent white man would feel a greater sense
of security while the guilty black man as well as the guilty
white man would be less secure. Were the Negroes given
their full share of public education the whites would gain
not only more reliable and intelligent Negro labor, but
would be largely freed so far as Negroes are concerned
from the menace of the crimes of violence which are 
committed almost exclusively by ignorant persons. Finally,
were Negro travellers given equal accommodations and
treatment for equal rates on all the Southern railways the
volume of Negro travel would more rapidly increase, thus
increasing the prosperity of the railways and their 
shareholders which would in turn promote the prosperity 
of the entire South.</p>
          <p>True to his policy of always placing the emphasis upon
those things which are encouraging instead of upon those
things which are discouraging, Mr. Washington concluded
the already much-quoted article, “Is the Negro Having a
Fair <sic corr="Chance?&quot;">Chance?</sic> with these observations: “Notwithstanding
all the defects in our system of dealing with him, the Negro
in this country owns more property, lives in better houses,
<pb id="washi106" n="106"/>
is in a larger measure encouraged in business, wears better
clothes, eats better food, has more schoolhouses and
churches, and more teachers and ministers, than any
similar group of Negroes anywhere in the world.”</p>

          <head>CHAPTER FIVE</head>
          <head>MEETING RACE PREJUDICE</head>
          <p>ALTHOUGH intensely human and consumingly interested 
in humanity—both in the mass and as individuals, 
whether of his own race or any other—Booker
Washington thought and acted to an uncommon degree
on the impersonal plane. This characteristic was 
perhaps most strikingly illustrated in his attitude toward
race prejudice. When, many years ago, he had charge
of the Indian students at Hampton, and had occasion to
travel with them, he found they were free to occupy in the
hotels any rooms they could pay for, whereas he must
either go without or take a room in the servants' quarters.
He regarded these experiences as interesting illustrations
of the illogical nature of race prejudice. The occupants of
these hotels did not resent mingling with members of a
backward race whose skin happened to be red, but they
did object to mingling on the same terms with members of
another backward race whose skin happened to be black.
It apparently never entered his head to regard this 
discrimination with bitterness or as a personal rebuff. One
could not, however, make a greater mistake than to assume
from this impersonal attitude that he condoned race 
prejudice, or in any sense stood as an apologist for it. To
<pb id="washi108" n="108"/>
dispel any such idea one has only to recall his speech at 
the Peace Jubilee in Chicago after the Spanish War, from
which we have already quoted, and in which he characterized 
racial prejudice as “a cancer gnawing at the heart of
the Republic, that shall one day prove as dangerous as an
attack from an army without or within.”</p>
          <p>Very early in his career Washington worked out for
himself a perfectly definite line of conduct in the matter of
social mingling with white people. In the South he 
scrupulously observed the local customs and avoided offending
the prejudices of the Southerners in so far as was possible
without unduly handicapping his work. For instance, in
his constant travelling throughout the South he not only
violated their customs, but oftentimes their laws, in using
sleeping cars, but this he was obliged to do because he
could spare neither the time to travel by day nor the
strength and energy to sit up all night. This particular
Southern prejudice and the laws predicated upon it he was
hence forced to violate, but he did so as a physical necessity
to the accomplishment of his work and not in any sense as a
defiance of custom or law. While in the South he 
observed Southern customs and bowed to Southern prejudices,
but he declined to be bound by such customs, laws, and
prejudices when in other parts of this country or the
world. Except in the South he allowed himself whatever
degree of social intercourse with the whites seemed best
calculated to accomplish his immediate object and his 
ultimate aims. He never accepted purely social invitations
from white persons. He always claimed that he could best
<pb id="washi109" n="109"/>
satisfy his social desires among his own people. He 
believed that the question of so-called “social equality” 
between the races was too academic and meaningless to be
worthy of serious discussion.</p>
          <p>Probably he never made a more well-considered or 
illuminating statement of his personal attitude toward
social intercourse with the dominant race than in a letter
to the late Edgar Gardiner Murphy, a Southerner “of
light and leading,” author of “The Present South,” “The
Basis of Ascendancy,” and other notable books on the
relations between the races. Mr. Murphy, as a Southerner, 
became alarmed at the attacks upon Booker Washington 
by certain Southern newspapers and public men
because of his appearance at so-called social functions
in the North. Mr. Murphy, rightly regarding the retention 
of the favorable opinion of representative Southern
whites as essential to the success of Washington's work,
very naturally feared any course of action which seemed
to threaten the continuance of that favorable opinion.
In response to a letter in which Mr. Murphy expressed
these fears and asked for an opportunity to discuss the
situation with him Mr. Washington replied as follows:</p>
          <q type="letter" direct="unspecified">
            <text>
              <body>

                  <p>MY DEAR SIR: I have received your kind letter, for
which I thank you very much. I was very much disappointed 
that I did not have an opportunity of meeting you,
as I had planned the other day, so as not to be so hurried
in talking with you as I usually am. I shall be very glad,
however, the very first time I can find another spare hour
<pb id="washi110" n="110"/>
when in New York (Mr. Murphy was then living in New
York City) to have you talk with me fully and frankly
about the matters that are in your mind.</p>
                  <p>However we may differ in our view regarding certain
matters, there is no man in the country whose frankness,
earnestness, and sincere disinterestedness I respect more
than yours, and whatever you say always has great weight
with me.</p>
                  <p>Your letter emphasizes the tremendous difficulty of
the work at the South. In most cases, and in most 
countries where a large section of the people are down, and
are to be helped up, those attempting to do the work
have before them a straight, simple problem of elevating
the unfortunate people without the entanglement of racial
prejudice to be grappled with. I think I do not 
exaggerate when I say that perhaps a third or half of the
thought and energy of those engaged in the elevation of
the colored people is given in the direction of trying to do
the thing or not doing the thing which would enhance
racial prejudice. This feature of the situation I believe
very few people at the North or at the South appreciate.
What is true of the Negro educator is true in a smaller
degree of the white educator at the South. I am 
constantly trying, as best I can, to study the situation as
it is right here on the ground, and I may be mistaken,
but aside from the wild and demagogical talk on the part
of a few I am unable to discover much or any change in
the attitude of the best white people toward the best
colored people. So far as my own individual experience
and observation are concerned, I am treated about the
same as I have always been. I was in Athens, Georgia,
a few days ago, to deliver an address before the colored
people at the State Fair, and the meeting was attended
by the best class of whites and the best class of
<pb id="washi111" n="111"/>
colored people, who seemed to be pleased over what I
said.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Blank, a Southern Congressman, just now is making a
good deal of noise, but you will recall that Mr. Blank spoke
just as bitterly against me before Mr. Roosevelt became
President as he has since. I do not want to permit myself
to be misled, but I repeat that I cannot see or feel that any
great alienation has taken place between the two classes
of people that you refer to.</p>
                  <p>For the sake of argument I want to grant for the moment
a thing which I have never done before, even in a private
letter, and which is very distasteful to me, and that is,
that I am the leader of the colored people. Do you think
it will ever be possible for one man to be set up as the
leader of ten millions of people, meaning a population
nearly twice as large as that of the Dominion of Canada
and nearly equal to that of the Republic of Mexico, without 
the actions of that individual being carefully watched
and commented upon, and what he does being exaggerated
either in one direction or the other? Again, if I am the
leader and therefore the mouthpiece for ten millions of
colored people, is it possible for such a leader to avoid
coming into contact with the representatives of the ruling
classes of white people upon many occasions; and is it
not to be expected that when questions that are racial,
and national and international in their character are to
be discussed, that such a representative of the Negro
race would be sought out both by individuals and by
conventions? If, as you kindly suggest, I am the leader,
I hardly see how such notoriety and prominence as will
naturally come can be wholly or in any large degree
avoided.</p>
                  <p>Judging by some of the criticisms that have appeared
recently, mainly from the class of people to whom I have
<pb id="washi112" n="112"/>
referred, it seems to me that some of the white people at
the South are making an attempt to control my actions
when I am in the North and in Europe. Heretofore,
no man has been more careful to regard the feelings of
the Southern people in actions and words than I have
been, and this policy I shall continue to pursue, but I
have never attempted to hide or to minimize the fact
that when I am out of the South I do not conform to
the same customs and rules that I do in the South. I
say I have not attempted to hide it because everything
that I have done in this respect was published four years
ago in my book, “Up from Slavery,” which has been
read widely throughout the South, and I did not hear a
word of adverse criticism passed upon what I had done.
For fifteen years I have been doing at the North just
what I have been doing during the past year. I have
never attended a purely social function given by white
people anywhere in the country. Nearly every week I
receive invitations to weddings of rich people, but these
I always refuse. Mrs. Washington almost never 
accompanies me on any occasion where there can be the least
sign of purely social intercourse. Whenever I meet
white people in the North at their offices, in their parlors,
or at their dinner tables, or at banquets, it is with me
purely a matter of business, either in the interest of our
institution or in the interest of my race; no other thought
ever enters my mind. For me to say now, after fifteen
years of creating interest in my race and in this 
institution in that manner, that I must stop, would simply 
mean that I must cease to get money in a large measure for
this institution. In meeting the people in this way I
am simply doing what the head of practically every school,
black and white, in the South is constantly doing. For
purely social pleasure I have always found all my ambitions
<pb id="washi113" n="113"/>
satisfied among my own people, and you will find that in
proportion as the colored race becomes educated and
prosperous, in the same proportion is this true of all
colored people.</p>
                  <p>I said a minute ago that I had tried to be careful in
regard to the feelings of the Southern people. It has
been urged upon me time and time again to employ a
number of white teachers at this institution. I have
not done so and do not intend to do so, largely for the
reason that they would be constantly mingling with each 
other at the table. For thirty years and more, in every 
one of our Southern States, white and colored people have 
sat down to the table three times a day nearly throughout 
the year, and I have heard very little criticism passed
upon them. This kind of thing, however, at Tuskegee
I have always tried to avoid so far as our regular teaching
force is concerned. But I repeat, if I begin to yield in the
performance of my duty when out of the South in one
respect, I do not know where the end will be. It is very
difficult for you, or any other person who is not in my
place, to understand the difficulty and embarrassment
that I am confronted with. You have no idea how many
invitations of various kinds I am constantly refusing or
trying to get away from because I want to avoid 
embarrassing situations. For example, over a year ago Mr.
S——invited me to go to Stockbridge, Massachusetts,
near Lenox, to deliver an address on General Armstrong's
life and work. When I reached Stockbridge an hour or
so before the time of delivering the address, I found
that Mr. S——, who had invited me, had also invited
five or six other gentlemen to meet me at luncheon. The
luncheon I knew nothing about until I reached the town.
Under such circumstances I am at a loss to know how
I could have avoided accepting the invitation. A few
<pb id="washi114" n="114"/>
days afterward I filled a long-standing invitation to lecture
at Amherst College. I reached the town a few hours
before dinner and found that a number of people, including 
several college presidents, had been invited to meet
me at dinner. Taking still another case: over a year ago
I promised a colored club in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
that I would be their guest at a banquet in October. The
banquet was held on the third of the month, and when I
reached Cambridge I found that in addition to the members 
of the colored club, the Mayor of the city and a
number of Harvard professors, including President Eliot,
had been invited; and I could go on and state case after
case. Of course, if I wanted to make a martyr of myself
and draw especial attention to me and to the institution,
I could easily do so by simply writing whenever I receive
an invitation to a dinner or banquet that I could not
accept on account of the color of my skin.</p>
                  <p>Six years ago at the Peace Jubilee in Chicago, where I
spoke at a meeting at which President McKinley was
present, I took both luncheon and dinner in the same
dining-room with President McKinley and was the guest
of the same club that he was a guest of. There were
Southern men present, and the fact that I was present
and spoke was widely heralded throughout the South, and
so far as I know not a word of adverse comment was made.
For nearly fifteen years the addresses which I have been
constantly making at dinners and banquets in the North
have been published throughout the South, and no 
adverse comment has been made regarding my presence on
these occasions.</p>
                  <p>Practically all of the invitations to functions that are
of even a semi-social character are urged upon me by
Northern people, and very often after I have refused to
accept invitations pressure is brought to bear on special
<pb id="washi115" n="115"/>
friends of mine in order to get me to accept. 
Notwithstanding all this, where I accept one invitation I 
refuse ten; in fact, you have no idea how many invitations to
dinner I refuse while I am in the North. I not only do
so for the reason that I do not care to excite undue 
criticism, but for the further reason that if I were to 
accept any large proportion of such invitations I would 
have little time left for my legitimate work. In many cases 
the invitations come from people who do not give money
but simply want to secure a notoriety or satisfy curiosity.</p>
                  <p>I have stated the case as I see it, and with a view of
having you think over these matters by the time that
we meet.</p>

          <p>There were two particularly notable occasions upon
which Mr. Washington unwittingly stirred the prejudices
of the South. The first was when in 1901 he dined with
President Roosevelt and his family at the White House;
the second, when four years later he dined with Mr. John
Wanamaker and his daughter at a hotel in Saratoga,
New York.</p>
          <p>The truth of his dining at the White House, of which
so many imaginary versions have been given, was this:
having received so many expressions of approval from all
sections of the country on his appointment of ex-Governor
Jones to a Federal judgeship in Alabama, which appointment 
was made, as described in a previous chapter, on
the recommendation of Booker Washington and Grover
Cleveland, President Roosevelt asked him to come to the
<pb id="washi116" n="116"/>
White House and discuss with him some further appointments 
and other matters of mutual interest.</p>
          <p>On arriving in Washington he went to the home of his
friend, Whitefield McKinlay, a colored man with whom
he usually stopped when in the Capital. The next 
morning he went to the White House by appointment for an
interview with the President. Since they did not have
time to finish their discussion, the President, in accordance
with the course he had often followed with others under
similar circumstances, invited Washington to come to 
dinner so that they might finish their discussion in the 
evening without loss of time.</p>
          <p>In response to this oral invitation he went to the White
House at the appointed time, dined with the President
and his family and two other guests, and after dinner
discussed with the President chiefly the character of 
individual colored office holders or applicants for office 
and, as says Colonel Roosevelt, “the desirability in specific
cases, notably in all offices having to do with the 
administration of justice, of getting high-minded and fearless
white men into office—men whom we could be sure would
affirmatively protect the law-abiding Negro's right to life,
liberty, and property just exactly as they protected the
rights of law-abiding white men.” Also they discussed
the public service of the South so far as the representatives
of the Federal Administration were concerned—the
subject upon which President Roosevelt had wished to 
consult him. The next day the bare fact that he had dined
with the President was obscurely announced by the 
<pb id="washi117" n="117"/>
Washington papers as a routine item of White House news. Some
days later, however, an enterprising correspondent for a
Southern paper lifted this unpretentious item from oblivion 
and sent it to his paper to be blazoned forth in a front-page
headline. For days and weeks thereafter the Southern press
fairly shrieked with the news of this quiet dinner. The very
papers which had most loudly praised the President for his
appointment of a Southern Democrat to a Federal judgeship
now execrated him for inviting to dine with him the man upon
whose recommendation he had made this appointment.</p>
          <p>Mr. Washington was also roundly abused for his
“presumption” in daring to dine at the White House. This was
a little illogical in view of the well-known fact that an 
invitation to the White House is a summons rather than an 
invitation in the ordinary sense. Neither President 
Roosevelt nor Mr. Washington issued any statements by way 
of explanation or apology. While it was, of course, farthest 
from the wishes of either to offend the sensibilities of 
the South, neither one—the many statements to the 
contrary, notwithstanding—ever indicated subsequently 
any regret or admitted that the incident was a mistake.</p>
          <p>During the furore over this incident both the President and
Mr. Washington received many threats against their lives. The
President had the Secret Service to protect him, while Mr.
Washington had no such reliance. His coworkers surrounded
him with such precautions as they could, and his secretary
accumulated during this period enough threatening letters to
fill a desk drawer. It was
<pb id="washi118" n="118"/>
not discovered until some years after that one of these 
threats had been followed by the visit to Tuskegee of a 
hired assassin. A strange Negro was hurt in jumping off the 
train before it reached the Tuskegee Institute station. 
There being no hospital for Negroes in the town of Tuskegee 
he was taken to the hospital of the Institute, where he was 
cared for and nursed for several weeks before he was able 
to leave. Mr. Washington was absent in the North during 
all of this time. Many months later this Negro confessed 
that he had come to Tuskegee in the pay of a group of 
white men in Louisiana for the purpose of assassinating 
Booker Washington. He said that he became so ashamed of 
himself while being cared for by the doctors and nurses 
employed by the very man he had come to murder that he left 
as soon as he was able to do so instead of waiting to carry 
out his purpose on the return of his victim, as he had
originally planned to do.</p>
          <p>Booker Washington, with all his philosophy and capacity for
rising above the personal, was probably more deeply pained by
this affair than any other in his whole career. His pain was,
however, almost solely on Mr. Roosevelt's account. He felt
keenly hurt and chagrined that Mr. Roosevelt, whom he so
intensely admired, and who was doing so much, not only for 
his own race but for the whole South as he believed, should 
suffer all this abuse and even vilification on his account. 
President Roosevelt evidently realized something of how he 
felt, for in a letter to him written at this time he added 
this postscript: “By the way, don't worry about <hi rend="italics">me</hi>; it will 
all come right in time,
<pb id="washi119" n="119"/>
and if I have helped by ever so little ‘the ascent of man’ I
am more than satisfied.”</p>
          <p>Probably no single public event ever gave Booker
Washington greater pleasure than Colonel Roosevelt's
triumphant election to the Presidency in 1904. The day
after the election he wrote the President the following
letter:</p>

                  <p>MY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I cannot find words in which
to express my feeling regarding the tremendous outcome
of Tuesday's election. I know that you feel the sacred
and almost divine confidence imposed. In my opinion,
no human being in America since Washington, perhaps,
has been so honored and vindicated. The result shows
that the great heart of the American people beats true and
is in the direction of fair play for all, regardless of 
race or color. Nothing has ever occurred which has given me
more faith in all races or shows more plainly that they
will respond to high ideals when properly appealed to.</p>
                  <p>I know that you will not misunderstand me when I say
I share somewhat the feeling of triumph and added 
responsibility that must animate your soul at the present
time because of the personal abuse heaped upon you on
account of myself. The great victory and vindication
does not make me feel boastful or vainglorious, but, on
the other hand, very humble, and gives me more faith in
humanity and makes me more determined to work harder
in the interest of all our people of both races regardless of
race or color. I shall urge our people everywhere to 
manifest their gratitude by showing a spirit of meekness and
<pb id="washi120" n="120"/>
added usefulness. The election shows to what a great
height you have already lifted the character of American
citizenship. Before you leave the White House I am
sure that the whole South will understand you and love
you.</p>
                  <p>God keep you and bless you.</p>

                  <p>MY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: It will interest you to know
that the Cox family, over whom such a disturbance was
made in connection with the Indianola, Miss., post-office,
have started a bank in that same town which direct and
reliable information convinces me is in a prosperous 
condition. The bank has the confidence of both races. It is a
curious circumstance that while objection was made to this
black family being at the head of the post-office no 
objection is made to this black man being president of a bank
in the same town.</p>
                  <p>A letter just received from a reliable banker in 
Mississippi contains the following sentences:
<pb id="washi121" n="121"/>
“Now, with reference to Mr. W. W. Cox, of Indianola,
Miss., I beg to advise that no man of color is as highly
regarded and respected by the white people of his town
and county as he. It is true that he organized and is
cashier of the Delta Penny Savings Bank, domiciled there.
I visited Indianola during the spring of 1905 and was very
much surprised to note the esteem in which he was held by
the bankers and business men (white) of that place. He
is a good, clean man and above the average in intelligence,
and knows how to handle the typical Southern white man.
In the last statement furnished by his bank to the State
Auditor, his bank showed total resources of $46,000. He
owns and lives in one of the best resident houses in 
Indianola, regardless of race, and located in a part of the
town where other colored men seem to be not desired.
The whites adjacent to him seem to be his friends. He
has a large plantation near the town, worth $35,000
or $40,000. He is a director in Mr. Pettiford's bank
at Birmingham, Ala., and I think is vice-president of
the same. He also owns stock in the bank of Mound
Bayou.”</p>

and his work for many years. Mr. Washington accepted
this invitation without the least thought of reawakening
the clamor caused by the Roosevelt dinner. The dinner
itself passed off quietly, pleasantly, and without particular
event. It was not until he took up the papers at his little
hotel in New York the next morning that he found that he
had again stirred up a hornet's nest similar to that of four
years before. The denunciation was if anything more
violent; for, as many of his assailants said, he should have
profited by the protests of four years before. In an 
editorial entitled, “Booker Washington's Saratoga 
Performance” a Southern newspaper said: “Since the fateful 
day when Booker T. Washington sat down to the dinner table
in the White House with President Roosevelt he has done
many things to hurt the cause of which he is regarded as
the foremost man. . . . Leaving out of the question
the lack of delicacy and self-respect manifested by 
Wanamaker and his family, blame must rest upon Washington,
because he knows how deep and impassable is the gulf
between whites and blacks in the South when the social
situation is involved. He deliberately flaunts all this in
the face of the Southern people among whom he is living
and among whom his work has to be carried on. He
could have given no harder knock to his institution than
he gave when he marched into that Saratoga dinner room
with a white woman and her father.”</p>
          <p>These sentiments were expressed editorially by another
Southern paper: “Wanamaker is unworthy to shine the
shoes of Booker Washington. He is not in Washington's
<pb id="washi123" n="123"/>
class. If the truly smart set of Saratoga was shocked that
Booker should have been caught in this man's company
and as his guest we are not surprised. But still Booker
Washington could not eat dinner with the most ordinary
white man in this section. He wouldn't dare intimate
that he sought such social recognition among whites here”;
and in conclusion this editorial said: “The South only
pities the daughter that she should have allowed herself
to be used by a father whose sensibilities and ideas of the
proprieties are so dulled by his asinine qualities that he
could not see the harm in it.”</p>
          <p>This vituperation of Mr. Wanamaker, and the scoring
him for his part in the affair even more than Washington,
recalls an incident which Mr. Washington himself relates
in his book entitled, “My Larger Education.” When he
was making a trip through Florida, a few weeks after his
dinner with President Roosevelt, at a little station near
Gainesville, “A white man got aboard the train,” he
says, “whose dress and manner indicated that he was
from the class of small farmers in that part of the 
country. He shook hands with me very cordially, and said:
‘I am mighty glad to see you. I have heard about
you and I have been wanting to meet you for a long
while.’</p>
          <p>“I was naturally pleased at this cordial reception, but
I was surprised when, after looking me over, he remarked:
‘Say, you are a great man. You are the greatest man in
this country.’</p>
          <p>“I protested mildly, but he insisted, shaking his head
<pb id="washi124" n="124"/>
and repeating, ‘Yes, sir, the greatest man in this country.’
Finally I asked him what he had against President Roosevelt, 
telling him at the same time that, in my opinion,
the President of the United States was the greatest man
in the country.</p>
          <p>“‘Huh! Roosevelt?’ he replied, with considerable 
emphasis in his voice, ‘I used to think that Roosevelt was 
a great man until he ate dinner with you. That settled
him for me.’”</p>
          <p>Mr. Washington goes on to say: “This remark of a
Florida farmer is but one of the many experiences which
have taught me something of the curious nature of this
thing that we call prejudice—social prejudice, race 
prejudice, and all the rest. I have come to the conclusion 
that these prejudices are something that it does not pay to 
disturb. It is best to ‘let sleeping dogs lie.’ All sections
of the United States, like all other parts of the world,
have their own peculiar customs and prejudices. For
that reason it is the part of common sense to respect them.
When one goes to European countries, or into the Far
West, or into India or China, he meets certain customs
and certain prejudices which he is bound to respect and,
to a certain extent, comply with. The same holds good
regarding conditions in the North and in the South. In
the South it is not the custom for colored and white people
to be entertained at the same hotel; it is not the custom
for black and white children to attend the same school.
In most parts of the North a different custom prevails. I
have never stopped to question or quarrel with the customs
<pb id="washi125" n="125"/>
of the people in the part of the country in which I found
myself.”</p>
          <p>And so he acted in the case of the Wanamaker dinner. He
accepted Mr. Wanamaker's invitation because he was in the
North and his host was a Northerner. In so doing he felt 
that he was not violating any generally accepted custom or
universally entertained prejudice of the part of the country 
in which he found himself. Had the inconceivable occurred, 
and had a Southerner invited him to dine in the South, under
conditions in all other respects identical, he would not have
accepted. He would not have been willing to incur the
resentment of the South even had his host been willing to 
defy local prejudices by inviting him. On the other hand, he 
felt that the attitude of those who would seek to control 
him in matters of social custom when he was not in the South 
or among Southerners was unfair and unreasonable.</p>
          <p>An incident which occurred while he was stopping at the
English Hotel in Indianapolis in 1903 furnished copy for the
more or less sensational press of the country. This hotel does
not as a rule accept Negroes as guests, but Mr. Washington
was always a welcome visitor there just as he was at many
other hotels where less-favored members of his race were
excluded. He never patronized this hotel or any other for the
purpose of asserting his rights, but merely to obtain the
comforts and the seclusion so essential to a man who always
worked up to the limits of even his great strength and 
usually a little beyond such limits. It is, indeed, quite 
possible that he might have lived longer had he
<pb id="washi126" n="126"/>
been free to stop at hotels in the South instead of 
undergoing the constant wear and tear of being entertained in
the private homes of the all-too-kind hosts of his own race.
All public men and lecturers, in a large way of business,
learn early in their careers that they must decline 
practically all proffers of private hospitality if they are 
to preserve their health.</p>
          <p>On this occasion the white chambermaid assigned to care
for the room he occupied refused to perform her duties so
far as his room was concerned on the ground, as she stated,
that she “would not clean up after a nigger.” For this 
refusal to do her work the management discharged her. The
Springfield <hi rend="italics">Republican</hi> of that date thus describes what
followed: “A hotel at Houston, Texas, immediately
offered her a place there, which she accepted, but as 
matters are now going she is more likely to retire from the
business as a grand lady living on an independent income.
Her name is upon all tongues in the Southland, and the
newspapers print long and complimentary accounts of her
life and the one great deed that has made her famous.
Citizens and communities vie with each other in 
contributing money. . . . Captain John W. Johnson
of Sheffield, Ala., is organizing a general subscription
fund from that and neighboring towns. A meeting at
Houston, Texas, raised $500 for her in the name of a 
‘self-respecting girl.’ The Houston <hi rend="italics">Chronicle</hi> is conducting
another popular subscription. Contributions are coming
into it from all parts of Texas. Citizens of New Orleans
have raised $1,000. About twoscore Southern towns and
<pb id="washi127" n="127"/>
a dozen cities so far figure in the contributions. The 
movement extends to Indianapolis, where a gold watch has been
contributed.” The hysterical lauding of this “heroine”
was subsequently wet blanketed by the discovery that she
had cared for Mr. Washington's room for the first day or
two of his stay without protest, and by the further 
discovery that her second or third husband had recently 
obtained a divorce from her.</p>
          <p>It is only fair to add that many of the leading citizens
of the South strongly deprecated the sensational 
magnifying of this trivial incident by a certain section of 
the Southern press. Mr. Washington declined to make
any comment for publication during or after this petty
tumult.</p>
          <p>In spite of the three events described, and others of a like
nature that might be mentioned, no Negro was ever so
liked, respected, admired, and eulogized by the Southern
whites as Booker Washington. The day following his
great speech before the Cotton States Exposition in Atlanta
in 1895 when he went out upon the streets of the city he
was so besieged by white citizens from the highest to
the lowest, who wanted to shake his hand and congratulate 
him, that he was fairly driven in self-defense to remain
indoors. Not many years after that it had become a 
commonplace for him to be an honored guest on important
public occasions throughout the South. On occasions too
numerous even to note in passing he was welcomed, and
introduced to great audiences, by Southern Governors,
Mayors, and other high officials, as well as by eminent
<pb id="washi128" n="128"/>
private citizens. Such recognition came partly as a
spontaneous tribute to the great work he was doing and
partly because of his constantly reiterated assurance that
the Negro was not seeking either political domination over
the white man or social intercourse with him. He
reasoned that the more Southern whites he could convince
that his people were not seeking what is known as social
equality or political dominance, the less race friction there
would be.</p>
          <p>It has already been mentioned that at the opening of the
first Negro agricultural fair in Albany, Georgia, in the fall
of 1914, the Mayor of the city and several members of the
City Council sat on the platform during the exercises and
listened to his speech with most spontaneous and obvious
approval. In this part of Georgia the Negroes outnumber 
the whites by at least six to one. The afternoon of the
same day the Mayor invited Booker Washington and his
party to come to the city hall and confer with himself, the
other city officials, and a group of prominent private 
citizens on the relations between the races in that city and
locality. At this conference there was a friendly, easy
interchange of ideas interspersed with jokes and laughter,
but all the time Mr. Washington was leading them step by
step to see that by giving the Negroes proper educational
opportunities they were helping themselves as well as
the Negroes. Mr. Stowe, who was present at this 
conference, noticed to his surprise that some of the 
arguments advanced by Dr. Washington, which seemed to him 
to be almost worn-out truisms, although freshly and strongly
<pb id="washi129" n="129"/>
expressed, were seized upon by his auditors as new and 
original ideas. When he made this observation to Mr. 
Washington after the meeting he said that several other 
Northerners had under similar circumstances made the same 
observation and then he added: “I only wish that it were 
possible for me to spend several months of each year 
talking with just such groups of representative Southern 
men. They are always responsive, eager to understand what 
we are driving at, and sympathetic when they do understand. 
The necessity for raising money has forced us to devote the 
bulk of our time to educating the Northern public to the 
needs of the situation to the neglect of our Southern 
white neighbors right here about us.”</p>
          <p>It was an interesting illustration of the illogical workings 
of race prejudice that this man to whom the city fathers 
from the Mayor down gave up practically their entire day—
this man to whom the city hall was thrown open and at whose 
feet sat the leading citizens as well as the officials of 
the city, could not have found shelter in any hotel in town. 
This man whom the officials and other leading citizens 
delighted to honor arrived at night on a Pullman sleeping 
car in violation of the law of the State; and, after all 
possible honor had been paid him, save allowing him to enter 
a hotel, departed the next night by a Pullman sleeper in 
violation of the law!</p>
          <p>This constant “law-breaker” was welcomed and introduced
to audiences by Governor Blanchard of Louisiana at
Shreveport, La.; by Governor Candler at Atlanta,
<pb id="washi130" n="130"/>
Ga.; by Governor Donaghey at Little Rock, Ark.; by Governor
McCorkle of West Virginia, and successively by Governors
Jelks and O'Neil of his own State of Alabama. Still other
Southern Governors spoke from the same platform with him at
congresses, conventions, and meetings of various descriptions.</p>
          <p>Next to South Carolina and Georgia, perhaps no State in the
Union has shown as much hostility to the progress of the Negro
as Mississippi. In 1908, in response to the urgent appeals of
Charles Banks, the Negro banker and dominating force of the
Negro town of Mound Bayou, Mr. Washington agreed to make a
tour through Mississippi such as he had made three years 
before through Arkansas and what were then Oklahoma and Indian
Territories. At Jackson, Miss., the management of the State 
Fair Association offered the local committee of Negroes the 
great Liberal Arts Building for Mr. Washington's address. In 
the audience were not less than five thousand persons, among 
them several hundred white citizens. Among the whites who 
sat on the platform were Governor Noel, Lieutenant-Governor 
Manship, Bishop Charles B. Galloway of the Methodist 
Episcopal Church South, Mr. Milsaps, the richest citizen of 
the State; the postmaster of Jackson, the United States 
Marshal, Hon. Edgar S. Wilson, and a considerable number of 
other prominent white citizens.</p>
          <p>At Natchez, a few nights later, the audience literally filled
every available space in the Grand Opera House and
overflowed into the adjoining streets. This audience was
<pb id="washi131" n="131"/>
in many respects the most remarkable that the city had ever 
seen. The entire orchestra was given over to the white 
citizens of Natchez and Adams County, and still there was 
not room to accommodate them, for they were packed in the 
rear and stood three and four deep in the aisles. The 
colored people were crowded into the balcony and the 
galleries. When Booker Washington arose to speak, he was 
greeted by a perfect whirlwind of applause and cheering. He 
was visibly affected by the reception given him by whites 
as well as blacks.</p>
          <p>When he finished speaking a large delegation headed by the
Mayor of the city made their way to the platform, welcomed
him to the city, thanked him for his address, and stated 
that his influence for good in the city and county could 
not be estimated.</p>
          <p>Mr. J. T. Harahan, of the Illinois Central Railroad, provided
the Pullman tourist car in which Mr. Washington and his party
toured the State. It was estimated that from sixty to eighty
thousand people saw and heard him during his seven days' trip.
On the conclusion of the tour one paper said, “No more popular
man ever came into the State, white or black, and no man ever
spoke to larger audiences than he did. He is the only speaker
who ever filled the Jackson, Miss., Coliseum.”</p>
          <p>Only six months before his death Booker Washington made a
similar tour through Louisiana. Louisiana has always been
reputed to be in the same category as Mississippi in opposing
Negro progress. To some of his audiences Mr. Washington said
that he and his party of twenty-five
<pb id="washi132" n="132"/>
colored men had felt before they started very much like the
little girl who was about to go on a trip to Louisiana with
her parents. The night before they started she said her
prayer as usual:
<q direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“Now I lay me down to sleep</l><l>I pray the Lord my soul to keep.</l><l>If I should die before I wake,</l><l>I pray the Lord my soul to take.”</l></lg></q>
With a deep sigh she then added, “Good-bye, Lord, for two
weeks. We are going down to Louisiana.”</p>
          <p>In introducing Mr. Washington to a great audience in
New Orleans, made up of both races, Mayor Berhman said,
turning to Booker Washington:</p>
          <p>“The work you are doing for the uplift of your people
means untold good to the great State of Louisiana and to
the whole country. Nowhere has your race greater
opportunities than in Louisiana. If the people of the
Negro race will follow your teachings, they will help
materially to bring about a condition that will mean much
for Louisiana, the South, and the nation.”</p>
          <p>At Shreveport former Governor N. C. Blanchard, in
introducing Dr. Washington to an audience of over 10,000
white and colored citizens, said: “I am glad to see this
goodly attendance of white people, representative white
people at that, for his Honor, the Mayor, is here, and with
him are members and officials of the city government and
<pb id="washi133" n="133"/>
other prominent citizens of our community. They are here
to give encouragement to Mr. Washington, to hold up his
hands, for they know that he is leading his people along
right lines—lines tending to promote better feeling and
better understanding between the two races. . . .</p>
          <p>“Our country needs to have white and black people,
sober, honest, frugal, and thrifty. Booker T. Washington
stands for these things. He advises and counsels and
leads toward these goals. Hear him and heed his
words.”</p>
          <p>At the invitation of Superintendent Gwinn the colored
school children of New Orleans were given a half-holiday
to hear Dr. Washington. He addressed them in an arena
seating more than five thousand people, which was given
for the occasion by its white owner.</p>
          <p>To one of these Louisiana audiences Mr. Washington
said: “Both races in the South suffer at the hands of
public opinion by reason of the fact that the outside
world hears of our difficulties, of crimes, mobs, and 
lynchings, but it does not hear of or know about the 
evidences of racial friendship and good-will which exist 
in the majority of communities in Louisiana and other 
Southern States where black and white people live together 
in such large numbers. Lynchings are widely reported by 
telegraph. The quiet, effective work of devoted white 
people in the South for Negro uplift is not generally or 
widely reported. The best white citizenship must take 
charge of the mob and not have the mob take charge of 
civilization. There is enough wisdom, patience, forbearance, 
and common
<pb id="washi134" n="134"/>
sense in the South for white people and black people to live
together in peace for all time.”</p>
          <p>In short, Booker Washington met race prejudice just as
he did all other difficulties, as an obstacle to be 
surmounted rather than as an injustice to be railed at and 
denounced regardless of the consequences.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER SIX</head>
          <head>GETTING CLOSE TO THE PEOPLE</head>
          <p>ONE secret of Booker Washington's leadership was that
he always had his ear to the ground and his feet on
the ground. Some one has said that “a practical idealist 
is a man who keeps his feet on the ground even though
his head is in the clouds.” Booker Washington was
that kind of an idealist. He kept in constant and 
intimate touch with the masses of his people, particularly
with those on the soil. Like the giant in the fable who
doubled his strength every time he touched the ground,
Booker Washington seemed to renew his strength every
time he came in contact with the plain people of his race,
particularly the farmers. No matter how pressed and
driven by multifarious affairs, he could always find time
for a rambling talk, apparently quite at random, with an
old, uneducated, ante-bellum black farmer. Sometimes he
would halt the entire business of a national convention in
order to hear the comment of some simple but shrewd old
character. He had a profound respect for the wisdom of
simple people who lived at close grips with the realities of
life.</p>
          <p>At the 1914 meeting of the National Negro Business
League at Muskogee, Okla., a Mr. Jake——, who had
<pb id="washi136" n="136"/>
started as an ignorant orphan boy, delighted Mr. 
Washington's heart when he testified: “When I first started 
out I lived in a chicken house, 12 x 14 feet; now I own a 
ten-room residence, comfortably furnished, and in a 
settlement where we have a good school, a good church, and
plenty of amusement, including ten children.”</p>
          <p>After the laughter and applause had subsided Mr.
Washington asked: “Do you think there is the same kind
of an opening out here in Oklahoma for other and younger
men of our race to do as you have done and to succeed
equally as well?”</p>
          <p>To which Mr. Jake replied: “ . . . I think I have
succeeded with little or no education, and it stands to
reason that some of the graduates from these industrial
and agricultural schools ought to be able to do better than
I have done.”</p>
          <p>Which was, of course, just the answer Mr. Washington
hoped he would make.</p>
          <p>Mr. Washington's instinct for keeping close to the plain
people was perhaps best illustrated by his tours through
the far Southern States for the improvement of the living
conditions of his people, the tours to which allusion has
several times been made. His insistence upon cleanliness,
neatness, and paint became so well known that his 
approach to a community frequently caused frantic cleaning
up of yards, mending of gates, and painting of houses.
These sudden converts to paint sometimes found out from
which side the great man was to approach their house and
painted only that side and the front.</p>

          </p>
          <pb id="washi137" n="137"/>
          <p>When he spoke to his people on these trips he had the
faculty of becoming one of them. He described their
daily lives in their own language. He told them how much
land they owned, how much of it was mortgaged, how
much and what they raised, and in fact every vital 
economic and social fact about their lives and the conditions
about them. He praised them for what was creditable,
censured and bantered them for what was bad, and told
them what conditions should be and how they could make
them so.</p>
          <p>He made these tours through Mississippi, Tennessee,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Florida, 
Louisiana, and portions of Alabama and Georgia.</p>
          <p>Besides these State tours he would, whenever he could
take the time, shoot out into the country surrounding
Tuskegee Institute to encourage and promote the efforts of
his neighbors of his own race. In July, 1911, accompanied
by some guests and members of his faculty, he made such
a visit to Mt. Olive, a village on the east of Tuskegee.
The party was first taken to the village church where they
found a teeming congregation to greet them. Here Mr.
Washington was introduced by the principal of the
“Washington School” who said that since Mr. Washington's 
visit eighteen months ago the colored people had
purchased forty-one lots, built several new houses, 
whitewashed or painted the old ones, and increased their 
gardens to such an extent that few, if any, had still to
buy their vegetables.</p>
          <p>Mr. Washington opened his talk by saying: “It is an
<pb id="washi138" n="138"/>
inspiration simply to drive through and see your pleasant
houses surrounded by flowers and gardens and all that goes
to make life happy.” He then appealed to the women
to make their homes as attractive on the inside as the
gardens had made them on the outside. He told them
the best receipt for keeping the men and the children at
home and out of mischief was to make the homes so 
attractive that they would not want to go away. Then, as
always, before he closed he put in his warnings and 
injunctions to the derelict: “Paint your houses; if you can't
paint them, whitewash them. Put the men to work in
their spare hours repairing fences, gates, and windows.
Get together in your church, as you have in your schoolwork, 
settle on a pastor and get him to live in your 
community. Pay him in order that he may live here and
become a part of your community.”</p>
          <p>On another such trip through the southwestern part of
Macon County, the county in which Tuskegee is located,
he was once accompanied by Judge Robert H. Terrell, the
Negro Judge of the District of Columbia; the Hon. 
Whitefield McKinlay, the Negro Collector of Customs for the
District of Columbia; George L. Knox, owner and editor
of the Indianapolis <hi rend="italics">Freeman</hi>, a Negro newspaper; W. T. B.
Williams, agent for the Anna T. Jeanes Fund and the
Slater Board; Dr. Thomas Jesse Jones of the United States
Census Bureau, and Lord Eustace Percy, one of the 
Secretaries of the British Embassy at Washington.</p>
          <p>One can well imagine with what pride the simple black
farmers of Macon County displayed their products and
<figure id="ill8" entity="wash138"><p>A party of friends who accompanied Dr. Washington 
on one of his educational tours through the state of Mississippi. In the party are Charles Banks, a leading negro banker and business man of Mississippi; Bishop E. Cottrell, and on Dr. Washington's right, Robert R. Moton, his successor in the work at Tuskegee Instuitute</p></figure>
<pb id="washi139" n="139"/>
their live stock to these distinguished representatives of 
both races headed by their own great neighbor and leader. At 
Mt. Andrew, one of the communities visited, the Farmers'
Improvement Club had prepared an exhibit consisting of the
best specimens of vegetables, fruits, and meats raised in the
community. A report stated that the Negro people of the town
owned over two hundred head of live stock and had over thirty
houses which were either whitewashed or painted. When
called upon for remarks, Mr. Washington expressed himself as
greatly encouraged by what he had seen and said in
conclusion, “Here in Macon County you have good land that
will grow abundant crops. You have also a good citizenship,
and hence there is every opportunity for you to make your
community a heaven upon earth.”</p>
          <p>Booker Washington was always emphasizing the necessity
of better conditions right here and now instead of in a 
distant future or in heaven. He was constantly combating the
tendency in his people—a tendency common to all people 
but naturally particularly strong in those having a heritage 
of slavery—to substitute the anticipated bliss of a 
future life for effective efforts to improve the conditions 
of this present life. He was always telling them to put 
their energies into societies for the preservation of health 
and improvement of living conditions, instead of into the 
too numerous and popular sick benefit and death benefit 
organizations.</p>
          <p>At the next stop of the party Mr. Washington was
introduced to the assembled townspeople by a graduate 
<pb id="washi140" n="140"/>
of Tuskegee Institute, who was one of their leading citizens 
and most successful farmers. In this talk he urged the 
people to get more land and keep it and to grow something 
besides cotton. He said they should not lean upon others 
and should not go to town on Saturdays to “draw upon” the
merchants, but should stay at home and “draw every day from
their own soil corn, peas, beans, and hogs.” He urged the 
men to give their wives more time to work around the house 
and to raise vegetables. (This, of course, instead of 
requiring them to work in the fields with the men as is so 
common.) He urged especially that they take their wives 
into their confidence and make them their partners as well 
as their companions. He assured them that if they took 
their wives into partnership they would accumulate more 
and get along better in every way.</p>
          <p>There was no advice given by him more constantly or
insistently in speaking to the plain people of his race, 
whether in country or city, than this injunction to the 
men to take their wives into their confidence and make them 
their partners. He recognized that the home was the basis 
of all progress and civilization for his race, as well as 
all other races, and that the wife and mother is primarily 
the conservator of the home.</p>
          <p>One of the stops of the trip was at a little hamlet called
Damascus. Here, in characteristic fashion, he told the people
how much richer they were in soil and all natural advantages
than were the inhabitants of the original Damascus in the 
Holy Land. He then argued that having these great natural
advantages, much was to be expected
<pb id="washi141" n="141"/>
of them, etc. Like all great preachers, teachers, and leaders
of men he seized upon the names, incidents, and conditions
immediately about him and from them drew lessons of
fundamental import and universal application.</p>
          <p>The efforts of the Negro farmers on these trips to get a
word of approval from their great leader were often 
pathetic. One old man had a good breed of pigs of which he
was particularly proud. He contrived to be found feeding
them beside the road just as the great man and his party
were passing. The simple ruse succeeded. Mr. Washington 
and his companions stopped and everyone admired
the proud and excited old man's pigs. And then after the
pigs had been duly admired, he led them to a rough plank
table upon which he had displayed in tremulous anticipation 
of this dramatic moment a huge pumpkin, some perfectly 
developed ears of corn, and a lusty cabbage. After
these objects had also been admired the old man decoyed
the party into the little whitewashed cottage where his
wife had her hour of triumph in displaying her jars of
preserves, pickles, cans of vegetables, dried fruits, and 
syrup together with quilts and other needlework all carefully
arranged for this hoped-for inspection.</p>
          <p>The basic teaching of all these tours was: “Make your
own little heaven right here and now. Do it by putting
business methods into your farming, by growing things in
your garden the year around, by building and keeping
attractive and comfortable homes for your children so they
will stay at home and not go to the cities, by keeping your
bodies and your surroundings clean, by staying in one
<pb id="washi142" n="142"/>
place, by getting a good teacher and a good preacher, by
building a good school and church, by letting your wife be
your partner in all you do, by keeping out of debt, by
cultivating friendly relations with your neighbors both white
and black.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Washington was constantly bringing up in the Tuskegee
faculty meetings cases of distress among the colored people
of the county, which he had personally discovered while off
hunting or riding, and planning ways and means to relieve
them. Apparently it never occurred to him that technically, at
least, the fate of these poor persons was not his affair nor 
that of his school. At one such meeting he told of having come
upon while hunting a tumbledown cabin in the woods, within it
a half-paralyzed old Negro obviously unable to care for his
simple wants. Mr. Washington had stopped, built a fire in his
stove, and otherwise made him comfortable temporarily, but
some provision for the old man's care must be made at once.
One of the teachers knew about the old man and stated that
he had such an ugly temper that he had driven off his wife,
son, and daughter who had until recently lived with him and
taken care of him. The young teacher seemed to feel that the
old man had brought his troubles upon his own head and so
deserved little sympathy. Mr. Washington would not for a
moment agree to this. He replied that if the old fellow was so
unfortunate as to have a bad temper as well as his physical
infirmities that was no reason why he should be allowed to
suffer privation. He delegated one of the teachers to look up
the old man's 
<pb id="washi143" n="143"/>
family at once and see if they could be prevailed upon to
support him and to report at the next meeting what had
been arranged. In the meantime he would send some
one out to the cabin daily to take him food and attend to
his wants.</p>
          <p>At another faculty meeting he brought up the plight
of an old woman who was about to be evicted from her
little shack on the outskirts of the town because of her
inability to pay the nominal rent which she was charged.
He arranged to have her rent paid out of a sum of money
which he always had included in the school budget for the
relief of such cases. In such ways he was constantly 
impressing upon his associates the idea that was ever a 
mainspring of his own life—namely, that it was always and
everywhere the duty of the more fortunate to help the less
fortunate.</p>
          <p>While he was sometimes severe with his more prosperous
and better educated associates he was always considerate
and thoughtful of the ignorant, the old, and the weak. He
was never too busy to delight the heart of a white-haired
old man who had been the original cook of the school by
listening to his stories about the early days, or to discuss
with another old man his experiences in the Civil War.
He would never betray the least impatience in listening
to these old men tell him the same story for the five 
hundredth time. Although the real usefulness of both these
old fellows had long passed he never showed them by word
or deed that he did not regard them as useful and valuable
members of his staff.</p>
          <pb id="washi144" n="144"/>
          <p>Another old character to whom he invariably showed
kindness and patience was a crack-brained old itinerant
preacher who kept up an endless stream of unintelligible pious
jargon. This old fellow would harangue the air for hours at a
time right outside the Principal's busy office, but he would
never allow him to be stopped or sent away and always sent
or gave him a small contribution at the conclusion of his
tirades, if indeed they could be said to have any conclusion.</p>
          <p>Booker Washington had a weakness for the picturesque
ne'er-do-wells of his race. One such old fellow, who lived 
near Tuskegee and who had always displayed great ingenuity in
extracting money from him, one day, when he was driving
down the main street of Tuskegee behind a pair of fast and
spirited horses, rushed out into the street and stopped him as
though he had a matter of the greatest urgency to impart to
him. When Mr. Washington had with difficulty reined in his
horses and asked him what he wanted the old man said
breathlessly, “I'se got a tirkey for yo' Thanksgivin'!”</p>
          <p>“How much does it weigh?” inquired Mr. Washington.</p>
          <p>“Twelve to fifteen poun'.”</p>
          <p>After thanking the old man warmly, Mr. Washington started
to drive on when the old fellow added, “I jest wants to 
borrow a dollar for to fatten yo' turkey for you!”</p>
          <p>With a laugh Mr. Washington handed the old man the dollar
and drove on. He never could be made to feel that by these
spontaneous generosities he was encouraging
<pb id="washi145" n="145"/>
thriftlessness and mendicancy. He was incorrigible in his
unscientific open-handedness with the poor, begging older
members of his race.</p>
          <p>At the time of the Tuskegee teachers' annual picnic, usually
held in May, many of these old darkies would attend uninvited
and armed with huge empty baskets. Mr. Washington always
greeted them like honored guests and allowed them to carry
off provisions enough to feed large families for days. He
would also introduce them to the officers and teachers of the
school and to any invited guests who might be present.</p>
          <p>Old man Harry Varner was the night watchman of the
school in its early days and a man upon whom Mr.
Washington very much depended. He lived in a cabin opposite
the school grounds. After hearing many talks about the
importance of living in a real house instead of a one or two
room cabin, old Uncle Harry finally decided that he must have
a real house. Accordingly he came to his employer, told him
his feeling in the matter, and laid before him his meagre
savings, which he had determined to spend for a real house.
Mr. Washington went with him to select the lot and added
enough out of his own pocket to the scant savings to enable
the old man to buy a cow and a pig and a garden plot as well
as the house. From then on for weeks he and old Uncle Harry
would have long and mysterious conferences over the planning
of that little four-room cottage. It is doubtful if Dr. 
Washington ever devoted more time or thought to planning any 
of the great buildings of the Institute. No potentate was 
ever half as 
<pb id="washi146" n="146"/>
proud of his palace as Uncle Harry of his four-room cottage
when it was finally finished and painted and stood forth in 
all its glory to be admired of all men. And Booker Washington
was scarcely less proud of it than Uncle Harry.</p>
          <p>With Uncle Harry Varner, Old Man Brannum, the original
cook of the school to whom reference has already been made,
and Lewis Adams of the town of Tuskegee, whom Mr.
Washington mentions in “Up from Slavery” as one of his chief
advisers, all unlettered-before-the-war Negroes, his
relationship was always particularly intimate. These three 
old men enjoyed the confidence of the white people of the 
town of Tuskegee to an unusual extent and often acted as
ambassadors of good-will between the head of the school and
his white neighbors when from time to time the latter showed
a disposition to look askance at the rapidly growing 
institution on the hill beyond the town.</p>
          <p>Another intimate friend of Mr. Washington's was Charles
L. Diggs, known affectionately on the school grounds as “Old
Man Diggs.” The old man had been body servant to a Union
officer in the Civil War and after the war had been carried 
to Boston, where he became the butler in a fashionable Back
Bay family. When Mr. Washington first visited Boston, as an
humble and obscure young Negro school teacher pleading for
his struggling school, he met Diggs, and Diggs succeeded in
interesting his employers in the sincere and earnest young
Negro teacher. When years afterward the Institute had
grown 
<pb id="washi147" n="147"/>
to the dignity of needing stewards, Mr. Washington 
employed his old friend as steward of the Teachers' Home.
In all the years thereafter hardly a day passed when Mr.
Washington was at the school without his having some
kind of powwow with Old Man Diggs regarding some
matter affecting the interests of the school.</p>
          <p>To the despair of his family Booker Washington seemed
to go out of his way to find forlorn old people whom he
could befriend. He sent provisions weekly to an humble
old black couple from whom he had bought a tract of
land for the school. He did the same for old Aunt Harriet
and her deaf, dumb, and lame son, except that to them he
provided fuel as well. On any particularly cold day he
would send one or more students over to Aunt Harriet's
to find out if she and her poor helpless son were 
comfortable. Also every Sunday afternoon, to the joy of this
pathetic couple, a particularly appetizing Sunday dinner
unfailingly made its appearance. And these were only
a few of the pensioners and semi-pensioners whom Booker
Washington accumulated as he went about his kindly
way.</p>
          <p>One means of keeping in touch with the masses of his
people which he never neglected was through attending
the annual National Negro Baptist Conventions. At
these great gatherings he came in touch with the religious
leaders of two million Negroes. Notwithstanding the
fact that he practically collapsed at the annual meeting of
the National Negro Business League held in Boston in
August, 1915, and had to be nursed for some weeks 
<pb id="washi148" n="148"/>
following before he was even strong enough to return to
Tuskegee, he insisted in spite of the admonitions of 
physicians and the pleadings of friends, family, and 
colleagues, in keeping his engagement to speak before this 
great convention in Chicago in September. To all protests 
he replied, “It would do me more harm to stay away than to 
go.” With these words, and rallying the rapidly waning 
dregs of his once great strength he went and made an 
address which ranks with the most powerful he ever 
delivered to his people. A threatened split in the Baptist 
denomination in part accounted for his insistence upon 
attending this convention. In this address, delivered only
two months before he died of sheer exhaustion, and the last 
he made before any great body of his own people, he said in 
part:</p>
          <p>“My only excuse for accepting your invitation to appear
before you in these annual gatherings is that I am deeply
interested in all that this National Baptist Convention 
stands for. It is in my opinion the largest and most 
representative body of colored people anywhere in the world.
 . . . I believe most profoundly in the work of this 
convention because it represents the common masses of all 
our people, those who are the foundation of our success as 
a race. I believe in you because you do not pretend to 
represent the classes but the masses of our people. I am 
here, too, because the Baptist Church among our people 
throughout the country is affording them an opportunity to 
get lessons in self-government in a degree that is true of 
few other organizations.</p>
          <pb id="washi149" n="149"/>
          <p>“You who control this great convention have before
you a great opportunity and along with this opportunity
a tremendous responsibility. It is given to you, as to all
men, to pursue one of two courses, and that is, to be big
leaders or little leaders. You can construct or you can
destroy. The time is now at hand when in each individual
church organization and each district association and each
State convention and in this great national convention, the
little man must give way and let the big, broad, generous
man take his place. Nothing is ever gained in business,
in education, or in religious work by being little, narrow, 
or jealous in our sympathies and activities.”</p>
          <p>Two days later, after he had left the convention and 
returned home, Mr. Washington received word that the
convention had split, contending leaders holding out for
what they termed principles. Immediately on the receipt
of this report he dispatched the following telegram to the
leaders of the two opposing factions:</p>
          <q type="letter" direct="unspecified">
            <text>
              <body>
                <div1 type="letter">
                  <p>I earnestly beg and urge that each convention remain
in session until all differences are composed. In the
event this cannot be done I hope each convention will
empower a small committee or authorize some one to
appoint committees that may have power in settling present 
difficulties so that next year there may be but one 
convention. It is easier now to bring about reconciliation
than it will be later. It will be a calamity to the Baptist
Church and to our race for the present split to continue.
It will soon spread to all the Baptist churches in all the
States. I would urge that each side manifest a broad
<pb id="washi150" n="150"/>
liberal spirit and be willing to sacrifice something for the
good of the cause. Millions of our humble people throughout 
the country are depending upon our leaders to settle
their difficulties in a Christian spirit and they should not
be disappointed. If I may be used at any time in any
way my services are at your command. Have sent a
similar telegram to Dr.——.</p>
                  <closer>

                </div1>
              </body>
            </text>
          </q>
          <p>Unhappily he did not have the satisfaction of bringing
the two factions together before he died, but until the last
he continued his efforts in this direction.</p>
          <p>Largely because of his intimate knowledge of the plain
people Booker Washington appealed to the great of the
earth. In his books, “Up from Slavery,” “The Story of
My Life and Work,” and “My Larger Education,” he
tells of taking tea with Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle,
of his association with Presidents McKinley, Roosevelt,
and Taft, of his introduction to Prince Henry of Prussia,
of his dining with the King and Queen of Denmark, and
of his long friendships with William H. Baldwin, Jr.,
Robert C. Ogden, Henry H. Rogers, John D. Rockefeller,
and Andrew Carnegie. He was of value and interest
to such people largely because of his closeness to his own
people. His power to interest such people was largely
because he was so close to the rank and file of his own
people.</p>
          <p>After the death of Henry H. Rogers, Mr. Washington
said of him in an interview published at the time in the
New York <hi rend="italics">Evening Post:</hi> “The more experiences I have of
<pb id="washi151" n="151"/>
the world, the more I am convinced that the only proper
and the only safe way to judge any one is at first hand and
by your actual experience. It seems to me that, outside
of the immediate members of my family, I knew the late
Henry H. Rogers during the last fifteen years as well as I
could know any one. Of all the men that I have ever
known intimately, no matter what their station in life,
Mr. Rogers always impressed me as being among the kindest 
and gentlest. That was the impression he made upon
me the first time I ever met him, and during the fifteen
years that I knew him that impression was deepened every
time I met him.” (And this was Booker Washington's
impression of the second greatest figure in the building
up of the huge, world-powerful corporation whose methods 
during its period of rapid expansion had at that time
been only recently described in <hi rend="italics">McClure's Magazine</hi> by
Ida M. Tarbell.) “I am sure that the members of his
family will forgive me for telling, now that he has laid
down his great work and gone to rest, some things about
him which I feel that the public should know but which
he always forbade me to mention while he lived.</p>
          <p>“The first time I ever met Mr. Rogers was in this
manner: about fifteen years ago a large meeting was held
in Madison Square Garden concert hall, to obtain funds
for the Tuskegee Institute. Mr. Rogers attended the
meeting, but came so late that, as the auditorium was
crowded, he could not get a seat. He stood in the
back part of the hall, however, and listened to the
speaking.</p>
          <pb id="washi152" n="152"/>
          <p>“The next morning I received a telegram from him asking 
me to call at his office. When I entered he remarked
that he had been present at the meeting the night previous,
and expected the ‘hat to be passed,’ but as that was not
done he wanted to ‘chip in’ something. Thereupon he
handed me ten one-thousand-dollar bills for the Tuskegee
Institute. In doing this he imposed only one condition,
that the gift should be mentioned to no one. Later on,
however, when I told him that I did not care to take so
large a sum of money without some one knowing it, he 
consented that I tell one or two of our Trustees about the
source of the gift. I cannot now recall the number of
times that he has helped us, but in doing so he always 
insisted that his name be never used. He seemed to enjoy
making gifts in currency.”</p>
          <p>In an article published in <hi rend="italics">McClure's Magazine</hi> in May,
1902, Rear-Admiral Robley D. Evans thus describes the
occasion on which he presented Booker Washington to
Prince Henry of Prussia: “The first request made by
Prince Henry, after being received in New York, was that
I should arrange to give him some of the old Southern
melodies, if possible, sung by Negroes; that he was 
passionately fond of them, and had been all his life—not 
the ragtime songs, but the old Negro melodies. Several times
during his trip I endeavored to carry out his wishes, with
more or less success; but finally, at the Waldorf-Astoria,
the Hampton singers presented themselves in one of the
reception rooms and gave him a recital of Indian and Negro
melodies. He was charmed. And while I was talking to
<pb id="washi153" n="153"/>
him, just after a Sioux Indian had sung a lullaby, he 
suddenly turned and said: ‘Isn't that Booker T. Washington
over there?’ I recognized Washington and replied that it
was, and he said: ‘Evans, would you mind presenting him
to me? I know how some of your people feel about 
Washington, but I have always had great sympathy with the
African race, and I want to meet the man I regard as the
leader of that race.’ So I went at once to Washington and
told him that the Prince wished him to be presented, and
took him, myself, and presented him to the Prince.
Booker Washington sat down and talked with him for fully
ten minutes, and it was a most interesting conversation,
one of the most interesting I ever heard in my life. The
ease with which Washington conducted himself was very
striking, and I only accounted for it afterward when I 
remembered that he had dined with the Queen of England
two or three times, so that this was not a new thing for him.
Indeed, Booker Washington's manner was easier than that
of almost any other man I saw meet the Prince in this
country. The Prince afterward referred to President
Roosevelt's action in regard to Booker Washington, and
applauded it very highly.”</p>
          <p>In 1911 Mr. Washington visited Denmark with the 
particular purpose of observing the world-famed agricultural
methods of that country. While in Copenhagen he was
presented to the King and Queen. This experience he 
described on his return to this country in an article 
published in the New York <hi rend="italics">Age</hi>, the well-known Negro paper, 
in December of the same year. The portion of the article 
<pb id="washi154" n="154"/>
describing his meeting with the King and Queen reads as 
follows:</p>
          <lb/>
          <p>“Soon after I entered, the Chamberlain went in and
presently returned to tell me the King would be ready to
see me in about five minutes. At the end of the five 
minutes exactly the door was opened and I found myself in the
King's chamber. I had expected to see a gorgeously
fitted apartment, something to compare with what I had
seen elsewhere in the palace. Imagine my surprise when I
found practically nothing in the room except the King,
himself. There was not a chair, a sofa, or, so far as I can
recall, a single thing in the way of furniture—nothing 
except the King and his sword. I was surprised again, 
considering the formality by which he was surrounded, by the
familiar and kindly manner in which the King received me,
and by his excellent English. Both of us remained standing 
during the whole interview, which must have lasted
twenty minutes. I say we remained standing, because,
even had etiquette permitted it we could not have done
anything else because there was nothing in the room for
either of us to sit upon.</p>
          <p>“I had been warned by the American Minister and Mr.
Cavling, however, as to what might be the result of this
interview. Among other things in regard to which I had
been carefully instructed by the American Minister was I
must never turn my back upon the King, that I must not
lead off in any conversation, that I must let the King 
suggest the subjects to be discussed, and not take the 
initiative in raising any question for discussion. I tried 
to follow Minister Egan's instructions in this regard as 
well as I could, but I fear I was not wholly successful.</p>
          <p>“I had not been talking with the King many minutes 
<pb id="washi155" n="155"/>
before I found that he was perfectly familiar with the work 
of the Tuskegee school, that he had read much that I had 
written, and was well acquainted with all that I was trying 
to do for the Negroes in the South. He referred to the fact 
that Denmark was interested in the colored people in their own
colony in the Danish West Indies, and that both he and the
Queen were anxious that something be done for the colored
people in the Danish possessions similar to what we were
doing at Tuskegee. He added that he hoped at some time
I would find it possible to visit the Danish West Indian
Islands.</p>
          <p>“As I have said, I had been warned as to what might be
the result of this visit to the King and that I had best be
careful how I made my plans for the evening. As the
interview was closing, the King took me by the hand and
said, ‘The Queen would be pleased to have you dine
at the palace to-night,’ at the same time naming the
hour.</p>
          <p>“The Minister had told me that this was his way of
commanding persons to dine, and that an invitation given
must be obeyed. Of course I was delighted to accept the
invitation, though I feared it would wreck my plans for
seeing the country people. The King was so kind and put
me so at my ease in his presence that I fear I forgot 
Minister Eagan's warning not to turn my back upon him, and I
must confess that I got out of the room in about the same
way I usually go out of the room when I have had an
audience with President Taft.</p>
          <p>“Leaving the King and the palace, I found out on the
street quite a group of newspaper people, most of them 
representing American papers, who were very anxious to
know, in the usual American fashion, just what took place
during the interview, how long I was with the King, what
we talked about, and what not. They were especially
<pb id="washi156" n="156"/>
anxious to know if I had been invited to the palace for
dinner.”</p>
          <lb/>
          <p>And further on he thus describes the dinner:</p>
          <lb/>
          <p>“The dinner was not at the palace where I was received
in the morning, but at the summer palace several miles out
of Copenhagen. When I reached the hotel from the
country it soon dawned upon me that I was in great
danger of being late. To keep a King and Queen and
their guests waiting on one for dinner would of course be an
outrageous offense. I dressed as hastily as I was able, but
just as I was putting on the finishing touches to my 
costume my white tie bursted. I was in a predicament from
which for a moment I saw no means of rescuing myself.
I did not have time to get another tie, and of course I could
not wear the black one. As well as I could, however, I put
the white tie about my neck, fastened it with a pin, and
earnestly prayed that it might remain in decent position
until the dinner was over. Nevertheless, I trembled all
through the dinner for fear that my tie might go back on
me.</p>
          <p>“I succeeded in reaching the summer palace about ten
minutes before the time to go into the dining-room. Here
again I was met by the King's Chamberlain by whom I
was conveyed through a series of rooms and, finally, into
the presence of the King, who, after some conversation,
led me where the Queen was standing and presented me to
her. The Queen received me graciously and even cordially.
She spoke English perfectly, and seemed perfectly familiar
with my work. I had, however, a sneaking idea that 
Minister Egan was responsible for a good deal of the 
familiarity which both the King and Queen seemed to exhibit 
regarding Tuskegee.</p>
          <pb id="washi157" n="157"/>
          <p>“As I entered the reception-room there were about twenty
or twenty-five people who were to be entertained at dinner. I
will not attempt to describe the elegance, not to say 
splendor, of everything in connection with the dinner. As I 
ate food for the first time in my life out of gold dishes, 
I could not but recall the time when as a slave boy I ate 
my syrup from a tin plate.</p>
          <p>“I think I got through the dinner pretty well by following my
usual custom, namely, of watching other people to see just
what they did and what they did not do. There was one place,
however, where I confess I made a failure. It is customary at
the King's table, as is true at other functions in many 
portions of Europe, I understand, to drink a silent toast 
to the King. This was so new and strange to me that I 
decided that, since I did not understand the custom, the 
best thing was to frankly confess my ignorance. I reassured 
myself with the reflection that people will easier pardon 
ignorance than pretense.</p>
          <p>“At a certain point during the dinner each guest is expected,
it seems, to get the eye of the King and then rise and drink 
to the health of the King. When he rises he makes a bow to the
King and the King returns the bow. Nothing is said by either
the King or the guest. I think practically all the invited 
guests except myself went through this performance. It seemed 
to me a very fitting way of expressing respect for the King, 
as the head of a nation and as a man, and now that I know
something about it, I think if I had another chance I could 
do myself credit in that regard.</p>
          <p>“During the dinner I had the privilege of meeting a very
interesting old gentleman, now some eighty years of age, the
uncle of the King, Prince——, who spoke good English. I 
had a very interesting conversation with him,
<pb id="washi158" n="158"/>
and since returning to America I have had some 
correspondence with him.</p>
          <p>“As I have already said, the Queen Mother of England was at
this time in Copenhagen, and as I afterward learned, her 
sister, the Queen Mother of Russia, was also there. As both 
of these were in mourning on account of the recent death of 
King Edward, they did not appear at this dinner. I was 
reminded of their presence, however, when as I was leaving 
the King's palace after my interview in the morning, one of 
the marshals presented me with two autograph books, with the 
request that I inscribe my name in them. One of the books, 
as I afterward learned, belonged to the Queen Mother of 
England; the other belonged to the Queen Mother of <sic corr="Russia.&quot;">Russia.</sic></p>
          <lb/>
          <p>A mere catalogue of the principal organizations which
Booker T. Washington founded for the purpose of helping his
people to help themselves tells a story of constructive
achievement more impressive than any amount of abstract
eulogy.</p>
          <p>The following is a list of such organizations given in
chronological order with a few words of description for the
purpose of identifying each:</p>
          <p>In 1884 he founded the Teachers' Institute, consisting of
summer courses, conferences, and exhibits having as their 
main purpose the extension of the advantages of Tuskegee 
Institute to the country school teachers of the surrounding 
country. The work of this Institute is described in the 
chapter: “Washington, the Educator.”</p>
          <p>In 1891 he established the Annual Tuskegee Negro
Conference. He decided that the school should not only help 
<pb id="washi159" n="159"/>
directly its own students, but should reach out and help the
students' parents and the older people generally in the
country districts of the State. He started by inviting the
farmers and their wives in the immediate locality to spend
a day at the school for the frank discussion of their 
material and spiritual condition to the end that the school
might learn how it could best help them to help themselves.
From this simple beginning the Conference has grown until
it now consists of delegates from every Southern State, 
besides hundreds of teachers and principals of Negro schools,
Northern men and women, publicists and philanthropists,
newspaper and magazine writers, Southern white men and
Southern white women, all interested in helping the simple
black folk in their strivings to “quit libin' in de ashes,” 
as one of them fervently expressed it. At one of these 
conferences an old preacher from a country district concluded
an earnest prayer for the deliverance of his people from the
bondage of ignorance with this startling sentence: “And
now, O Lord, put dy foot down in our hearts and lif' us
up!”</p>
          <p>The year following Mr. Washington established a 
hospital in Greenwood village, the hamlet adjoining the 
Institute grounds where live most of the teachers, officers, 
and employees. It was at first hardly more than a dispensary,
but when the Institute acquired a Resident Physician two
small buildings were set aside as hospitals for men and
women, respectively. Later a five-thousand-dollar building 
was given which served as the hospital until, in 1913,
Mrs. Elizabeth A. Mason, of Boston, presented Tuskegee
<pb id="washi160" n="160"/>
with a fifty-thousand-dollar splendidly equipped modern
hospital, in memory of her grandfather, John A. Andrew, the
War Governor of Massachusetts. While these hospitals, from
the first humble dispensary to the fine hospital of to-day, 
were of course primarily for the Institute they were in true
Tuskegee fashion thrown open to all who needed them. And
since the town of Tuskegee has no hospital they have always
been freely used by outside colored people. Mr. Washington,
himself, on his riding and hunting trips would from time to 
time find sick people whom he would have brought to the 
hospital for care.</p>
          <p>The next year, 1893, he started the Minister's Night School.
This is conducted by the Phelps Hall Bible Training School of
the Institute. Here country ministers with large families and
small means are given night courses in all the subjects likely
to be of service to them from “Biblical criticism” to the
“planting and cultivating of crops.”</p>
          <p>The year following Mrs. Washington began the Tuskegee
Town Mothers' Meetings. Both she and Mr. Washington had
long been distressed at seeing the women and young girls
loafing about the streets of the town of Tuskegee when they
came to town with their husbands and fathers on Saturday
afternoons. Now, instead of loafing about the streets these
women attend the Mothers' Meetings where Mrs. Washington
and the various women teachers give them practical talks on
all manner of housekeeping and family-raising problems from
the making of preserves to proper parental care.
<pb id="washi161" n="161"/>
In 1895 the Building and Loan Association was established.
The Institute's chief accountant is its president, and the
Institute's treasurer its secretary and treasurer. This
Association has enabled many scores of people to secure their
own homes who without its aid could not have done so.</p>
          <p>The next year the Town Night School was started. This
school has as its purpose giving instruction to the boys and
girls who have positions in the town which make it impossible
for them to attend the Institute, and to the servants in the
white families. This school has become one of the best and
strongest forces in the life of the community. As an outgrowth
of it came later the Town Library and Reading Room, for
which Mr. Washington personally provided the room. There is
now in this school a cooking class for girls and several
industrial classes for boys. At the same time Mr. Washington
established a Farmers' Institute which is described in the
chapter “Washington and the Negro Farmer.”</p>
          <p>In 1898 he started a County Fair to spur the ambition of the
Negro farmers of the county. This Negro County Fair under
his guidance grew and flourished from year to year. The
whites maintained a separate County Fair. Finally, the two 
fairs were combined, and now one of the most flourishing 
County Fairs in all the South is conducted, both races 
supporting it by making exhibits, and sharing in the success 
and profits of the enterprise, as well as in its general 
management.</p>
          <p>In 1900 he organized the National Negro Business 
<pb id="washi162" n="162"/>
League, as described in the chapter, “Washington and the
Negro Business Man.”</p>
          <p>Two years later he established the Greenwood Village
Improvement Association for the little community which
has grown up around the school. Taxes are collected from
the property holders as well as the renters for the upkeep
of the roads, bridges, and fences, and a park in the centre 
of the village, which was introduced in emulation of the
typical New England village. Just as in New England,
also, this central park, or “green,” is surrounded by a 
number of churches. An elective Board of Control presides
over this village, settles disputes, and keeps the community
in good repair morally and spiritually, as well as physically.
On the Monday immediately following the close of a regular 
school term a town meeting is held at which reports are
read and discussed covering every phase of the life of the
community. Mr. Washington particularly enjoyed 
presiding at these meetings because they demonstrated what
the people of his race could accomplish under a favorable
and stimulating environment. He always contrived to
have the meetings followed by simple refreshments and a
social hour.</p>
          <p>In 1904 he started the Rural School Improvement 
Campaign and the Farmers' Short Course at the Institute, both
of which are described in the chapter, “Washington, the
Educator.” In the same year he started a systematic
effort to improve the conditions in the jails and the chain
gangs and for the rehabilitation of released prisoners.</p>
          <p>The next year he founded a weekly farm paper, a 
<pb id="washi163" n="163"/>
circulating library, and a Ministers' Institute. The year 
after, 1906, the Jesup Agricultural Wagon—the 
agricultural school on wheels, which is described in the 
chapter, “Washington, the Educator”—was started. In 1907 
the farmers' coöperative demonstration work, which has also 
been mentioned, was inaugurated. In 1910 the rural 
improvement speaking tours began. And finally, in 1914, he 
established “Baldwin Farms,” the farming community for the 
graduates of the agricultural department of Tuskegee, which 
also has been previously described.</p>
          <p>These, then, are some of the tangible means which Booker
Washington developed during a period of thirty years for
keeping in touch with his people and for keeping his people 
in touch with one another and with all the things which go 
to make up wholesome and useful living.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER SEVEN</head>
          <head>BOOKER WASHINGTON AND THE NEGRO FARMER</head>
          <p>BOOKER T. WASHINGTON was a great believer in the
experience meeting, and the Tuskegee Negro Conference,
which he started in 1891, is nothing more nor less than an
agricultural experience meeting. He placed his faith in the
persuasive power of example—in the contagion of successful
achievement. He once said: “One farm bought, one house 
built, one home sweetly and intelligently kept, one man who
is the largest taxpayer or has the largest bank account, one
school or church maintained, one factory running successfully,
one truck garden profitably cultivated, one patient
cured by a Negro doctor, one sermon well preached, one
office well filled, one life cleanly lived—these will 
tell more in our favor than all the abstract eloquence that 
can be summoned to plead our cause. Our pathway must be up
through the soil, up through swamps, up through forests,
up through the streams, the rocks, up through commerce,
education, and religion.”</p>
          <p>Nothing delighted Mr. Washington more than the 
successful Negro farmers who had started in life without
money, friends, influence, or education—with literally
nothing but their hands. At one of the Tuskegee conferences
<pb id="washi165" n="165"/>
not many years ago his keen eyes spotted such a
man in the audience and he called to him in his straight
from the shoulder manner: “Get up and tell us what you
have been doing as a farmer.”</p>
          <p>A tall, finely built, elderly man, looking almost like a
Nubian giant, arose in his place, his face wreathed in
smiles, and showing his white teeth as he spoke: “Doctor,
I done 'tended one o' yore conferences here 'bout ten year
ago. I heard you say dat a man ain't wurth nuthin' as
a man or a citizen 'less he owns his home, 'least one mule,
and has a bank account, an' so I made up my mind dat
warn't wuth nuthin', an' so I went home an' talked de
whole matter over wid de ol' woman. We decided dat we
would make a start, an' now I's proud to tell you dat I's
not only got a bank account, but I's got two bank 
accounts, an' heah's de bank books (proudly holding on
high two grimy bank books); I also own two hun'ed acres
of land an' all de land is paid for. I also own two mules,
an' bofe dem mules is paid for. I also own some other
property, an' de ole woman an' me an' de chilluns lives in
a good house an' de house is paid for. All dis come 'bout
from my comin' to dis heah conference.”</p>
          <p>Another old fellow, when called upon to tell what he
had accomplished, dexterously evaded the direct inquiry
for some minutes, and when Mr. Washington finally 
succeeded in pinning him down, said: “All I's got to say,
Doctah Washington, is dat dis heah conference dun woke
me up an' I'll be back heah next year wid a report gist
like dese oder fellers.</p>
          <pb id="washi166" n="166"/>
          <p>Mr. Washington was a great believer in his favorite
animal, the pig, as a mortgage lifter and general aid to
prosperity. At one of the conferences, after he had paid
a particularly warm eulogy to the economic importance
of the pig, an old woman got up and said: “Mr. 
Washington, you is got befo' you now Sister Nelson of 
Tallapoosa County, Alabama. All I has I owes to dis 
conference and one little puppy dog.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Washington challenged: “How's that?”</p>
          <p>The old woman continued: “I got a little pig from dat
little puppy dog an' I got my prosperity from dat pig!”</p>
          <p>Mr. Washington and the whole company in amazement
hung upon the old woman's words as she continued: “It
was dis way: Dat little puppy dog when she growed up
had some little puppies herself. One day one o' my fren's
come by an' as' me for one o' dem puppies. I tol' him
‘No,’ I would not gib him dat puppy, but dat he had a
little pig an' I would 'change a puppy for a pig. I had
heard you tell ober heah so much 'bout hogs an' pigs dat
I thought dis was a good chance to get started. He give
me de pig an' I give him de puppy. In de course o' time
dat little pig dun bring me in some mo' pigs. I sol' some
an' kep' some. I had to feed de pig, so I had begun savin'.
I den begun to find out dat I could git on wid less den I
had ben gettin' on wid, an' so I kep' on savin' an' kep' on
raisin' pigs 'til I was able to supply most o' my neighbors
wid pigs, an' den I got me a cow, an den I begun to supply
my neighbors wid milk, an' den I started me a little garden.
Den I sol' my neighbors greens an' onions, an' so I went
<pb id="washi167" n="167"/>
on fum time to time 'til I dun paid for de lot an' de house
in which I lib, an' I keeps my pigs about me an' keeps
my garden goin', an' dat's why I says all I is I owes to dat
little puppy dog an' to dis heah conference.”</p>
          <p>At these conferences the most elementary subjects are
discussed. Booker Washington would tell and have told
to these farmers matters which one would naturally assume
any farmers, however ignorant, must already know. He
never tried to deceive himself as to the woful ignorance
of the Negro masses, and still he was never discouraged,
but always said ignorance was not a hopeless handicap
because it could be overcome by education. While he
frankly although sadly acknowledged the lamentable 
ignorance of the rank and file of his race, particularly those
on the soil and dependent for education upon the short-term,
ill-equipped, and poorly taught rural Negro school, he as
stoutly denied and constantly disproved the assertion that
these ignorant masses were not capable of profiting by
education. He earnestly strove and signally succeeded in
attracting to these great annual agricultural conferences
the most pathetically ignorant of the Negro farmers as well 
as the leading scientific agriculturists of the race. But
he always insisted that the meetings be conducted for the
benefit of the ignorant and not in the interests of the
learned.</p>
          <p>He would, for instance, tell the attendants at the 
conferences what to plant and when to plant it, and what live
stock to keep and how to keep it. He would have printed
and distributed among them a “Farmer's Calendar”
<pb id="washi168" n="168"/>
which gave the months in which the various standard
vegetables should be planted and what crops should be
used in rotation. He constantly insisted that the 
Experiment Station at Tuskegee Institute, supported by the
State of Alabama, should not be used for scientific 
experiments of interest only to experts, but should deal with
the fundamental problems with which the Negro farmers
of Alabama were daily confronted. The titles of some of
the Experiment Station Bulletins selected at random 
suggest the homely and practical nature of the information
disseminated. Half a dozen of them read as follows:
“Possibilities of the Sweet Potato in Macon County,
Alabama,” “How to Grow the Peanut and 105 Ways of
Preparing It for Human Consumption,” “How to Raise
Pigs with Little Money,” “When, What, and How to
Can and Preserve Fruits and Vegetables in the Home,”
“Some Possibilities of the Cowpea in Macon County,
Alabama,” “A New and Prolific Variety of Cotton.” And
all of these bulletins, so many of which deal with the 
problems of the home, are written by an old bachelor of pure
African descent, without a drop of white blood, who in
himself refutes two popular fallacies: the one that 
bachelors cannot be skilled in domestic affairs, and the 
other, that pure-blooded Africans cannot achieve intellectual
distinction. This man is George W. Carver, who is not
only the most eminent agricultural scientist of his race in
this country, but one of the most eminent of any race.
His work is so well known in scientific circles in his field
throughout the world that when leading European scientists
<pb id="washi169" n="169"/>
visit this country, particularly the Southern States, they 
not infrequently go out of their way to look him up. They 
are usually very much surprised to find their eminent 
fellow-scientist a black man.</p>
          <p>The last of these conferences over which Booker
Washington presided was held at Tuskegee, January 20 and
21, 1915. A woman, the wife of a Negro farmer, was testifying
when she said: “Our menfolks is foun' out dat they can't eat
cotton.” As the outburst of laughter which greeted this 
remark died down, Mr. Washington said in his incisive way: 
“What do you mean?” The woman replied: “I mean dat we 
womenfolks been tellin' our menfolks all de time dat they 
should raise mo to eat.”</p>
          <p>She then displayed specimens of canned fruits and told how
she had put up enough of them to supply her family until
summer. She told of having sold thirty-six turkeys and of
selling two and three dozen eggs each week, with plenty left
over for her family. She said that she and her husband had
raised and sold hogs, and still had for their own use more 
than enough pork to last them until the next hog-killing time.</p>
          <p>“How often do you eat chicken?” asked Dr. Washington.</p>
          <p>“We can eat chicken every day if we want it,” she replied.</p>
          <p>When she had finished Mr. Washington explained that all
this had been done on 178 acres of the poorest land in Macon
County.</p>
          <p>In his opening address at this conference Mr. Washington
denounced “petty thieving, pistol-toting, 
<pb id="washi170" n="170"/>
crap-shooting, the patronizing of ‘blind tigers,’ and 
unnecessary lawsuits” as some of the weights and encumbrances
which are keeping the Negro from running well the race
which is set before him.</p>
          <p>These are some of the basic questions which Booker
Washington placed before the conference for discussion:</p>
          <p>“How and why am I so hard hit by the present hard
times?”</p>
          <p>“What am I doing to meet present conditions?”</p>
          <p>“How may I, after all, get some real benefit from present
difficulties?”</p>
          <p>The most spectacular feature of the exercises was the
parade. It extended for almost a mile and included a
score or more of floats, hundreds of men and women in
appropriate costumes, and dozens of horses, mules, and
other live stock.</p>
          <p>There were a large number of colored preachers in
attendance who showed that they had adopted the 
Washington slogan of trying to make a heaven on earth and
whose testimony showed that they were now giving as
much time to soil salvation as to soul salvation. One
of them told of a flourishing Pig Club which he had organized
among his parishioners after reading Mr. Washington's open 
letter, “Pigs and Education; Pigs and Debts,”
the circulating of which will be later described.</p>
          <p>After the awarding of prizes for the best floats the
declarations of the conference were read by Major R. R.
Moton of Hampton Institute, who then little realized
that before the year was out he was to be chosen to 
<figure id="ill9" entity="wash170"><p>This old woman was a regular attendant at the
Tuskegee Negro Conference and idolizingly watched Mr. Washington during the whole four hours that he would preside over one of the Conference sessions</p></figure>
<pb id="washi171" n="171"/>
succeed the leader of his race as the Principal of Tuskegee
Institute.</p>
          <p>The following were the especially significant paragraphs of
these declarations:</p>
          <p>“It is found that for every dollar's worth of cotton we grow,
we raise only forty-nine cents' worth of all other crops. An
investigation has shown that there are 20,000 farms of
Negroes on which there are no cattle of any kind; 270,000 on
which there are no hogs; 200,000 on which no poultry is 
raised; 140,000 on which no corn is grown; on 750,000 farms 
of Negroes no oats are grown; on 550,000 farms no sweet
potatoes are grown, and on 200,000 farms of Negroes there
are no gardens of any sort. These hundreds of thousands of
farms without cattle, grain, or gardens are for the most part
operated by tenants. In their behalf, the Tuskegee Negro
Conference respectfully requests of the planters, bankers, 
and other representatives of the financial interests of the 
South that more opportunities be given Negro tenants on 
plantations to grow crops other than cotton.”</p>
          <p>After the regular conference the usual Conference of
Workers was held. This conference is composed of people
such as heads of schools and colleges, preachers, teachers,
and persons generally holding responsible positions of
leadership in their respective communities. These leaders
discuss the larger community problems in distinction from
individual problems. At this gathering, for instance, the
principal of the County High School at Cottage Grove, Ala.,
explained how through diversified farming the
<pb id="washi172" n="172"/>
parents of his students had been able to live while holding
their cotton for higher prices.</p>
          <p>Some of the principals of schools told how they had
accepted cotton as payment of tuition for some of their
students. Others had taken in payment barrels of syrup, sacks
of corn, and hogs. All the schools reported cutting expenses,
by reduction of their dietary, the salaries of teachers, or 
some other forms of retrenchment, meaning sacrifice for 
students or teachers, or both, that the work of education 
might continue and weather the hard times. In concluding 
the conference Booker Washington explained the terms of the 
recently enacted Smith Lever Act for Federal aid in the 
extension of agricultural education throughout the rural 
districts of the country. Thus ended the twentieth session 
of the great Tuskegee Negro Conference and the last session 
presided over by the Founder of the Conference. It was most
appropriate that this, his last conference, should have so
unanimously and effectively applied one of the leading tenets
of Booker Washington's teaching—namely, the winning of
lasting profit from the experiences of adversity.</p>
          <p>As well as these annual Farmers' Conferences there are
held at Tuskegee monthly meetings for the farmers from the
locality where they display their products, tell of their
successes and failures, and compare notes on their
experiences all under the expert leadership, guidance, and
advice of the staff of the agricultural department of the
Institute. Every month, or oftener, there is an agricultural
exhibit in which the best products of the various crops such 
as potatoes,
<pb id="washi173" n="173"/>
corn, and cotton are displayed, and the methods used in their
production explained by figures and graphic charts.</p>
          <p>As early as 1895 Booker Washington started a campaign to
get his people to raise more pigs. This campaign he revived 
at intervals, and for the last time in the fall of 1914, when 
the whole country and particularly the South was suffering 
from the first acute depression caused by the European War. 
In the Southern States this depression was, of course, 
especially acute because the European market for cotton was 
for the time being cut off. As one of the means to aid his 
people in this trying time he sent the following letter to 
the entire press of the South of both races:</p>
          <q type="letter" direct="unspecified">
            <text>
              <body>

                  <p>Our race is in constant search of means with which to
provide better homes, schools, colleges, and churches, and 
with which to pay debts. This is especially true during the 
hard financial conditions obtaining on account of the 
European War. All of this cannot be done at once, but great 
progress can be made by a good strong pull together in a 
simple, direct manner. How?</p>
                  <p>There are 1,400,000 colored families who live on farms or in
villages, or small towns. Of this number, at the present time,
700,000 have no pigs. I want to ask that each family raise at
least one pig this fall. Where one or more pigs are already
owned, I want to ask that each family raise one additional pig
this fall.</p>
                  <p>As soon as possible, I want to ask that this plan be followed
by the organization of a Pig Club in every 
<pb id="washi174" n="174"/>
community where one does not already exist. I want to
ask that the matter be taken up at once through families,
schools, churches, and societies, Farmers' Institutes, 
Business Leagues, etc.</p>
                  <p>The average pig is valued at about $5. If each family
adds only one pig, in a few months at the present price for
hogs, $10 would be added to the wealth of the owner, and
$14,000 to the wealth of the colored people. If each
family adds two pigs, it would have in a few months $20
more wealth, and $28,000 would be added with which to
promote the welfare of the race during the money 
stringency created by the European War.</p>
                  <p>Let us not put it off, but organize Pig Clubs everywhere.
Give each boy and girl an opportunity to own and grow
at least one pig.</p>

          <p>This letter was not only printed by most of the white
papers as well as all of the Negro papers, but it was widely
endorsed editorially in the white as well as the black press.
Many of the newspapers for whites urged that the white
farmers also follow the suggestion. The granges and
farmers' institutes of both races took up the appeal and
urged it upon their members. There can be no doubt that
through the publication of this one brief letter, sent out at
just the right psychological moment, Booker Washington
materially aided the Southern farmers of both races to
tide over a serious crisis and materially increased the
economic wealth of the entire South. As he well knew, the
people were desperate and panicky and hence ready to
<pb id="washi175" n="175"/>
follow almost any lead. In any ordinary state of the
public mind such a letter could have produced nothing
like such an influence. This well illustrated Booker
Washington's accurate knowledge of and feeling for the
psychology of the public which enabled him almost 
without exception to speak or remain silent at the right
times.</p>
          <p>Booker Washington was not only interested in black
farmers but white farmers. He always emphasized the
responsibility of the farmer as the builder of the 
foundations of society. He was constantly inviting the white
farmers of the surrounding country to visit the school and
see what was being done on the school farms and by the
Experiment Station. And the white farmers availed
themselves freely of this opportunity and profited by it.
The school's veterinarian is probably the only one in the
county, and this division was established very largely for
the purpose of bringing the school and the community—
both white and black—into closer relation. In dealing
with farmers, even more perhaps than with other classes of
people, Washington would appeal to their pride and even
to their vanity. He was fond of telling them that they
were the salt of the earth. One of his favorite stories
was about the farmer who keeps his best potatoes for 
himself and his family and sends the speckled ones to town;
keeps his tender young chickens and sends the old tough
ones to town; keeps his rich milk and sends his skimmed
milk to town. While there may never have been quite
such a farmer the story had its element of truth, and
<pb id="washi176" n="176"/>
helped to make the farmer appreciate his good fortune and his
importance in the scheme of things.</p>
          <p>In 1910, when the last Federal Census was taken, 503 Negro
farm owners in Macon County, Booker Washington's home
county, owned 61,689 acres, or an average of more than one
hundred and twenty-two and one-half acres of land per man.
This is probably the largest amount of land owned by the
Negroes of any county in the United States. Certainly this 
was true at that time. The better class of Negro farmers has 
greatly increased during the past thirty years until at 
present from 90 to 95 per cent. of the 3,800 Negro farmers 
in the county operate their own farms either as cash tenants 
or owners. The increase in the number of Negroes owning or 
operating farms has been an important factor in securing a 
better quality and variety of food. They have diversified 
their crops and raised a larger amount of their own food 
supplies, particularly meat and vegetables, and they have 
produced more milk, butter, and eggs. It will be seen that 
Booker Washington's voice when he reiterated over and over 
again, “The man who owns the land will own much else 
besides,” did not fall upon deaf ears.</p>
          <p>When Booker Washington came to Macon County and founded 
Tuskegee Institute, in 1881, the soil was worn out, and
cotton, the chief crop, was selling for an almost constantly
lowering price. Although there were few counties with a
lower yield of cotton per acre, one-quarter of a bale, over 
42 per cent. of the tilled land of the county was devoted
exclusively to this crop. Very little machinery 
<pb id="washi177" n="177"/>
was used in the farming, the antique scooter plow and
hoe being the main reliance. The soil was rarely tilled
more than three or four inches deep. There was, in fact, a
superstition among whites as well as blacks that deep
plowing was injurious to the soil. Two-horse teams were
seldom used. Sub-soiling, fall plowing, fallowing, and
rotation of crops were little known and less practised.
The county was producing per capita per year only about
five pounds of butter, four dozen eggs, and less than three
chickens.</p>
          <p>The Negroes were with few exceptions shiftless and
improvident plantation laborers and renters. Of the
almost 13,000 Negroes in the county not more than fifty
or sixty owned land. They lived almost exclusively in
one-room cabins. Sometimes in addition to the immediate
family there were relatives and friends living and sleeping
in this one room. The common diet of these Negroes was
fat pork, corn bread, and molasses. Many meals consisted
of corn bread mixed with salt water. This, then, was the
raw material with which Booker Washington had to work
and from which has been developed, largely through his
influence, one of the most prosperous agricultural counties
in the South—a county which has been heralded in the
press as feeding itself because of the great abundance and
variety of its products. In 1910 the per capita production
for the county was: 40 gallons of milk, 11 pounds of butter,
7 dozen eggs, and 5 chickens. It must, of course, do more
than this before it will actually feed itself.</p>
          <p>Mr. Washington was constantly drumming it into the
<pb id="washi178" n="178"/>
consciousness of the Negro farmer that as long as he
remained ignorant and improvident he was sure to be 
exploited and imposed upon. He used to illustrate this by
the story of the ignorant Negro who after paying a white
man fifty cents a week for six months on a five-dollar loan
cheerfully remarked: “Dat Mr.——sho is one fine
gen'lman, cause he never has ast me fo' one cent ob dat
principal.” It may be surmised that this type of money
lender is not enthusiastic over Negro education.</p>
          <p>It is significant of the importance which Booker 
Washington attached to agriculture that the first great 
Federal official whom he invited to visit the school was the
National Secretary of Agriculture. In 1897 he got the Hon.
James Wilson, Secretary of Agriculture in President
McKinley's Cabinet, to visit Tuskegee and attend the
dedication of the school's first agricultural building.</p>
          <p>Secretary Wilson arrived at night accompanied by
Dr. J. L. M. Curry, a Southerner, a leader of the 
educational thought of the South, and the secretary of the
John F. Slater Fund Board. The students lined up on
either side of the main thoroughfare through the school
grounds with back of them a great gathering of the farmers 
from the surrounding territory and many from a 
distance. Each one of this great throng was given a pine
torch and all these torches were simultaneously lighted
as Secretary Wilson entered the school grounds. The 
Secretary and Doctor Curry, preceded by the Institute Band,
rode between these two great masses of cheering people
and flaming torches.</p>
          <pb id="washi179" n="179"/>
          <p>The next day the dedication exercises were held on a
specially constructed platform piled high with the finest
specimens of every product known to that section of the
South. On this platform, with the Secretary and Doctor
Curry, were the State Commissioner of Agriculture and
several other high State officials and many other prominent 
white citizens. This was the formal launching of
the Agricultural Department of the school. George W.
Carver, the full-blooded African and eminent agricultural
scientist, of whom mention has already been made, had
recently been placed in charge of this department. He
had come from the Agricultural Department of Iowa
State College, of which Secretary Wilson had been the
head.</p>
          <p>The annual budget of this department alone is now
nearly fifty thousand dollars a year, and more than a
thousand acres of land are cultivated under the supervision
of the agricultural staff. The modest building which
Secretary Wilson helped to dedicate has long since been
outgrown and the department is now housed in a large,
impressive brick building known as the Millbank 
Agricultural Building.</p>
          <p>Under the provisions of the Smith-Lever Act, passed
by Congress in 1914 for the purpose of aiding the States
in Agricultural Extension Work, Booker Washington
secured for Tuskegee a portion of the funds allotted to
the State of Alabama for such work. With the aid of these
funds Agricultural Extension Schools have been organized.
These schools are conducted in coöperation with the
<pb id="washi180" n="180"/>
Agricultural Department of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute
and the farm demonstration work of the United States
Department of Agriculture. They are really a two days' Short
Course in Agriculture carried out to the farmers on their own
farms. These schools have the advantage over the Short
Course given to the farmers on the Institute grounds in that
they have the farmers' problems right before them, to be
diagnosed and remedies applied at once. Through such
schools farm instruction is being carried to the Negroes of
every Black Belt County of Alabama.</p>
          <p>T. M. Campbell of the Tuskegee Institute, the District
Agent in charge of these Extension Schools for the Negro
Farmers of Alabama, reports that among the subjects taught
the men are home gardening, seed selection, repair of farm
tools, the growing of legumes as soil builders and cover 
crops, best methods of fighting the boll-weevil, poultry 
raising, hog raising, corn raising, and pasture making. The 
women are instructed in sewing, cooking, washing and ironing,
serving meals, making beds, and methods for destroying 
household pests and for the preservation of health. At all 
the meetings the names and addresses of those present are 
taken for the purpose of following them up by correspondence 
from the district agent's office, so that the benefits of the
instruction shall not be lost from one year to another. The 
slogan for these Alabama schools is: “Alabama Must Feed 
Herself.” Practically all the black farmers have shown a 
pathetic eagerness to learn and the white farmers and the 
white
<pb id="washi181" n="181"/>
demonstration agents everywhere have heartily coöperated. 
Churches, schoolhouses, and courthouses have been
placed at the district agent's disposal for the Extension
School session. One of the most hopeful features of the
experiment has been the great interest in this new and
better farming aroused among the boys and girls—an
interest which the ordinary rural school sadly fails even
in attempting to arouse. All told throughout the State
3,872 colored people attended these schools the first year.
The sessions were usually opened by a prayer offered by
one of the rural preachers. In one such prayer the
preacher said among other things: “O Lord, have mercy
on dis removable school; may it purmernate dis whole lan'
an' country!” At another meeting, after the workers
had finished a session, some of the leading colored farmers
were called on to speak. One of them opened his remarks
with the words: “I ain't no speaker, but I jes wan' a tell
you how much I done been steamilated by dis my only
two days in school!”</p>
          <p>A report of one of these schools held recently at 
Monroeville, Ala., reads: “Only subjects with which the rural
people are directly concerned are introduced and stressed
by the instructors, such as pasture making, necessary
equipment for a one and two horse farm, care of farm
tools, crop rotation, hog raising, care of the cow, seed
selection, diversified farming, how to make homemade
furniture, fighting the fly, and child welfare.</p>
          <p>“The home economics teacher attracted the attention
of all the colored farmers and also the white visitors by
<pb id="washi182" n="182"/>
constructing out of dry goods boxes an attractive and
substantial dresser and washstand, completing the same
before the audience, even to the staining, varnishing,
hanging the mirrors and attaching the draperies.” One
paper, in estimating the value of these Movable 
Agricultural Schools said: “Given ten years of good practical
agricultural instruction of the kind that was imparted
to the Negro farmers, their wives and children, for the
past three weeks in Wilcox, Perry, and Lowndes counties,
there is no reason why every Negro farmer in the State
should not only help ‘Alabama feed herself,’ but so 
increase the yield of its marketable products that the State
will be able to export millions of dollars' worth of food and
foodstuffs each year.”</p>
          <p>These Extension Schools are advertised by posters just
like a country circus, except that the language is less
grandiloquent. On the following page is a typical 
announcement presented in heavy black type on yellow paper.</p>
          <p>Thus did Booker Washington in the very year of his
death, with the aid of the National Government, launch
the last of his many means for helping the people whose
welfare lay ever nearest his heart—the Negro farmers.
These Extension Schools are literally “going out ‘into the
by-ways and hedges’ ” carrying to those who most need it
Booker Washington's gospel of better farming.</p>
          <p>One of the great secrets of Mr. Washington's success was
his unerring instinct for putting first things first. In
nothing that he did was this trait better illustrated than
in the unceasing emphasis which he placed upon the 
<pb id="washi183" n="183"/>
<figure id="fig1" entity="wash183"><p/></figure>
<pb id="washi184" n="184"/>
fundamental importance of agriculture. He never forgot
that over 80 per cent. of his people drew their living 
directly from the soil. He never ceased to impress upon the 
business and professional men of his race that their success
was dependent upon the success of the farmers; and upon
the farmers that unless they succeeded the business and
professional men could not succeed. In short, he made
Tuskegee first and foremost an agricultural school 
because the Negro race is first and foremost an agricultural
race.</p>

          <pb id="washi185" n="185"/>
          <head>CHAPTER EIGHT</head>
          <head>BOOKER WASHINGTON AND THE NEGRO<lb/>
BUSINESS MAN</head>
          <p>IN 1900 Booker Washington founded the National Negro
Business League. He was president of this league from its
foundation until his death.</p>
          <p>During the winter of 1900, after reviewing the situation
at length with his friend T. Thomas Fortune, the nestor of
Negro journalism, and at that time the dominant influence
in the New York <hi rend="italics">Age</hi>, who was spending the winter at
Tuskegee, with Mr. Scott and others of his friends, he came
to the conclusion that the time had come to bring the
business men and women of his race together in a great
national organization, with local branches throughout the
country. He decided that such an organization might be
a powerful agency in creating the race consciousness and
race pride for which he was ever striving. All the 
then-existing organizations, other than the sick and death 
benefit societies and the purely social organizations, had 
as their main purpose the assertion of the civil and 
political rights of the Negro. There was no organization 
calculated to focus the attention of the Negroes on what 
they were doing and could do for themselves in distinction 
from what was being done for them and to them. All the 
existing
<pb id="washi186" n="186"/>
associations laid their chief emphasis upon the rights of
the Negro rather than his duties. Mr. Washington held
that without in any degree sacrificing their just demands
for civil and political rights a more wholesome and 
constructive attitude could be developed by stressing the 
duties and the opportunities of the race. He believed it 
would be helpful to emphasize in an organized way what they
had done and could do in the way of business achievement
in spite of race prejudice rather than what they had not
done and could not do because of racial discrimination.
He believed they needed to have brought home to them
not how many of them had been held down, but how many
of them had come up and surmounted obstacles and 
difficulties. He believed that they should have it impressed
upon them that the application of business methods would
bring rewards to a black man just as to a white man.</p>
          <p>The first meeting of the National Negro Business
League was held in Boston, August 23 and 24, 1900.
After these sessions Booker Washington made the following 
statement of the purpose in calling the meeting and the
results obtained:</p>
          <p>“As I have travelled through the country from time to
time I have been constantly surprised to note the number
of colored men and women, often in small towns and 
remote districts, who are engaged in various lines of 
business. In many cases the business was very humble, but 
nevertheless it was sufficient to indicate the opportunities 
of the race in this direction. My observation in this 
regard led me to believe that the time had come for the 
bringing 
<pb id="washi187" n="187"/>
together of the leading and most successful colored men and
women throughout the country who are engaged in business.
After consultation with men and women in various parts of the
country it was determined to call a meeting in the city of 
Boston to organize the National Negro Business League. This 
meeting was held during the 23d and 24th of August, and it 
was generally believed that it was one of the most 
successful and helpful meetings that has ever been held 
among our people. The meeting was called with two objects 
in view: first, to bring the men and women engaged in 
business together, in order that they might get acquainted 
with each other and get information and inspiration from 
each other; secondly, to form plans for an annual meeting 
and the organization of local business leagues that should 
extend throughout the country. Both of these objects, I 
think, have been admirably accomplished. I think there has 
never been a time in the history of the race when all feel 
so much encouraged in relation to their business 
opportunities as now. The promoters of this organization 
appreciate very keenly that the race cannot depend upon mere 
material growth alone for its ultimate success, but they do 
feel that material prosperity will greatly hasten their
recognition in other directions.”</p>
          <p>The spirit and purpose of this first national convention of
Negro business men may be gathered by this quotation from the
speech of J. H. Lewis, a merchant tailor, and perhaps the 
most successful business man of the race at the time: “But 
what hope has the Negro to succeed in business?” said Mr. 
Lewis. “If you can make a better article 
<pb id="washi188" n="188"/>
than anybody else, and sell it cheaper than anybody else, you
can command the markets of the world. Produce something
that somebody else wants, whether it be a shoe string or a
savings bank, and the purchaser or patron will not trouble
himself to ask who the seller is. This same great economic 
law runs through every line of industry, whether it be 
farming, manufacturing, mercantile or professional pursuits. 
Recognize this fundamental law of trade; add to it tact, 
good manners, a resolute will, a tireless capacity for hard 
work, and you will succeed in business. I have found in my 
own experience of thirty years in business that success and 
its conditions lie around us, regardless of race or color. I 
believe that it is possible for any man with the proper 
stuff in him to make a success in business wherever he may 
be. The best and only capital necessary to begin with is 
simply honesty, industry, and common sense.”</p>
          <p>The Boston <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> of August 24, 1900, said of this
gathering: “The national convention of colored business men
began its sessions in this city yesterday in a businesslike 
and hopeful manner. This is not a political gathering. It 
is not a race gathering in the sense of one met to air 
sentimental grievances that spring from race oppositions. 
. . . President Washington believes that the security and 
progress of the colored people in this land depend upon 
their development of a moral worth commanding respect and 
an industrial capacity that will make them both useful and 
independent. He apprehends that these qualities cannot be 
bestowed as a gift of benevolence, but must be 
<pb id="washi189" n="189"/>
acquired by individual energy and struggle. ‘As I have
noted,’ he says, ‘the condition of our people in nearly every
part of our country, I have always been encouraged by the
fact that almost without exception, whether in the North
or in the South, wherever I have seen a black man who was
succeeding in his business, who was a taxpayer, and who
possessed intelligence and high character, that individual
was treated with the highest respect by the members of the
white race. In proportion as we can multiply those 
examples, North and South, will our problem be solved.’
That is the great lesson that the members of the colored
race have to learn. It will aid in extending this knowledge 
for those colored business men who have attained a
measurable degree of success in life to meet for mutual
encouragement and helpfulness.”</p>
          <p>Just fifteen years later, in August, 1915, Booker 
Washington presided over the last session of the league held
during his lifetime. This meeting also was held in Boston.
There attended it seven hundred delegates from thirty
different States. Mr. Washington in his annual address as
president summed up what had been accomplished by the
race during the fifteen-year interval and projected what
they should strive for in the future. He also took occasion
publicly to thank his foremost colleagues in developing the
work of the league, particularly Mr. Scott, the secretary of
the league. Undoubtedly he fully realized that it was his
farewell meeting. He practically collapsed before the
sessions were over. In less than three months he was dead.</p>
          <p>Among other things he said in this speech: “Since the
<pb id="washi190" n="190"/>
league met in Boston fifteen years ago, great changes have
taken place among our people in property-getting and
in the promotion of industrial and business enterprises.
These changes have taken place not solely because of the
work of the league, but this and similar organizations have
had much to do with bringing about this progress. Let
me be more specific. . . . The value of the Negro's
farm property alone is $1,142,000,000. From 1900 to
1910, the Negro's farm property increased 128 per cent.
In 1863 we had as a race 2,000 small business enterprises
of one kind and another. At the present time, the Negro
owns and operates about 43,000 concerns, with an annual
turnover of about one billion dollars. Within fifty years
we have made enough progress in business to warrant the
operation of over fifty banks. With all I have said, we are
still a poor race, as compared with many others; but I have
given these figures to indicate the direction in which we are
travelling.”</p>
          <p>Later he said: “A landless race is like a ship without a
rudder. Emphasizing again our opportunities, especially
as connected with the soil, we now have, for example, 122
poultry raisers; the number should be increased to 1,500.
We now have 200 dairymen; the number should be 
increased to 2,000. . . . We now own and operate 75
bakeries; the number can be increased to 500. From 32
brickmakers the number can be increased to 3,000. From
200 sawmills we can increase the number to 1,000.”</p>
          <p>And so he continued giving the present achievement and
future goal for many more industries. After giving these
<pb id="washi191" n="191"/>
estimates he said: “With our race, as it has been and 
always will be with all races, without economic and business
foundation, it is hardly possible to have educational and
religious growth or political freedom.</p>
          <p>“We can learn some mighty serious lessons just now
from conditions in Liberia and Hayti. For years, both in
Liberia and Hayti, literary education and politics have
been emphasized, but while doing this the people have
failed to apply themselves to the development of the soil,
mines, and forests. The result is that, from an economic
point of view, those two republics have become dependent
upon other nations and races. In both republics the 
control of finances is in the hands of other nations, this 
being true notwithstanding the fact that the two countries 
have natural resources greater than other countries similar 
in size. . . . Mere abstract, unused education means
little for a race or individual. An ounce of application is
worth a ton of abstraction. We must not be afraid to pay
the price of success in business—the price of sleepless
nights, the price of toil when others rest, the price of 
planning to-day for to-morrow, this year for next year. If
some one else endures the hardships, does the thinking, and
pays the salaries, some one else will reap the harvest and
enjoy the reward.”</p>
          <p>Just before his closing words he said: “No matter how
poor you are, how black you are, or how obscure your
present work and position, I want each one to remember
that there is a chance for him, and the more difficulties
he has to overcome the greater will be his success.”
<pb id="washi192" n="192"/>
Perhaps the most significant speech at this conference,
next to that of Booker T. Washington, was that of William
Henry Lewis who is probably the foremost lawyer of the
Negro race in America. Mr. Lewis is a graduate of 
Harvard where he distinguished himself on the football field
as well as in the classroom. After graduation from the
Harvard Law School he served with distinction in the
Massachusetts Legislature, was appointed Assistant United
States District Attorney for the Boston district by 
President Roosevelt, and became Assistant Attorney-General
of the United States under President Taft.</p>
          <p>In opening his speech Mr. Lewis said: “I do not know
why my fellow-citizens have chosen me for this honor,
except to heap coals of fire upon my head. Fifteen years
ago I was not with you. I was one of the critics, one of
the scoffers, one of those who asked, ‘What is it all about?’
‘What does it amount to?’ You have lived to confute
my judgment, and shame my sneers, and I am now making
generous acknowledgment of my error. I claim no merit
in doing this, except that I can look backward as far as
your great leader can look forward. Booker Washington
has always been from fifteen to twenty years ahead of any
other leader of his race. . . . While most of us were
agonizing over the Negro's relation to the State and his
political fortunes, Booker Washington saw that there was
a great economic empire that needed to be conquered.
He saw an emancipated race chained to the soil by the
Mortgage Crop System, and other devices, and he said,
‘You must own your own land, you must own your own
<pb id="washi193" n="193"/>
farms’—and forthwith there was a second emancipation. 
He saw the industrial trades and skilled labor pass from 
our race into other hands. He said, ‘The hands as well as 
the heads must be educated,’ and forthwith the educational 
system of America was revolutionized. He saw the money 
earned by the hard toil of black men passing into other 
men's pockets. He said, ‘The only way to save this money is 
to go into business—sell as well as buy.’ He saw that 
if the colored race was to become economically 
self-sufficient, it must engage in every form of human 
activity. Himself a successful business man as shown by
Tuskegee's millions, he has led his race to economic freedom.”</p>
          <p>Later Mr. Lewis said: “Just as in Boston three-quarters of a
century ago began the movement for Emancipation from
Slavery, so fifteen years ago appropriately began
the movement for our economical independence. . . . In 1900
there was one league with 50 members, and a few businesses
represented. To-day I am told there are 600 leagues, nearly
40,000 members, who represent every branch and variety of
business, trade and finance. When one realizes that business
rules the world, the possibility of such an organization 
seems almost unlimited in its power to help the race along 
other lines of progress.”</p>
          <p>Such a tribute from one of the most rarely and 
genuinely talented members of “The Talented Tenth” was
indeed a triumph for Booker T. Washington and his
policies. In fact, it may fairly be said that this event
marked the end of the honest opposition from this element
<pb id="washi194" n="194"/>
of the Negro race—the end of the honest opposition of a
group or section of the race in distinction from the of
course inevitable opposition of individuals here and there.</p>
          <p>One of the features of this 1915 meeting was a summary
of the economic progress of the race since the organization
of the league fifteen years before. This summary brought
out the following facts:</p>
          <p>In 1900, when the National Negro Business League
was organized, there were about 20,000 Negro business
enterprises; now there are 45,000.</p>
          <p>In 1900 there were two Negro banks; now there are
51.</p>
          <p>In 1900 Negroes were running 250 drug stores; now they
have 695.</p>
          <p>
In 1900 there were 450 undertaking businesses operated
by Negroes; now there are about 1,000.
</p>
          <p>In 1900 there were 149 Negro merchants engaged in
wholesale businesses; now there are 240.
</p>
          <p>In 1900 there were 10,000 Negro retail merchants; now
there are 25,000.</p>
          <p>In the fifteen years since the National Negro Business
League was organized, farm property owned by Negroes
has made a remarkable increase. From 1900 to 1910, the
value of domestic animals owned by Negro farmers 
increased from $85,216,337 to $177,273,785, or 107 per cent.;
poultry from $3,788,792 to $5,113,756, or 36 per cent.;
implements and machinery from $18,586,225 to $36,861,418,
or 98 per cent.; land and buildings from $69,636,420 to
$273,501,665, or 293 per cent. In ten years the total
<pb id="washi195" n="195"/>
value of farm property owned by Negroes increased from
$177,404,688 to $492,892,218, or 177 per cent.</p>
          <p>It is significant of the standing and catholicity of this
convention that the Governor of Massachusetts, Hon.
David F. Walsh, and Dr. John E. White, a leading white
Southern clergyman, both spoke at the opening meeting
at Symphony Hall.</p>
          <p>The National League is made up of more than 600 local
leagues which influence in a direct and practical way 
almost every community in the United States with any 
considerable number of Negro inhabitants. These local
leagues are all chartered, guided, and supervised by the
national organization and with them all the Secretary, Mr.
Scott, keeps in touch. From time to time he issues
pamphlets setting forth methods of organization, activities
that can be undertaken, and subjects that may be discussed
under the head of “Some things that it is possible for a
local league to do to be of service to the town or city in
which it is located” are the following:</p>
          <p>“(1) To keep a list of the young men and women who
are intelligent, trained, and qualified to fill responsible
places as clerks, accountants, salesmen, janitors, porters,
etc.; in this way a league can do much in getting suitable
occupations for as many as are competent, especially so in
Northern States.</p>
          <p>“(2) In protecting the community against fraudulent
schemes, as false stock companies, that are gotten up
solely for the purpose of defrauding colored people.</p>
          <p>(3) In fostering an interest in civic affairs, such as
<pb id="washi196" n="196"/>
sanitation, clean yards, cultivating pride in making 
attractive in appearance the home districts of our people,
and in other ways showing an interest in everything that
may make up a better community life.”</p>
          <p>In the same pamphlet under the head of “Suggested
Subjects for Discussion” comes the following list:
</p>
          <p>1. How to unify the colored people in the business 
interests of the community.

          <p>In another such pamphlet monthly meetings between
the grocers and the clubwomen are suggested. Such meetings
<pb id="washi197" n="197"/>
would have as their object the fixing of uniform and
mutually satisfactory prices and service. It is also 
recommended that Negro insurance agents constitute 
themselves unofficial health inspectors for their sections 
of the town. In this capacity they would report to the public
health committee of the local league all instances of
badly ventilated homes or schools, mosquito-breeding
spots, accumulations of rubbish and filth, or any other
conditions menacing the health of the colored citizens.
The suggestion is made that where possible reading-rooms
and bureaus of information be opened in connection with
the offices of Negro newspapers and that such rooms
place the colored papers from all sections of the country
at the disposal of the patrons after the editor has finished
with them. That several small shopkeepers club together
and employ one expert bookkeeper is another idea offered.
It is also proposed that small retailers get together for the
purpose of purchasing jointly such commodities as can be
advantageously secured in this manner. It is finally
urged that a committee be appointed each year to make a
social survey of the Negro population. This study would
show what progress had been made during the year in
all lines of endeavor and at the same time furnish a 
directory of all the business and social activities of the 
Negroes of the community. It is pointed out that the sale of
advertising space in its pages would alone more than pay
for such a directory.</p>
          <p>It will be noted that these business leagues, like all
other organizations founded or moulded by Booker 
<pb id="washi198" n="198"/>
Washington, do not stick to their lasts in any narrow sense. 
Mr. Washington never lost sight of the fact that the 
fundamental concern of all human beings was living, and that 
farming, business, education, recreation, or what not, were 
only important in so far as they made the whole of life 
better worth living. The means employed never obscured his 
vision of the aim sought as is so frequently and unhappily 
the case with lesser men.</p>
          <p>Just as at the agricultural conferences, so at these business
gatherings, Booker Washington used the methods employed
by the revivalist at the experience meeting. By so doing he
accomplished the double purpose of encouraging the
successful by the tribute of public recognition and spurring 
on the less successful and the unsuccessful to go and do 
likewise. Also by means of men and women telling their 
fellows in open meeting how they achieved their success the 
race is, as it were, revealed to itself. It was, for 
instance, through a meeting of the National Negro Business 
League that it came to light that the man who raises the 
most potatoes in the United States, and who is commonly 
known as the Potato King of the West, is a Negro—J. G. 
Groves of Edwardsville, Kan. Groves' story at one of the 
annual meetings attracted so much attention that an account 
of his life later appeared in an illustrated special article 
in the <hi rend="italics">American Magazine</hi>. It was also discovered through a 
league meeting that Scott Bond, another colored man, was 
probably the most successful farmer in the State of 
Arkansas. After he had told his story at the meeting 
<pb id="washi199" n="199"/>
of the National League held in New York in 1910 he was
pursued by cameramen and interviewers for days and
weeks and his story was spread all over the United States.
At the Chicago meeting of 1912 Watt Terry, a modest
and even shrinking colored man of Brockton, Mass.,
unfolded a remarkable story of success in spite of the
hardest and must untoward circumstances. So 
unbelievable seemed this man's story that the Executive 
Committee took up with him personally the facts of his 
recital, and later the Secretary of the League, in response
to a demand, had to vouch for his statements in open
meeting. To clinch the matter still further Mr. 
Washington wrote to the Secretary of the Young Men's 
Christian Association in Brockton, who replied that Terry's
story had, if anything, been understated rather than
overstated. Booker Washington himself told Watt Terry's
story in the pages of the <hi rend="italics">Independent</hi> for March 27, 1913.
Here it is: “. . . Mr. Terry is a modest-appearing
young man about thirty years of age. When he landed
at Brockton some twelve years ago he had, according to
his own story, a capital of just twelve cents. He found
work at first as a coachman. After a time he obtained
what he thought was a better position as janitor in the
Young Men's Christian Association Building. Some of
the members of the association succeeded in getting him a
position as a railway porter.</p>
          <p>“‘Somehow or other,’ said Terry, ‘I did not care for
that sort of work, and after a few months gave it up. I
made up my mind that I would rather work at a trade, and
<pb id="washi200" n="200"/>
tried to get work in one of the shoe factories in Brockton.
As I did not know the trade and there was a good deal of
competition for the places open to apprentices it looked
rather hopeless at first. Finally, I got the foreman to
say he would give me a chance, provided I was willing
to work for two weeks without pay. I accepted that offer
and made up my mind to make the most of those two
weeks.’</p>
          <p>“At the end of the two weeks Terry had done so well
that he was given a position in which he earned $7 a week.
By sticking close to his job and making the most of his
opportunities he was gradually promoted until he earned
first $10, then $15, $18, and finally $25 a week.</p>
          <p>“‘I had some difficulties at first,’ said Terry. ‘The
other men did not like me at first and showed it. 
However, I stuck to the job, kept on smiling, and it was
not long before I was on just as good terms with the men
in the shop as I cared to be. As I did not have much
opportunity to spend my money, I found it easier to save.’</p>
          <p>“When Terry reached the point where he was earning
$25 a week his wife was earning $9 as matron in the
Brockton railway station, and they both saved their
money. Meanwhile Terry had begun to buy and sell
real estate in a small way. One day he sold a house and
lot upon which he cleared as commission $100.</p>
          <p>“‘That seemed to settle the question of my future,’
said Mr. Terry. ‘I decided to go into the real estate
business.’</p>
          <p>“He added that at the present time his gross income
<pb id="washi201" n="201"/>
from his houses was between $6,000 and $7,000 per month.
Altogether, including several store buildings and two
apartment houses containing fifty-four suites of rooms,
Mr. Terry owns 222 buildings in Brockton. One of
these buildings is leased by the United States Government 
for the use of the post-office; another is rented for a
public library and reading-room by the city.</p>
          <p>“I should not, perhaps, have dared to make this statement 
if I had not confirmed the truth of Mr. Terry's
statement by independent inquiry. In a recent letter
from Secretary White, of the Brockton Young Men's
Christian Association, he says: ‘Some weeks ago I wrote
you relative to our mutual friend (Watt Terry's) business, 
but now I want to enclose a clipping from the tax
list which you will see is positive evidence that the time
the taxes were recorded he was carrying well on to $300,000
and I know that his purchase of $120,000 occurred since
that time. It is certainly a most wonderful development
within a few years.’</p>
          <p>“I ought to add that during all the time that Mr.
Terry has been in Brockton he has been connected with
the Young Men's Christian Association, and not long ago
he contributed $1,000 toward the support of that 
institution.</p>
          <p>“Many persons will, perhaps, feel that money which is
acquired in this rapid way is likely to do the person who
obtains it as much harm as it does good. I confess that
it seems to me that the same amount of money acquired
more slowly would mean more to the man who gained it.
<pb id="washi202" n="202"/>
On the whole, however, the Negro race has not reached
the point where it has been troubled by the number of
its millionaires. And if getting slowly and laboriously
is a good discipline, the Negro has almost a surplus of that
kind of blessing. I ought to add, also, in justice to Mr.
Terry, that from all I can learn, his rapid rise has neither
injured his character nor destroyed his good sense. I
suspect that the effort to keep all those houses rented and
the effort to pay interest on his mortgages has had a
tendency to make him humble.”</p>
          <p>Although Watt Terry's success is, of course, phenomenal
he is only one of the many notably successful Negro 
business men who have told their stories at meetings of
the National Negro Business League. Neither is Mr.
Terry the only Negro who has made a big success in real
estate. At the meeting of the league already described,
held in Boston in 1915, Mr. Washington introduced Philip
A. Payton, Jr., of New York City; E. C. Brown, of 
Philadelphia, Pa.; and Watt Terry, of Brockton, Mass.; as
the three largest real estate operators of the Negro race.
Philip A. Payton, Jr., was the pioneer in opening the
Harlem district in New York City to settlement by
Negroes, who had formerly been excluded from all decent
portions of the city and obliged to live on San Juan Hill
and in other sections of unsavory reputation. E. C. Brown
made money in real estate in Newport News and Norfolk,
Va., and headed movements for the establishment of
Negro banks in both of these cities. Afterward he moved
to Philadelphia, where he has opened a bank, and also
<pb id="washi203" n="203"/>
conducts a real estate business on Broad Street—the
only Negro, it is said, who conducts a large business 
enterprise on this important thoroughfare. At the same 
meeting it was brought out that a Negro by the name of
Phillip J. Allston was chemist for the Potter Chemical
Company, having risen from bottle-washer to that 
responsible post. The story of J. S. Trower, caterer, of
Philadelphia, showed that he was frequently engaged for
the most important functions in the city and had been
regularly employed by the Cramps Company, shipbuilders,
to take charge of the catering in connection with the
ceremonies accompanying the launching of new ships for
the Navy. Mrs. Bell Davis of Indianapolis, Ind., has
become equally successful as a caterer. When the 
National Negro Business League met in Indianapolis it was
she who served the annual banquet. Booker Washington
took the greatest satisfaction in disclosing her 
achievements to the Negro people who had previously known
little or nothing about her. He thus introduced her
at a meeting of the League, “Mrs. Bell Davis, a widow,
the celebrated caterer of Indianapolis, Ind., who has
served banquets and receptions in honor of Presidents
and Vice-Presidents of the United States, who owns a
stock of Haviland china, linen, and silverware valued at
thousands of dollars, all unencumbered, furnishes another
illustration of what heights can be attained in the 
commercial world by strenuous effort and making use of
every little opportunity which presents itself. Mrs.
Davis' humble beginnings, hardships encountered, and
<pb id="washi204" n="204"/>
success achieved would make three chapters of a most
interesting biography.”</p>
          <p>Among the men spoken of by Booker Washington at
the Philadelphia meeting of the Business League was
Heman E. Perry, the founder of the first and only old
line legal reserve life insurance company operated by and
for Negroes. In his efforts to raise the $100,000 initial
capital required by the law of his State—Georgia—Mr.
Perry had tramped all over the United States at least
three times. Finally, having tried every conceivable
source without securing the required amount, he returned
to all the subscribers of capital stock the money they
had paid in plus 4 per cent. interest. This action so
inspired the confidence of the subscribers that almost
without exception they not only returned the money, but
subscribed for additional stock with the result that the
initial capital stock was oversubscribed. When examined
by the State Insurance Department three years after it
opened business this company was found to have a gross
income of almost $77,000 and admitted assets of almost
$160,000. Each subsequent examination by the State
Department has showed a healthy growth, low mortality,
good judgment in the selection of risks, prompt payment of
claims, careful management, and a sound financial condition.
By means of this company, known as the Standard Life
Insurance Company, life insurance may be had by any
Negro under the same conditions, with the same degree of
security, and at the same rates as a white man.</p>
          <p>Among the other notably successful Negro business
<pb id="washi205" n="205"/>
men who have told their stories at meetings of the league
are the following: Victor H. Tulane, of Montgomery,
Ala., whose story of small beginnings and present success
stirred his fellows at a meeting of the league. Mr. Tulane
entered the grocery business twenty-five years ago, a
business that any ambitious man of his race may enter,
requiring small capital but unlimited patience and close
attention to business. He now owns considerable property, 
and is a factor in all matters that concern his race
in Montgomery, being regarded by white and colored
citizens alike as Montgomery's first colored citizen. Mr.
Tulane says: “Twenty-five years ago I was a renter; to-day
I am landlord of not a few tenants. Twenty-five years
ago my stock represented less than a hundred dollars; at
the present time it values several thousands. 
Twenty-five years ago I had but one helper—a small boy; 
to-day I employ on an average of seven assistants the year 
round, excluding my wife and self. Twenty-five years ago I
bought lard in five-pound quantities; to-day I purchase
by the barrel. Twenty-five years ago I bought salt in
ten-cent quantities; at present I buy it in ton lots.
Twenty-three years ago I was unable to secure credit to
the amount of three dollars, but since that period the very
house that then refused me has credited me at one time
with several hundred times this amount, and to-day it is
not, how much do you owe?—but, how much do you want?
Twenty years ago my business barely required the service
of one horse and wagon; at present it demands the use of
several. Twenty years ago I did an annual business of
<pb id="washi206" n="206"/>
something less than a thousand dollars; during several years
since that time the value of my business has exceeded $40,000
per year.” It is Mr. Tulane's boast that he has not been 
denied credit during his business career except the one time 
mentioned above, and that he has never been threatened or 
sued in connection with the collection of a debt.</p>
          <p>Another man's story that came out at the meeting of the
National Negro Business League is the story of Charles H.
Anderson, a wholesale and retail fish and oyster dealer. He
conducts a fish, oyster, and game business in Jacksonville, 
Fla., which supplies the largest hotels and many of 
Jacksonville's richest white families. He is also interested 
in a fish and oyster packing business on the Florida coast, 
and is the cashier of the colored bank at Jacksonville. A 
speaker at the league meeting held in the John Wanamaker 
store, Philadelphia, in August, 1913, referred to Mr. 
Anderson as follows: “The first time I saw this gentleman 
was fourteen years ago, when he was standing up behind a 
white sheet that had a round hole cut in it, bravely 
negotiating his head and face as a target; he was working 
for a man who was running one of those games known as: 
‘Every-time-you-hit-the-nigger's-head-you-geta-fine-cigar!’ 
(Uproarious laughter.) There I found him fourteen years
ago, posing as a target, and for the magnificent sum of five
cents anybody could have secured the privilege of throwing
three balls at his face. (Prolonged laughter and applause 
as Mr. Anderson stepped forward and was introduced to Hon. 
John Wanamaker, who 
<pb id="washi207" n="207"/>
warmly shook his hand.) To-day this young man is one
of the most competent and one of the most prosperous
business men of our race, regardless of section, North,
South, East, or West. (Hearty applause.) Recently he
was offered $18,000 for one piece of property which he
owns in Jacksonville, Fla., and if he would sell out to
me to-day all of his real estate and other holdings and
equities, I would be willing to give him my check for
$75,000.”</p>
          <p>Others are: Edward C. Berry of Athens, Ohio, who owns
and operates a family hotel in which he does a business of
$25,000 to $35,000 a year; J. Walter Hodge of Indianapolis, 
Ind., who, inspired by the recitals at the Business
League meetings, gave up his job as a Pullman car porter,
after he had saved some money, and is now the owner of a
large real estate business; Thomas H. Hayes who, starting
as a day laborer for the Southern Railway, now controls
probably the largest undertaking establishment in 
Memphis, Tenn.</p>
          <p>Perhaps the most remarkable story of business success
ever told before a meeting of the league was that of J.
H. Blodgett of Jacksonville, Fla. Mr. Blodgett told his
story at the sessions of the league held in Philadelphia
in 1913 at the Academy of Music. By request he in part
repeated it at the meeting held in the Wanamaker Store
the following day. Mr. Blodgett is an ex-slave. He has
had no education whatever except what he has picked up
in his long and successful struggle with life's sternest 
realities. We will give his story in his own language. Bear
<pb id="washi208" n="208"/>
in mind that this is the language, as taken down verbatim
by a stenographer at the time, of a totally unschooled
ex-slave. He said: “Now I want to say I went to 
Jacksonville nineteen years ago with the magnificent sum of 
a dollar and ten cents in my pocket. (Laughter.) I also
had an extra suit of underclothing in a paper bag; that
was all the baggage I had as a boarder. (Laughter.) I
was also arrested as a tramp for having on a straw hat in
the winter time. (Hearty laughter.) And I say all this
especially to you young men who are present here to-night,
for so many of our young men seem to think that they
can't start or succeed in business unless somebody shoves
them off the bank into the water of opportunity and makes
them swim for themselves; I simply want to say this to
you young men, I started with $1.10 and one extra suit
of underclothing in a paper bag—(laughter)—and to-day
I pay more taxes than any Negro in Florida. (Prolonged
applause.) I have had all sorts of struggles and difficulties
to contend with, but you can't get away from it—if
you get anything in this United States of America now,
you have got to work for it. (Hearty applause.) The
white people all over this country have ‘weaned the
Negro.’ (Laughter and applause.) Dr. Washington has
been going all over this country boasting about what you
could do and what our race has done, and the white man
is just quietly and gently and in every way telling us:
‘Go thou and do what Dr. Washington said you could
do.’ (Prolonged laughter and applause.)</p>
          <p>“When I began, I commenced working for a railroad
<pb id="washi209" n="209"/>
company; I had a splendid job—washing cars for a dollar
and five cents a day; I got $8.40 from the railroad every
eight days. After working for a month and a half I
saved enough money to send back and bring my wife
from Charleston, South Carolina, to Jacksonville. Both
of us went to work; we opened a little boarding-house;
she ran that, and when my $1.05 a day enabled me to save
as much as one hundred dollars, I quit that job and began
to bustle for myself. I told the white man I was working
under: ‘You don't know that a Negro with $100 in cash
is a rare thing among my people. I'm going to strike out
and see what I can do by myself.’ I made up my mind
that if all of the big Negroes that I had heard of, read
about, and talked with, if they could get honor and 
recognition by having brains, money, and ability, there was
nothing the matter with me and my poor little wife to
prevent us from getting up, too; so I went to work and 
determined to work day and night, if need be, to get some
money, and other things necessary to succeed in life. I
wanted money because I had seen and suffered so many
humiliations put on the man who does not have money.
(Applause.)</p>
          <p>“The first time I saw this distinguished gentleman
(pointing to Dr. Booker T. Washington) I was laying
brick in Jacksonville, Fla., at $1.25 a day, and he drove
by in company with Mr. James W. Johnson, Mr. J. 
Rosamond Johnson, and another gentleman. I had always
loved the big men of my race; even as a little boy I 
delighted to hear of what they had achieved, and when I
<pb id="washi210" n="210"/>
heard that the great Booker T. Washington was in
town, I quit my job for that day, went to the place where
he spoke, walked up close, and was hoping somebody would
do me the honor of introducing me. But I found the
gentlemen who had him in charge were introducing him
to nobody but the big Negroes, and the big Negroes were
shaking hands with him and completely monopolizing
Booker T. Washington. (Prolonged laughter.) I did not
like to be rude and therefore did not push through the
crowd and shake hands with him anyway, as I felt like
doing. I was nothing but a poor brick-layer, nobody
would introduce me, but I heard his grand speech, was
richly benefited and inspired by all he said, and when I
went away I made a solemn vow to myself. I said: ‘If
God be with me, I mean to so work and conduct myself
so that some day I shall deserve to shake hands with
Booker T. Washington.’ (Hearty applause.) Now let
me tell you the sequel of the story. Away down in Florida, 
in my humble home in Jacksonville, there is a room
named ‘Booker T. Washington.’ (Applause.) I have
set apart and dedicated a portion of my home in honor of
this distinguished gentleman and leader of our race.
(Applause.) He is the first human being on earth I have
ever permitted to sleep in it, and his good wife is the 
first woman and second person I have ever permitted to 
sleep in that room. (Prolonged laughter and applause.) We
love him in the South, both Negro and white man!
(Hearty applause.) Booker T. Washington's name is a
monument of strength because he is teaching the Negro
<pb id="washi211" n="211"/>
to use his hands and head in order to be useful in the 
community and to achieve success. (Applause.)</p>
          <p>“I have been sick this summer and just got back from
Saratoga—(prolonged applause)—of course all men who
get rich go to Saratoga. (Laughter and applause.) While
there I met some folks, and in the course of my remarks
I had occasion to remind them that Dr. Booker T. 
Washington, while an earnest advocate of industrial 
training, is not an enemy or opposed to higher education. 
There was a man from the British West Indies who began to
speak on the subject of the Negro; he began to orate around,
began to tell how the Negro must expect to rise in the
world; oh! he made a magnificent speech going to show
that there was nothing in the world like higher education
for the Negro; he even said that the Negro race would
never amount to anything and get its rights until every
one of us had secured a college education. (Laughter.)
Why, you ought to have been there and heard him orate;
he took us all through Greek, Roman, ancient, and medieval 
history; across the Alps and all around the Egyptian
pyramid—(hearty laughter)—and even cited the Druids
of old to testify to the grandeur and necessity of higher
education for the Negro. After he got through orating I
said to him: ‘Brother, I was down to a meeting of Negroes
in the State of Florida—at the State Business League,
and I saw sitting on one bench eleven (11) Negro men
whose combined wealth would amount to more than one
million dollars, and not one of them ever saw the inside of
a college.’ (Prolonged applause, mingled with laughter.)
<pb id="washi212" n="212"/>
And I said to him further than that: ‘If any of you 
gentlemen who claim to be educated in the British West
Indies, and all you gentlemen who hail from Beloit 
College (wherever it is)—if you can fool any one of 
those eleven Negroes out of one dime, I will give you ten 
dollars!’ (Laughter and applause.) Yes, sir, without much 
education these men own their own homes and dozens of
homes in which other people live; they are self-sustaining
and independent, and can write their names to checks
away up in the thousands of dollars; they live in neat,
comfortable, well-appointed homes and enjoy the respect
and esteem of their neighbors—black as well as white.
‘Now, sir,’ I turned to him and asked him, ‘will you kindly
tell me what is your occupation in life and what you have
been able to accomplish with all this higher education
you have been talking about?’ I found out that he was a
waiter in the United States Hotel. (Laughter.) I said
to him further: ‘My brother, I don't claim to be an 
educated man, but live in a villa of my own; I own 
considerable real estate, and my dear little wife rides 
around in our own $5,500 Packard automobile, all paid for.’ 
(Prolonged applause and laughter.)</p>
          <p>“I am somewhat of a carpenter and builder; I went
to work, bought some ground while it was cheap and at a
time when everything in Jacksonville was at low tide;
there were plenty of sick Yankees whose investments
had depreciated and I invested what money I had in
some land. I would build a house, then sell it; buy more
land, build another house and sell that; after a while I
<pb id="washi213" n="213"/>
was able to build three houses and sell two, build two and 
sell one and so on—(applause)—until pretty soon I 
found myself in the real estate business, buying land and 
building and selling houses. In this way I have gone on 
building my own houses until now I have plenty to support 
myself and that dear little red-headed woman who has a seat 
somewhere in this beautiful audience. (Laughter and 
applause.) She doesn't have to keep a boardinghouse any 
more; she is on the retired list. (Laughter and applause.) 
We have made enough to keep from doing that.”</p>
          <p>At this point Dr. Washington asked, “How many houses do
you own?”</p>
          <p>Mr. Blodgett replied: “I have been selling houses pretty
rapidly during the last few years, but I have built—and 
right here I want to say that while my subject is ‘Building 
and Contracting’ I have never built a house for anybody but
myself. I build my own property. I have built since the 
fire we had in Jacksonville in 1902 two hundred and eight 
houses of my own. (Prolonged applause.) I have sold a good 
many of them. When I realized that I was beginning to get 
old and not in such good physical condition as I used to 
be, I was afraid I might get afflicted with tuberculosis, 
or appendicitis, or some of these other high-sounding 
diseases the doctors now talk about—(laughter)—and 
so I thought it best to convert some of my estate into 
another form that could be more easily handled by my better 
half when I had gone to inhabit my mansion in the skies. 
(Laughter.) So I
<pb id="washi214" n="214"/>
have begun to sell off some of my property and get out of
debt. I now have one hundred and twenty-one houses, the
rents from which amount to a little over twenty-five hundred
dollars a month. (Prolonged applause.) I have invested my
money in recent years in what I call ‘grip-sack’ securities, 
so that if there should be any little unpleasantness among the
races, I can go to my safe and grab that grip-sack. (Prolonged
laughter and applause.) You see if there should ever be any
friction or trouble, I can grab my grip-sack, jump into a
powerful machine, and come up here around Philadelphia,
‘The City of Brotherly Love’ or over here in Canada, and I
can sit down at my leisure and read in the papers what they
are doing down there. (Prolonged laughter.)</p>
          <p>“Dr. Washington has been in my home in Jacksonville; I
have now had the honor of not only shaking hands with him,
but of having him as my special guest. I know I am going to
make one break here now, I'm going to say something that my
little modest wife may not like me to say, but I hope she 
will excuse just this one time (laughter)—for everybody 
knows that’ I ain't very bright anyhow—not really 
responsible. (Prolonged laughter.) I want to say this, not 
in a boasting way—I live in the best home of any Negro 
in this country I have so far seen. (Hearty applause.) I 
live in a home—we call it ‘Blodgett Villa’; we have 
flowers and lawns and vines and shrubbery, a nice greenhouse
and all those things that go to make up for higher 
civilization. I surrounded myself with all these things to 
show that the Negro has the same taste,
<pb id="washi215" n="215"/>
the same yearning for higher civilization that the white man
has whenever he has the money to afford it. (Applause.) You
know they have been saying all these years that the Negro is
coarse and vicious, that he is kin to the monkey—
(laughter)—and that we do not appreciate those things 
that make for higher civilization such as flowers, 
hothouses, neatly kept houses and lawns, automobiles, and 
such things, so I went and got them. (Applause.) When you 
step inside of Mrs. Blodgett's home there you will find art 
and music and literature, and if you can find anything in 
there that does not tend toward the higher civilization, 
you have my promise and consent to throw it outdoors. 
(Laughter and applause.) . . .</p>
          <p>“I remember when I was a drayman on the streets of
Jacksonville; I was a great big man, even heavier than
I am now: I wore a pair of magnificent feet appropriate to my
size, and when I drove along everybody whistled and called
me ‘Old Big One.’ Since that time I have graduated from a
drayman to what the program calls me: a ‘Builder and
Contractor,’ and when they see me now riding through the
streets of Jacksonville in my $5,500 Packard automobile, if 
one of those Negroes should call me ‘Old Big One,’ I would 
put him in jail. (Laughter and applause.) I am interested in
business with white men, and I tell you when a Negro gets to
the point where he makes cash deposits in a white man's 
bank—say $5,000 this week, $2,000 next week, and so on, 
they will begin to discover you, honor and respect you. If 
you deposit $2,000 this week, the bank president will know 
about
<pb id="washi216" n="216"/>
it, and when it gets to the place that you have got in the 
bank $25,000, why this man even (pointing to an ebony black 
man in the audience) will have become a bright mulatto!”</p>
          <p>Perhaps the most unique and impressive session of the
National Negro Business League was that held at the
invitation of John Wanamaker in his great department store in
Philadelphia in 1913. One of the most interesting talks at 
this meeting was that of Charles Banks of Mound Bayou, Miss.
Mr. Banks has been referred to in an earlier chapter. He has
often been called the J. Pierpont Morgan of his race. He said
in part: “I live in the little town of Mound Bayou, Miss., 
that was founded by Isaiah T. Montgomery, an ex-slave of
Jefferson Davis, the President of the Southern Confederacy.
Mr. Montgomery, the ex-slave in question, is present at this
meeting. We live in what is called the ‘Black Belt of
Mississippi’ and our plantations embrace some of the richest
and most fertile land that can be found in the entire 
‘Delta.’ In some parts of the ‘Delta’ the Negro population 
outnumbers the white population in a ratio of five to one. 
In the town in which I live (Mound Bayou) we outnumber the 
white population in a ratio of five to nothing. (Laughter 
and applause.)</p>
          <p>“Instead of whining and lamenting our lot, and bemoaning
the racial prejudice which exists in our section of the 
country, we are taking advantage of some of the opposition 
and the tendency to segregate us and we are trying to show, 
through the leadership of this ex-slave of
<pb id="washi217" n="217"/>
Jefferson Davis, that it is possible for us to build up a
Negro community, a town owned and controlled by
Negroes right there under his direct supervision. And as
a result, on the Yazoo and Mound Bayou Branch of the
Yazoo Central Railroad, we have one of the best-governed
and most prosperous towns on the whole line. We have
something like thirty to forty thousand acres of land in
that rich and fertile country owned and controlled 
exclusively by Negro men and women. We have there
the little town of Mound Bayou, which it is our privilege
to represent, and so far as its management or government
is concerned, we have control of everything. There we
have a Negro Depot Agent, a Negro Express Agent, a
Negro Postmaster, a Negro Mayor, a Board of Negro
Aldermen and City Councilmen, and every other official
of the city administration is a full-fledged Negro. In
that town I am the banker, and I pass for a Negro.”
(Laughter and applause followed this sally, as the speaker
is the blackest of full-blooded Africans.)</p>
          <p>In concluding his address of welcome on this occasion
Mr. Wanamaker said: “I do hope that meetings like this
will come often and be held in every large city in the North.
In exhibiting to the world the successful business men
and women of your race, your league is doing exactly
what every good merchant legitimately does, that is—you are showing your goods. (Laughter.) And you are
delivering the goods. (Prolonged applause.) Your league
is making an ‘Annual Report’ as it were; it is making
a ‘Yearly Inventory’ of what your race has on hand, and
<pb id="washi218" n="218"/>
though this large hall has been the scene of many delightful 
occasions (mainly connected with this business) your
coming here to-day is the first meeting of its kind.
(Applause.) I believe that this meeting ought to be put
down as historical, and should serve as a set-off-in 
striking contrast to the stoning of William Lloyd Garrison,
in the streets of Philadelphia, scarcely more than fifty
years ago. (Prolonged applause.) This meeting will
simply help to balance your account. (Applause.) The
world is moving on, and it is a glorious thing to-day to
find that, instead of stepping backward—contrary to the
predictions of some—you are making such splendid strides
forward under the fine leadership of Dr. Booker T. 
Washington—(applause)—as evidenced in this Business 
League Convention.</p>
          <p>“In closing I want not only to pay just tribute to what
you have achieved in music, in education, and religious
life, but I think it fitting, on this occasion, and I have
planned to show you a fine painting from the brush of the
greatest artist of your race—the son of Bishop Tanner.
I have seen his handiwork in some of the art galleries of
the first rank in Europe. For the most part his paintings
are religious in conception, and the peculiar beauty of
them is that they deal with the heart, even as they are fine
expressions of art. (Applause.) Before you leave I have
planned to show you several other pictures of real merit
that members of your race have produced. (Applause.)</p>
          <p>“And oh—when I consider all these things, and when
I gazed upon this vast and beautiful audience a few
<pb id="washi219" n="219"/>
minutes ago, as you were singing so fervently our national
anthem, ‘America,’ as I looked over the sea of earnest,
intelligent faces, I wondered how on earth we could sing that
song for a hundred years or more—I wondered how it was
possible to keep a race like yours enslaved while, for 
years and years, the people of this nation sang that last 
line of that song, ‘Let freedom ring!!!’” (Prolonged 
applause, tumultuous cheering, and the waving of countless 
handkerchiefs as Mr. Wanamaker resumed his seat.)</p>
          <p>Aside from having the successful colored men and women
tell one another and their less-successful fellows how they 
had achieved their success at these sessions of the league, 
Booker Washington also arranged to have one or more 
prominent white men speak. His reason for this, aside from 
the obvious one of helping to foster friendly feeling 
between the races, was, it may safely be hazarded, to 
impress upon his people that white people succeed by the 
possession and the application of the same qualities which 
bring success to colored people. At the Chicago meeting of 
the league in 1912 Julius Rosenwald spoke—Julius 
Rosenwald, the Jewish philanthropist who has done and is
doing so much to help the Negro. It was he who offered
$25,000 to any city in the United States which would raise
$75,000 for a Young Men's Christian Association Building for
colored men. It is he also who is helping Tuskegee in the
building of rural schoolhouses as was explained in the third
chapter. He is one of Tuskegee's trustees.</p>
          <p>The late Robert C. Ogden, the New York manager of the
<pb id="washi220" n="220"/>
Wanamaker business, addressed the convention of 1905 in
New York. He was a man whom Booker Washington delighted 
to hold up to his people as an example of what a man
could accomplish through his own unaided efforts. He had
begun his business career at a salary of $5 a week, and from
that as his starting-point he had risen to be the New York 
head of the greatest department store business in the 
country. He was for twenty-five years President of the Board 
of Trustees of Hampton, a member of the Tuskegee Board, and 
the originator and host of the annual educational 
pilgrimages which gave leading Northerners a first hand and 
intelligent insight into the dire need of education for the 
masses of the people both white and black throughout the 
South. Much of the educational activity in the South to-day 
may be traced to the early Ogden educational pilgrimages.</p>
          <p>Theodore Roosevelt spoke at the New York meeting in 1910.
He had just returned from Africa. He said later that nothing
connected with his homecoming had touched him so deeply as
the ovation given him by these, his fellow-citizens of African
descent. Among other white men who have spoken before the
league are Henry Clews, the banker; Dr. H. B. Frissell, the
Principal of Hampton Institute, and Dr. J. H. Dillard, 
president of the Anna T. Jeanes Foundation of Negro Rural 
Schools.</p>
          <p>One of Mr. Washington's many methods for inspiring his
people to strive for business efficiency and success was to
excite their imaginations by holding up before them the
achievements of such men as John Wanamaker, Robert
<pb id="washi221" n="221"/>
C. Ogden, William H. Baldwin, Jr., Henry H. Rogers,
Julius Rosenwald, the Rockefellers, and Andrew Carnegie.</p>
          <p>Out of the National Negro Business League have 
developed the following organizations which are affiliated
with it:</p>
          <p>The National Negro Funeral Directors' Association,</p>
          <p>
The National Negro Press Association,</p>
          <p>
The National Negro Bar Association,
</p>
          <p>The National Negro Retail Merchants' Association,</p>
          <p>
The National Association of Negro Insurance Men.</p>
          <p>Booker Washington was able to speak with assurance
and authority to the business men of his race because he
practised what he preached. The business methods which
he employed in conducting the business, in distinction
from the educational affairs, of Tuskegee Institute, 
compare favorably with those of the best-managed industrial
corporations. He may even have appeared to be 
over-insistent upon business accuracy, system, and 
efficiency, so anxious was he to belie the popular notion 
that Negroes must of necessity, because they are Negroes, 
be slipshod and unsystematic. In refutation of this familiar 
accusation he built up an institution almost as large as 
Harvard University which runs like clockwork without a single
white man or woman having any part in its actual 
administration. Tuskegee itself is the most notable example
of its founder's method of argument. No person knowing
the facts about Tuskegee can ever again honestly say that
Negroes are always and necessarily slipshod and 
unsystematic in their business methods.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER NINE</head>
          <head>BOOKER WASHINGTON AMONG HIS<lb/>
STUDENTS</head>
          <p>IN SPITE of his absorption in guiding the destinies of his 
race Booker Washington never lost interest in individuals 
however humble or in their individual affairs however small. 
This was strikingly shown in his relations to his students. 
He never wearied in his efforts to help in the solution of 
the life problems of the hundreds of raw boys and girls who 
each year flocked to Tuskegee and to Booker Washington with 
little but hope and ambition upon which to build their 
careers. With many of these newcomers he not infrequently 
had his initial talk before they knew who he was. This was 
made easy by his simple and unassuming manner, which was 
the exact opposite to what these unsophisticated youths 
expected in a great man. One of the graduates of Tuskegee 
in the book, “Tuskegee and Its People,” thus describes his 
first meeting with Booker Washington. His experience was 
almost identical with that of many another entering student. 
He says:</p>
          <p>“My first glimpse of Mr. Washington was had in the depot at
Montgomery, Ala., where a friend and I, on our way to
Tuskegee, had changed cars for the Tuskegee train. Two
gentlemen came into the waiting-room where we were
<pb id="washi223" n="223"/>
seated, one a man of splendid appearance and address, the 
other a most ordinary appearing individual, we thought. The 
latter, addressing us, inquired our destination. Upon 
being told that we were going to Tuskegee, he remarked that 
he had heard that Tuskegee was a very hard place—a 
place where students were given too much to do, and where 
the food was very simple and coarse. He was afraid we would 
not stay there three months. We assured him that we were 
not afraid of hard work, and meant to finish the course of 
study at Tuskegee at all hazards. He then left us. Very 
soon after the gentleman who had so favorably impressed us, 
and whom we afterward found to be the treasurer of the 
Tuskegee Institute, Mr. Warren Logan, came back and told us 
our interlocutor was none other than the Principal of the 
school to which we were going.”</p>
          <p>Booker Washington was always keenly interested to get at
the reasons which had impelled the new students to come, and
they would naturally state these reasons more freely to a 
friendly unknown person than they would to the Principal 
of the school. As previously mentioned, Booker Washington 
always kept his ear to the ground. These raw boys and girls 
brought him fresh and frank messages as to how the people 
were thinking and feeling about Tuskegee and those things 
for which it stands.</p>
          <p>Some time after Mr. Washington's death the students of the
Senior Class were asked to write brief themes describing 
their first impressions of him. In one of these themes the 
boy writer says, “His general attitude did not
<pb id="washi224" n="224"/>
bear out my idea of how a great man should appear. I
expected to see him with a diamond ring and riding in an
automobile on a pleasure trip, which most great men do. He
was quiet, not overdressed, nor yet self-conscious of the
position he held and the influence he wielded among the
people. He seemed to me a man of great thoughts, yet not
realizing his greatness.” Another boy writes: “One of my 
first questions after arriving at Tuskegee, September 9, 
1912, and registering as a student was to ask, where is Mr. 
Washington? I was told that he hardly ever stayed here but 
was often in the North. Two weeks later he came, and my 
first opportunity to see him was one day on the street. I 
was so enthused over him that I went to my room and wrote 
a letter home trying to describe him.</p>
          <p>“The following Sunday night he lectured in the Chapel. His
title was, ‘Have a Place to Put Everything and Put Everything
in That Place.’ In his talk he said: ‘There are many people 
who have no system about their work nor home. Often you visit
persons' homes and every member of the family is looking for
the broom. The same is true of a match when the time comes
to light the lamp.’</p>
          <p>“That talk was the most impressive one that I ever heard
before or since. From that talk I have reaped more benefit
than any other. It was the talk that I took in and began
practising. I first started in my room having a place to put
everything and putting everything in that place. After 
getting my room systematized I then began putting this talk 
in practise at my work, etc. . . .”</p>
          <p>The next quotation is from the paper of a native African
<pb id="washi225" n="225"/>
boy. He says: “My first impression, or, at least, the first
time I heard the name of Booker T. Washington, was about
the year 1902. I was then a young boy, just arrived in one
of the Native Training Institutions existing in South
Africa. These schools train young native boys primarily
to become teachers in their communities. As a native
African I had just acquired the elementary use of the
English language, when the following incident took place:
One, a native teacher from the upper part of the country,
was announced and that he was to give a lecture to the
‘Boys' Saturday Evening Society.’</p>
          <p>“The meeting assembled, and I at once heard that the
lecture was about a boy—Booker T. Washington—who
obtained an education through his struggles. . . . I
did not hear or understand more. But it is strange to say
that this name was pinned in the bottom of my heart. . . .</p>
          <p>“It was during the coronation of King George V of
England that I saw this name. I had now finished that
school and was teaching. It was printed in a native
paper that Booker T. Washington, an American Negro,
made an excellent speech. I cannot, however, say the
exact words of the editor, which were in greatest praise of
that man, nor do I recall the circumstances under which
Mr. Washington had spoken.</p>
          <p>“When I wanted to come to school in this country I
made up my mind to find the school—as I found later he
was principal of one—where this man was leader; and so I
came to Tuskegee Institute. I found the editor had well
described the man's character and disposition.”</p>
          <pb id="washi226" n="226"/>
          <p>Still another boy writes: “I first saw Dr. Washington
at the Appalachian Exposition held at Knoxville, Tenn.,
in 1912. It was Negro Day and there were thousands of
Negroes out to hear Dr. Washington speak. . . . At
times he would make the people laugh and then again he
would have a few crying. When I saw the tears in the
eyes of his listeners, I looked at Dr. Washington and
thought of him with awe because he was so highly honored.
I thought of him with admiration because he could speak so
well, and I thought of him with pride because he was a
Negro. . . . His speech made me feel as if there were
really a few Negro men and women in the world who were
making a mark, and that there was a chance for more.”</p>
          <p>Booker Washington's interest in the lives of his students,
as in all things else, showed his combination of breadth of
view and attention to what less-thorough persons would
have considered trivial details. When, for instance, in
1913 Tuskegee was visited by one of the very infrequent
snowstorms which occur so far South, he himself went from
building to building to see that they were properly heated
and to many of the rooms, particularly of the poorer
students, to make sure that they had sufficient bedclothes. 
During the last three winters of his life he had a
confidential agent make an early morning tour of all the
dormitories to make sure that they were so heated that the
students might dress in comfort on getting up in the
morning.</p>
          <p>Also when the weather was unusually cold he would
make sure that the boys who drove the teams that hauled
<pb id="washi227" n="227"/>
wood and other supplies were provided with gloves and
warm clothing. One cold night he sent for Mr. Palmer,
the Registrar of the school, and said to him: “I wish you
would seek out the poor worthy students and see that it is
made possible for them to secure proper shoes and warm
clothing. Some of the most deserving of them will often
actually suffer before they will ask for assistance. We'll
look out for the expense some way.” He was, in fact, as
insistent that the students should have comforts as he was
that they should not have luxuries.</p>
          <p>His attention to details and the comfort of the students
was well illustrated in the close watch he kept over the
dining-rooms and kitchens which he inspected every day he
was on the grounds. Tomkins dining-hall is the largest
building on the Institute grounds and is one of the largest
dining-halls in America. It can seat over two thousand
persons at one time. Adjoining this hall is a spacious
dining-room for the teachers as well as extensive kitchens
and a bakery. Underneath it is a great assembly hall
which seats twenty-five hundred. Mr. Washington would
usually appear before breakfast to assure himself at first
hand that the stewards, matrons, and cooks were giving the
students warm, nourishing, and appetizing food upon which
to begin the day's work on the farm and in the shops and
classrooms. Nothing made him more indignant than to
find the coffee served lukewarm and the cereal watery or
the eggs stale. For such derelictions the guilty party was
promptly located and admonition or discharge followed
speedily. Probably in nothing was his instinct for putting
<pb id="washi228" n="228"/>
first things first better shown than in his insistence upon 
proper food, properly prepared and served for both students 
and teachers.</p>
          <p>He once said to his students, as previously quoted, “See to 
it that a certain ceremony, a certain importance, be 
attached to the partaking of food, etc. . . .” To carry out 
this idea each table in this great hall has a centrepiece of 
ferns, mosses, or flowers gathered from the woods by the 
student selected by his or her companions to decorate the 
table for that week. Boys and girls sit together at the 
tables. On Sundays and holidays first and second prizes are 
given for the tables most artistically decorated. Frequently 
these prizes take the form of some coveted delicacy in the 
way of food. Each day when at the Institute Mr. Washington 
would walk through the dining-hall during the noon meal and 
criticise these centrepieces, and things generally. He would 
point out that a certain decoration was too gaudy and 
profuse and had in it inharmonious colors. He would then 
remove the unnecessary parts and the discordant colors and 
point to the improved effect. He would next stop at a table 
with nothing in the way of decoration except a few scrawny 
flowers stuck carelessly into a vase. Picking up the meagre 
display he would say, “The boy or girl who did this is 
guilty of something far worse than bad taste, and that is 
laziness!” At the next table he would have a word of praise 
for the simple and artistic effect which they had produced 
with a centrepiece of wood mosses and red berries. These
comments would be interspersed with an occasional admonition
<pb id="washi229" n="229"/>
to this boy or that girl for a slovenly manner of eating, 
or an inquiry of a newcomer as to where he had come from and
whether he thought he was going to be happy in his new
surroundings. An oft-repeated cause of merriment was his
habit of stopping in the middle of the hall, calling for 
attention, and then asking the students if they were getting
enough of various articles which he would name, such as
sweet potatoes, corn, and blackberries. Cutting red tape
was one of his special delights. Sometimes he would 
discover, for instance, that certain vegetables were not 
being served because the steward had objected to the price
charged by the Farm Department. He would immediately
order these vegetables served and tell the protesting 
steward that he could fight it out with the Farm Department
while the students were enjoying the vegetables. From
the dining-room he would finally disappear into the
kitchens in his never-ceasing campaign for cleanliness.
Over and over again would he repeat to students, teachers,
and employees alike that the public would excuse them for
what they lacked in the way of buildings, equipment, and
even knowledge, but they would never be excused for 
shiftlessness, filth, litter, or disorder.</p>
          <p>One of the opportunities which he most highly prized and
one of his most effective means of influencing the whole
body of students was through his Sunday evening talks in
the Chapel. Over two thousand students, teachers,
teachers' families, and townspeople would crowd into the
Chapel to hear these talks. They were stenographically
reported and published in the school paper. In this way
<pb id="washi230" n="230"/>
he influenced not only the undergraduates, but a large
number of graduates and others who subscribed to the
paper largely for the purpose of following these talks. We
here quote from a previously unpublished (except in the
school paper) collection of these talks, delivered during the
school term of 1913-14, under the title of “What Parents
Would Like to Hear Concerning Students While at
School.” The first talk was called, “For Old and New
Students.” In it he said in part: “I suspect that each
one of your parents would like to know that you are 
learning to read your Bible; not only to read it because you
have to, but to read it every day in the year because you
have learned to love the Bible; because you have learned
day by day to make its teachings a part of you. . . .
Each one of you, in beginning your school year, should
have a Bible, and you should make that Bible a part of
your school life, a part of your very nature, and always, no
matter how busy the day may be, no matter how many 
mistakes, no matter how many failures you make in other 
directions, do not fail to find a few minutes to study or 
read your Bible.</p>
          <p>“The greatest people in the world, those who are most
learned; those who bear the burdens and responsibilities of
the world, are persons who are not ashamed to let the
world know not only that they believe in the Bible, but
that they read it.”</p>
          <p>And this was the advice of a man who never preached
what he did not practise and who only a few years 
before had been denounced by many of the preachers of
<pb id="washi231" n="231"/>
his own race as a Godless man, building up a Godless
school!</p>
          <p>A little further on he said: “In many cases you have
come from homes where there was no regular time for 
getting up in the morning, no regular time for eating your
meals, and no regular time for going to bed.</p>
          <p>“Now the basis of civilization is system, order, 
regularity. A race or an individual which has no fixed 
habits, no fixed place of abode, no time for going to bed, 
for getting up in the morning, for going to work; no 
arrangement, order, or system in all the ordinary business 
of life, such a race and such an individual are lacking in 
self-control, lacking in some of the fundamentals of 
civilization. . . .</p>
          <p>“If you take advantage of all these opportunities, if
your minds are so disposed that you can welcome and
make the most of these advantages, these habits of order
and system will soon be so fixed, so ingrained, so 
thoroughly a part of you that you will no longer tolerate 
disorder anywhere, that you will not be willing to endure
the old slovenly habits which so many of you brought
with you when you came here.”</p>
          <p>And later, in speaking of the haphazard, slipshod, 
irregular meal, he said: “Instead of bringing the family
together it has put them wider apart. A house in which
the family table is a mere lunch-counter is not and cannot
be a home.”</p>
          <p>And just before concluding this talk he said: “Now what
is true of this school is true of the world at large. This
is a little world of itself. It is a small sample of 
civilization,
<pb id="washi232" n="232"/>
an experiment station, so to speak, in which we are
trying to prepare you to live in a manner a little more
orderly, a little more efficient, and a little more civilized
than you have lived heretofore. If you are not able to
live and succeed here, you will not be able to live and
succeed in the world outside. If we do not want you
here, if we cannot get on with you here, it will mean that
the world outside will not want you, will not be able to
get on with you.”</p>
          <p>Probably no educator ever kept more constantly before
his own mind and before the minds of his students and
teachers that the purpose of education is preparation for
right living than did Booker Washington. Everything
that did not make for this end he eliminated, regardless
of customs and traditions, everything which did make
for this end he included, equally regardless of customs
and traditions.</p>
          <p>In a talk called, “Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother,”
the second of this series, he made this rather touching
statement: “Many of your parents are poor. Not only
that, but many of them are ignorant, at least, so far as
books are concerned. Notwithstanding all this, in every
case they have done something for you. It may have
been, in many cases I know that it has been, a very little,
but out of their poverty and out of their ignorance they
have done something. They have made it possible, in
the majority of cases, for you to come here, and no matter
how poor they are, no matter how ignorant they are, their
ambition is largely centred in you.”</p>
          <pb id="washi233" n="233"/>
          <p>This is one of the many statements which show that
Booker Washington had no illusions as to the ignorance
and poverty of the rank and file of his people, and yet with
this full knowledge and realization he never became 
discouraged.</p>
          <p>In another of these talks, on “The Importance of 
Simplicity,” he said: “In many cases young men in cities
do not own anything in the world except what they are
carrying around on their backs. They have a few collars
and a few cuffs, some bright-colored socks and neckties,
and that is all; nothing would be left of the man if you
were to bury these things. A few collars and cuffs, 
neckties, and a few pieces of cheap jewelry—that is 
all there is of such men.”</p>
          <p>Later in the same talk he said: “Short, simple, direct
sentences indicate education, indicate culture, indicate
common sense. Some people think the way for them to
show their education is by using big words, elaborate 
sentences, and by discussing subjects which nobody on earth
can understand.</p>
          <p>“Whenever you hear a man using words or talking on
a subject that you can't understand, you can be very
sure that the man does not understand himself what he is
trying to talk about. If a man is talking about any 
subject, literary or what not, of which he is really master,
he will be so direct, so simple, so perfectly clear and 
intelligible in the discussion of that subject that the most
humble person can understand what he is saying.”</p>
          <p>In a talk on “Being Polite,” he said: “It is often 
<pb id="washi234" n="234"/>
difficult, I might better say, it is always difficult, for 
persons to have genuine politeness in their hearts when they 
live in a country that is inhabited by different races. Here
in the South, and throughout this country, for that
matter, we come into contact with persons of another
race, persons of another color. It takes some effort, some
training, and often some determination to say, in dealing
with a person of another race, of another color, I will be
polite; I will be kind; I will be considerate.”</p>
          <p>In a talk on “Being Economical,” he said: “You will
help yourself and help this school if you will say to 
yourself constantly: ‘This is my home; this property does not
belong exclusively to the Trustees, but it is mine; I am a
trustee, every student is a trustee of this institution.
How can I make every dollar go as far as possible? How
can I help cut down expenses here?’” And later on, “I
want you to get into the habit of saying: ‘This institution
belongs to me, belongs to my race; every dollar that is
spent here is spent for my benefit and for the benefit of my
race; every cent that is wasted here is my loss and the
loss of all the generations that come after me.’”</p>
          <p>In a talk on “The Use of Time,” he said: “You hear
people speaking sometimes about ‘killing time.’ No
civilized man should be allowed to kill time any more than
he should be allowed to destroy any of the other natural
resources. When you find a man engaged in ‘killing time’
you will find a man who is disobeying one of the most
fundamental laws of civilization. A man who habitually 
devotes himself to ‘killing time’ is a dangerous
<pb id="washi235" n="235"/>
citizen and the law against vagrancy is aimed against
him.</p>
          <p>In a talk on “Being All Right, But,” he said: “You
frequently hear it said of certain persons in one connection
or another that ‘they are all right, except,’ or ‘they are
all right, but.’ You are thinking, perhaps, of employing
some one for this or that important service and among
others the question is asked: ‘What kind of disposition
has this one or that one?’ Very often you receive an
answer something like this: ‘They are all right, but——’
That ‘but’ carries with it a lot of things. There are too
many people in the world who are ‘all right, but.’ We
want to get rid of just as many of these ‘buts’ as we
can.” And in concluding the same talk he said: “Think
big thoughts, think about big questions, read big books,
and, most of all, get into contact with the big people of
your acquaintance and get out from under the control
of the little people of your acquaintance. If you will do
this, gradually you will find yourself better fitted for life;
you will find yourself happier and better fitted to render
service. . . .”</p>
          <p>In a talk on “The Power of Persistence,” he said: 
“Always keep your eye on the student who seems to be dull,
who is slow in his studies, who has to repeat his class, but
who keeps plodding along doggedly, determinedly, until he
has finished the course of study.</p>
          <p>“Keep your eye on that student after he has gone out
into the world. He has learned to endure, he has learned
to stick to his job in season and out of season. . . .”</p>
          <pb id="washi236" n="236"/>
          <p>In a talk on “Standing Still,” he said: “People say of
us that, as a race, we are not capable of going very far,
not capable of making steady, persistent progress. We
go a little way and there we stop, stand still, and stagnate.
. . . Now one of the things which this school aims
to do for you and through you is to change, as far as
possible, the reputation of our people in so far as they are
regarded as unprogressive, lacking in initiative and in
ability to go forward unwaveringly.”</p>
          <p>The concluding talk of this series, and perhaps the
strongest of them all, was entitled, “Thou Shalt Not Steal.”
In it he said: “I believe if you could get down into the
deep, dark corners of your own hearts, and if you could
get deep down into the hearts of your parents, you could
find there, in both cases, a misgiving, a sense of danger,
never clearly expressed but always present, a fear that
some time, somewhere, trouble was in store for you and
for them.</p>
          <p>“This is so far true, in some cases of which I know, that
if parents should some day learn that their children were
in trouble they would not be surprised, because they have
expected it, looked forward to it, and feared it; because
they have known and suspected all along that you had
never thoroughly learned to control yourself when 
dealing with other people's property. . . .”</p>
          <p>Later on he added: “This disposition to pilfer was, to
a large extent, a part of the history of slavery. It was
rare when colored people who belonged to a white family
where they served as cooks, butlers, or in some other form
<pb id="washi237" n="237"/>
of household service, did not feel that everything belonging
to the white family belonged equally to them. Thus,
when freedom came, it was difficult to get the colored
cook to feel that she was a mere employee, that in the
wages she received by the week or month she was being
paid for her services for cooking. It was very hard to
get her away from the customs and practises of slavery,
especially when receiving very small wages.</p>
          <p>“In many cases boys and girls have seen or have known
that their mothers kept up this practice of pilfering from
persons for whom they cooked. They have seen it going
on day after day and year after year in their own homes
and have observed that employers seem to expect it, wink
at it, at any rate, put up with it. While they know, as
their parents know, that it is wrong, they have nevertheless
come to feel that it is one of the ways in which black
folk and white folk get on together; one of the indirect
ways, in other words, in which black people have learned
to recompense themselves for disadvantages which they
suffer in other directions.”</p>
          <p>In conclusion he said: “Each one of you can do 
something toward solving the race problem, for example, by
making, each for himself, a reputation for honesty in the
community in which you live. If in the part of the 
country where you now live members of our race have a 
reputation for carelessness, looseness in regard to the 
ownership of property, you can help to solve the race 
problem, and make life here in the South more comfortable 
for every other member of the race if you will win for 
yourself
<pb id="washi238" n="238"/>
a reputation for downright honesty and integrity in
all your dealings with your neighbors, whether they be
white or black.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Washington once said, “In all my teaching I have
watched carefully the influence of the toothbrush, and
I am convinced that there are few single agencies of 
civilization that are more far-reaching.” He made periodic
tours of the students' rooms to find out what students if
any were without toothbrushes. The possession and
use of a toothbrush is one of the entrance requirements
for Tuskegee. In this connection he used to tell with a
chuckle the reply of the girl who in answer to his question
as to whose toothbrush he found on the washstand said,
”That is ours,” referring to her roommate and herself.</p>
          <p>In his tours of inspection of the students' rooms he
would also inquire how many nightgowns they owned.
He insisted that every student should have at least two
nightgowns. He was constantly impressing upon the
students that decent, respectable people do not sleep in
the garments in which they work during the day. In
fact, he preached the gospel of the nightgown and the
toothbrush as insistently as he did the gospel of work
and simplicity.</p>
          <p>He constantly insisted that the welfare of the students
should be at all times the dominant consideration in the
conduct of the institution. When the teachers would
sometimes complain that their welfare was not sufficiently
considered he would remind them that the Institute was
being conducted for the benefit of the students and that
<figure id="ill10" entity="wash238"><p>The cosmopolitan character of the Tuskegee 
student body is shown by the fact that during the
past year students have come from the foreign
countries or colonies of foreign countries 
indicated by the various flags shown in this 
picture</p></figure>
<pb id="washi239" n="239"/>
teachers were not required except for the benefit of the
students. That the students should be happy was 
almost a mania with him. He was constantly sending
for officers and teachers to inquire as to whether the
students seemed happy.</p>
          <p>To the delight of the students he would occasionally call
a mass-meeting where he would call upon them one by
one to get up and tell him of anything that was wrong, of
anything that was keeping them from being as happy as
he wanted them to be. It was understood that everything 
that a student said in such a meeting would be 
regarded as a confidence and that nothing that he said
would be used against him. The teachers sometimes 
protested against the unbridled criticism which Mr. 
Washington permitted in these meetings. He, however, 
continued them without modification, and while many of
the students' complaints were grossly exaggerated their
statements nevertheless led to reforms in some important
particulars. The meetings undoubtedly added greatly to
the contentment and happiness of the student body.</p>
          <p>He was always trying to protect the poorer students
against the danger of being embarrassed or humiliated
by the more fortunate ones. In this connection he was
constantly resisting the importunities of students and
teachers who wanted to charge admission fees to this or
that game or entertainment. When the occasion really
demanded and justified an admission fee he would make
secret arrangements with the management to have the
poorer students admitted at his personal expense.</p>
          <pb id="washi240" n="240"/>
          <p>His willingness to hear the students' grievances was a
characteristic not always appreciated by the officers and
teachers. He was a firm believer in the right of petition 
either for a group or an individual. No matter how pressed 
and driven he was with business no student or group of 
students, and no teacher or group of teachers, was too 
humble or obscure in the school's life to win a personal 
hearing. He would without hesitation reopen and 
painstakingly review a case, already decided by the 
Executive Council, if he thought there was the slightest 
chance that an injustice had been done. He insisted upon 
giving the accused not only“a square deal,” but the benefit
of every doubt. On the other hand, when there was no 
reasonable doubt of guilt no one could be more stern and
unrelenting than he in meting out justice.</p>
          <p>Mr. Washington always encouraged and helped every
ambitious student who came to Tuskegee to develop his
capacities to the utmost no matter whether they were large or
small. Years ago a student, William Sidney Pittman, showed a
particular aptitude for carpentry and draftsmanship. After
working his way through Tuskegee he was very anxious to
take a course in architecture. Mr. Washington arranged to
have the Institute advance him the money for a three years'
course at the Drexel Institute of Philadelphia, on the
understanding that he would return to Tuskegee as a teacher
after his graduation and from his earnings pay back to the
school all that had been advanced for his training at Drexel.
Pittman's record at Drexel was wholly satisfactory. He
returned to Tuskegee
<pb id="washi241" n="241"/>
and repaid his loan in accordance with the agreement.
He has since won the competitive award for the design of
the Negro Building at the Jamestown Exposition, has
built a large number of public and semi-public buildings
throughout the South, including the Carnegie Library at
Houston, Texas; a Pythian Temple at Dallas, Texas,
where he lives, for the Negro members of the Knights of
Pythias; the Collis P. Huntington Memorial Building at
Tuskegee, and a number of Young Men's Christian 
Association buildings for colored men. In 1907 he married
Mr. Washington's only daughter, Portia Marshall 
Washington, after her graduation from Bradford Academy,
Massachusetts. He is now generally regarded as the
foremost architect of his race.</p>
          <p>Somewhat later Mr. Washington succeeded in securing
some scholarships which enabled promising Tuskegee
graduates to take two years of post-graduate work in
teaching methods at the Teachers' College of Columbia
University. These scholarships were given by John
Crosby Brown, V. Everett Macy, and John D. Rockefeller,
Jr. In each case these students were required to return
to Tuskegee as teachers for two years—the same time as
their course at Columbia. Dean Russell of the Teachers'
College has testified to the earnestness and high character
of these Tuskegee graduates.</p>
          <p>As measured by the Tuskegee standard of success, which
is service to others, perhaps the most successful of all
Tuskegee's graduates is William H. Holtzclaw, the 
Principal of the Utica Normal and Industrial Institute of
<pb id="washi242" n="242"/>
Mississippi. There is no school that has better emulated
the best there is in Tuskegee Institute, and there is no
graduate of Tuskegee that has followed more faithfully
and effectively in Booker Washington's footsteps. 
Holtzclaw has told his own story in an admirably written and
most interesting book entitled,“The Black Man's 
Burden.” Starting in 1903 with a capital of seventy-five
cents, no land and no buildings in a little one-room,
ramshackle log cabin, which he did not own and in which
he and his wife lived as well as taught, Holtzclaw now has
an annual enrollment of nearly five hundred students
and a faculty of thirty teachers. The school through its
varied forms of extension work influences yearly about
thirty thousand people. It owns seventeen hundred acres
of land and conducts twenty different industries aside
from its academic work. The buildings and property
are valued at one hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
It has also its own electric light plant and water-works and
an endowment of over thirty-two thousand dollars. In
concluding his book Mr. Holtzclaw says:“I see more
clearly than ever before the great task that is before me,
and I propose to continue the struggle. It is an appalling
task: a State with more than a million Negroes to be 
educated, with half a million children of school age, 35
per cent. of whom at the present time attend no school
at all (only 36 per cent. in average attendance), a
State whose dual school system makes it impossible
to furnish more than a mere pittance for the education of
each child—yet these children must be educated, must be
<pb id="washi243" n="243"/>
unfettered, set free. That freedom for which Christian
men and women, North and South, have worked and
prayed so long must be realized in the lives of these young
people. This, then, is my task, the war that I must wage;
and I propose to stay on the firing-line and fight the good
fight of faith.”</p>
          <p>Another Tuskegee graduate in whom Mr. Washington
was especially interested is Isaac Fisher. Fisher has
been awarded the following prizes for his writings:</p>
          <p>“What We've Learned About the Rum Question,”
$500; “German and American Methods of Regulating
Trusts,” $400 (in order to write this paper Mr. Fisher
had to acquire a reading knowledge of German which he
did alone and unaided in a few months' <sic corr="time)">time</sic>; “Ten of the
Best Reasons Why People Should Live in Missouri,”
$100; “A Plan to Give the South a System of Highways
Suited to Its Needs, $100; “The Most Practicable Method
of Beginning a Tariff Reduction,” honorable mention.
(Upon the request of the chief examiner of the United
States Tariff Board this essay was sent to that body for
its use.) Besides these, Mr. Fisher has taken several
minor prizes for compositions on various subjects.</p>
          <p>It would be difficult to say, however, whether Booker
Washington showed greater interest in the most brilliant
or the most backward students. Certain it is that the
most backward students won his special attention and
encouragement.</p>
          <p>In the early days of the school there was a student by
the name of Jailous Perdue whom Mr. Washington 
<pb id="washi244" n="244"/>
constantly encouraged and in whom he never lost faith in
spite of his almost total failure to master his classroom
work. Monroe N. Work, the statistician of the Institute
and the editor of “The Negro Year Book,” under the title
“The Man Who Failed,” has thus told Perdue's story:</p>
          <p>“Back in the days when the cooking for students at
Tuskegee was done out of doors in pots and the principal
entrance requirement was a ‘desire to make something
of himself’ a young man, Jailous Perdue, came to 
Tuskegee to get an education. He was financially poor and
intellectually dull. Examinations he could not pass.
After struggling along for several years and accumulating
a lot of examination failures, he decided to quit school, go
out to work and help educate his sisters. Although he
had failed in his literary subjects, he had nevertheless got
an education in how to use his hands. He had learned
to be a carpenter. Out in the world he went and began
to work at his trade. As soon as he had earned a little
money he placed three of his sisters in school at Tuskegee,
and with the help of his brother Augustus, who had
graduated some time before, supported two of them there
for three years and one for four years.</p>
          <p>“In the meantime he had succeeded at his trade and
gone into business for himself at Montgomery, Ala., as
a contractor and builder. Here also he was successful
and did thousands of dollars' worth of work. No job
was too small nor too large for him to make a bid on.
If he did not have a contract of his own he was not above
working for some other contractor, and as a result he was
<pb id="washi245" n="245"/>
always busy. He has superintended the construction of some
of the largest buildings in Montgomery. Among the buildings
the erection of which he has superintended are the Exchange
Hotel, at a cost of $150,000; the First Baptist Church, at 
a cost of $175,000; the First National Bank Building, at a 
cost of $350,000; and the Bell Building, at a cost of 
$450,000. Perdue also assisted as foreman or assistant 
foreman in erecting many of the important buildings at 
Tuskegee Institute, such as the Principal's house, the 
chapel, the library, Rockefeller Hall, the Academic 
Building, and the Millbank Agricultural Building. </p>
          <p>“It is hardly necessary to say that Mr. Perdue has
accumulated property or that he owns a good home in
Montgomery, for in these progressive days every black man in
the South with any foresight is investing some part of his
earnings in property. The most interesting and somewhat
remarkable thing about the career of Perdue and the greatest
measure of his success is that twenty-three years after he 
had left Tuskegee a literary failure he was asked to come 
back and become a member of the faculty as an instructor in
carpentry. Thus it was that the man who failed succeeded and
returned to the scene of his failure a success. Perdue was
constantly encouraged by Mr. Washington. He came under
the type of those who were not brilliant, but who were always
in his opinion worthy of help and encouragement.”</p>
          <p>Washington A. Tate was even duller in books than Perdue.
During his early years at Tuskegee he seemed 
<pb id="washi246" n="246"/>
unable to grasp the most rudimentary information. His
native dullness was made unpleasant and aggressive by a
combative disposition. He was constantly trying to prove
to his exasperated teachers that he knew what he did not
know. He was almost twenty-five years of age when he
reached the Institute and entered the lowest primary
grade. He had the greatest difficulty in passing any
examinations and never succeeded in passing all that were
required. Motions were constantly made and passed
in faculty meetings to drop Tate, and were as constantly
vetoed by Mr. Washington on the plea of giving him one
more chance. Finally when Tate's time to graduate
came the teachers in a body protested against giving him
a diploma. Mr. Washington argued that a man who had
made all the sacrifices Tate had made at his age to stay
in school, a man who had worked early and late in fair
weather and foul for the school, a man who had stuck to
his task in the face of repeated failures and 
discouragements, had in him something better than the mere 
ability to pass examinations. Through Mr. Washington's 
intercession for him Tate got his diploma. The next day Mr.
Washington had him employed to take charge of the
school's piggery. Because of his hard, conscientious,
and effective work in this capacity he was afterward
recommended to the United States Department of 
Agriculture at Washington as the proper man to take charge
of the United States demonstration work in Macon
County, Ala. Tate proved to be one of the Government's 
most successful demonstration agents. He is
<pb id="washi247" n="247"/>
now farming successfully on his own account in an 
adjoining county.</p>
          <p>Booker Washington, as previously pointed out, saw
very much more clearly than most educators that education's 
only purpose and sole justification lies in preparation 
for right living. A man who has passed all manner of
examinations may not be prepared to live rightly and hence
may not justly claim to be educated. A man who has
failed to pass examinations may be prepared for right
living and hence may justly be called an educated man.
In other words, Booker Washington realized that education
was primarily a matter of the development of character
and only secondarily a matter of the acquisition of 
information.</p>

          <pb id="washi248" n="248"/>
          <head>CHAPTER TEN</head>
          <head>RAISING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS A YEAR</head>
          <p>DURING recent years the expenses of Tuskegee Institute 
have run to between $200,000 and $300,000 a year.
Of this sum Booker Washington had to raise over $100,000
annually aside from the large sums constantly demanded
for new equipment such as the great central heating and
power plant which was installed in 1915 at a cost of more
than $245,000.</p>
          <p>At the ceremonies commemorating the twenty-fifth
anniversary of the founding of Tuskegee Institute President 
Charles W. Eliot of Harvard was one of the speakers.
He said that one of his “first impressions of Tuskegee
Institute,” after just a glimpse, was “that the oldest and
now largest American Institution of learning was more
than 200 years arriving at the possession of much less
land, fewer buildings, and a smaller quick capital than
Tuskegee had come to possess in twenty-five <sic corr="years.&quot;">years.</sic>
“That's just a fact,” he said, “Harvard University was
not as rich after living two hundred years among the
people of Massachusetts as Tuskegee is to-day, after
having lived twenty-five years among the people of 
Alabama. And that's the first impression that I have 
received here.</p>
          <p>
            <figure id="ill11" entity="wash248">
              <p>In 1906, the Tuskegee Institute celebrated its 25th
Anniversary. In the group above appear such well-known American characters as Dr. William J. Schieffelin, New York; Dr. H. B. Frissell, Hampton Institute, Va.; J. G. Phelps Stokes, philanthropist, New York; Isaac N. Seligman, banker, New York; Dr. Lyman Abbott, editor of the <hi rend="italics">Outlook</hi>; Dr. Wallace Buttrick, Secretary General Education Board; William G. Willcox, now President of the New York Board of Education; Robert C. Ogden, philanthropist, New York; Andrew Carnegie, and Miss Clara Spence of the Spence School, with numbers of their friends</p>
            </figure>
          </p>
          <pb id="washi249" n="249"/>
          <p>“This evening I have received another impression from your
Principal. He said that the great need of Tuskegee, to-day,
was a considerable sum of money, which could be used at the
discretion of the Trustees, to fill gaps, to make 
improvements, and to enlarge and strengthen the different 
branches of the institution. Now I should not find it 
possible to state in more precise terms the present needs 
of Harvard University. The needs of these two institutions, 
situated, to be sure, in very different communities, and 
founded on very different dates, are precisely the same.” 
This comparison is the more striking when we realize that 
President Eliot had at the time been at the head of Harvard 
University for thirty years, five years longer than Tuskegee 
had been in existence—President Eliot of whom it was 
said, “When he goes to rich men they just throw up their 
hands and say, ‘Don't shoot! How much do you want?’”</p>
          <p>The magnitude of Booker Washington's financial task is
indicated in his last annual report which he made to his
Trustees in 1915. He reported:</p>
          <p>“As of May 31st, we have received from all sources for
current expenses $268,825.17; for buildings and improvements,
$28,919.47; for endowment, $28,102.09; from undesignated
legacies, $53,858.10, making the total receipts for the 
purposes named for the year $379,704,83.</p>
          <p>“The gifts to the Endowment Fund for the year amounting
to $28,102.09 now make the Fund stand at $1,970,214.17</p>
          <p>“The budget recommended for your consideration for
<pb id="washi250" n="250"/>
the new year calls for an expenditure for current expenses,
repairs, renewals, and equipment of $291,567.92. . . .”</p>
          <p>Later in the report he said: “Notwithstanding the depressed
financial condition of a large part of the country, I feel 
it would be a great mistake for us in any degree to slacken 
our efforts to keep the school before the public or to get 
funds. I believe, as Dr. H. B. Frissell, Principal of the 
Hampton Institute, has often expressed it, that a large part 
of the mission of both Hampton and Tuskegee is to keep the 
cause of Negro education before the country, and that the 
benefits coming from such efforts of publicity do not 
confine themselves alone to Hampton and Tuskegee, but benefit 
all the schools in the South. With this end in view, I very 
much hope that the Trustees may see their way clear to 
encourage and help us as far as possible in holding a number 
of large public meetings during the coming year.” These were 
brave words for a dying man. Five months later he died of 
sheer exhaustion shortly after addressing one of these 
“large public meetings.” They also show the breadth of his 
conception of his task. You will note that he points out 
that such publicity as he urges, “benefits all the schools 
in the South”—not merely the schools for Negroes, but 
“all the schools.” It never occurred to him to limit his 
sense of responsibility to his own school nor even to the
schools for his own race. As previously mentioned he would
sometimes devote an entire public address to an appeal for
more and better schools for the poor whites of the South.</p>
          <p>Booker Washington's money-raising efforts consumed
<pb id="washi251" n="251"/>
two-thirds of his time and perhaps even more of his
strength and energy. He planned these money-raising
campaigns just as carefully as a good general plans a
military campaign. His last big money-raising campaign
was conducted during June, 1915. He and the Trustees
of the Institute had been engaged for two or three years
in the effort to raise the money to complete the cost of
the central power and heating plant, but nearly $100,000
of the $245,000 needed had not been raised. This burden
bore heavily upon him. At last, with the approval of
the Trustees, he decided to make one last herculean effort
not only to raise this huge sum, but in addition, the money
necessary to end the school year free of debt. For this
purpose he formulated a plan of campaign by which five
representatives of the school should cover the chief centres
of population throughout the Northern and Middle Western 
States. This was the outline of the territorial assignments 
of the collectors:</p>
          <p>Mr. Chislom: New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts
—important centre—Boston.</p>
          <p>Mr. Wood: Rhode Island, New York east of Syracuse,
and Binghamton, Connecticut—important centre—New
York City.</p>
          <p>Mr. Thomas: New York, west of Syracuse and Binghamton, 
Pennsylvania—important centre—Philadelphia.</p>
          <p>Mr. Stevenson: Illinois, Wisconsin—important centre—
Chicago.</p>
          <p>Mr. Powell: Michigan, Ohio—important centres—
Detroit and Cleveland.</p>
          <pb id="washi252" n="252"/>
          <p>Each representative carried letters of introduction to
leading men and women in the various centres throughout 
his territory. All these letters were personally signed
by Mr. Washington. At the close of each day each
collector telegraphed Mr. Washington at Tuskegee giving
the amount of subscriptions and pledges he had secured
that day. The next morning Mr. Washington wired each
collector, stating the total amount of gifts and pledges
secured by all five collectors. When the Trustees met
in New York City, on the last Thursday of June, 1915,
all but four or five thousand dollars of the over $245,000
had been raised.</p>
          <p>The Trustees themselves made up the difference by
increasing by this amount their own subscriptions. Thus
was successfully concluded the last great and difficult
task which Booker Washington was to be permitted to
perform.</p>
          <p>Of the hundreds of invitations to speak here, there, and
everywhere which kept pouring in upon him certain ones
he definitely accepted because of the money-raising 
opportunities either direct or indirect which they offered; 
others of less promise he tentatively accepted to fall back 
upon in case the more desirable ones for any reason 
miscarried. Chautauqua engagements he considered only where 
they provided an opportunity for direct appeal for 
contributions for the work, or at least the chance to 
distribute printed matter. Chautauqua bureaus offering him as
much as half the gate receipts above $500 in addition to a
guarantee of $300 a night he turned down out of hand if
<pb id="washi253" n="253"/>
they did not include one or both of these opportunities.
No matter how much money they offered he would never
accept such propositions unless they carried with them
some opportunity to make a direct appeal for his work.
It was sometimes suggested to him that he might receive
these fees personally and then turn them over to the
school. This he declined to do because he was unwilling
to give even the appearance of capitalizing his reputation
and oratorical gifts for his personal enrichment. Booker
Washington was not one of those simple-hearted 
individuals who are guided solely by what they deem 
inherently right. He always strove to avoid the appearance 
of evil as well as the evil itself; and, with one unhappy
exception, he always succeeded. He fully realized that
his conduct was under constant scrutiny by enemies
in both races eager to find some pretext to drag him down.
So circumspect was he in his behavior that once only
between the time he became a national character in 1895
until his death twenty years later did his critics succeed
in distorting any deed of his into the semblance of 
misconduct. The very nature of the charge in this one 
instance was sufficient refutation for any person acquainted
in even the slightest degree with the man's life, work,
or character.</p>
          <p>The press as well as the platform he constantly used
to keep his work before the public for money-raising 
purposes. He had as good a “nose for a story” as the best of
reporters, and every story that came his way was sure to
find its way into print. No matter how driven with
<pb id="washi254" n="254"/>
pressing matters nor how tired he never denied himself to
“the newspaper boys.” He believed that the more
prominence, the more “limelight,” he could secure the
better, provided he used it for the promotion of his work.
Thus he presented the apparent anomaly of being at the
same time one of the most modest and unassuming of men
and also one of the greatest advertisers of his day.</p>
          <p>As well as the general press of both races he constantly
used the school press for money-raising purposes. The
school paper which circulates among donors and 
prospective donors as well as among the students, teachers,
and graduates carries in each issue brief statements of
some immediate and pressing needs and the money 
required to satisfy them. These needs are set forth in the
following manner:</p>

work and publicity work has been greatly hindered and

but at the same time could be used as a means of teaching

a foundry, and a veterinary hospital were similarly 
presented. The funds to meet each of these needs were 
received as a result of these appeals, and a new list of 
needs is now being advertised.</p>
          <p>In concluding his annual report each year Mr. 
Washington would summarize the immediate needs of the
institution. In his last report he thus stated them:</p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item>1. $50 a year for annual scholarships for tuition for
one student, the student himself providing for his own

          <p>A few months later, as he lay dying in a New York
hospital, the following letter was received for him at
Tuskegee. It was at once forwarded and passed him on
his last journey to his home in the South. He never saw
it. The donor, a Northern friend who withholds his name,
has renewed the offer to the Trustees and they have 
accepted it.</p>

                  <p>DEAR MR. WASHINGTON: I have read your annual
report and also your treasurer's report, and make you the
following proposition: If you will raise enough money to
pay all of your debts up to May 1, 1916, and add two
hundred and fifty thousand dollars to your endowment
fund, I will give you the sum of two hundred and fifty
thousand dollars for your building fund, to be used in
building the items such as Nos. 4, 6, 7, 8, and the “Barnes,
etc.,” mentioned under the head of “Special Needs,” and
for objects of similar character. The above does not
include item No. 5, “Building for religious purposes,”
as I am not interested in that sort of work. I shall be
glad to know whether this proposition interests you.</p>

          <p>The interest of this giver was first <hi rend="italics">aroused</hi> by his reading
“Up from Slavery” when it appeared in book form in
1901. As soon as he had read the book he sent Dr. 
<pb id="washi257" n="257"/>
Washington a check for $10,000 for his work which he has 
renewed each year since until he made the above offer. “Up 
from Slavery” has brought more money to Tuskegee than all the
other books, articles, speeches, and circulars written by Mr.
Washington himself and the many others who have written or
spoken about him and his work. Among its larger immediate
results, aside from awakening the interest of the anonymous
giver already mentioned, was its similar effect upon the 
late H. H. Rogers, Vice-President and active head at the 
time of the Standard Oil Company, and upon Andrew Carnegie. 
Mr. Rogers became so much interested that he not only gave 
large sums for the general needs of Tuskegee but eventually
financed a large part of the rural school extension work, 
which has been described in earlier chapters, and which is 
now so important a part of the school's activities. Under 
Booker Washington's inspiration and guidance, too, Mr. 
Rogers later combined railroad building with race building. 
In building his Virginia railroad he undertook a 
wide-reaching work in agricultural education among the Negro 
farmers living within carting distance of his road. Booker 
Washington had demonstrated to his satisfaction that by 
increasing at the same time their wants and their ability to 
gratify their wants he would be building up business for 
his railroad.</p>
          <p>Shortly after the publication in 1901 of “Up from Slavery,”
Frank N. Doubleday, of Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., the
publishers of the book, in playing golf with Mr. Carnegie
mentioned Booker Washington and told him
<pb id="washi258" n="258"/>
something of his life. Mr. Carnegie was interested and
wanted to know more. Mr. Doubleday gave him a copy
of “Up from Slavery.” After reading the book he 
immediately got into communication with the author, told
him of his interest in his life and work, and of his desire 
to help him. The result was that Mr. Carnegie agreed to
pay for the construction and equipment of a library to
be built by the students. Booker Washington, his
Executive Council, and the school's architect, spent hours
and hours of time in scrutinizing every detail to bring the
cost down to the smallest possible figure consistent with
an adequate result. The final cost to Mr. Carnegie
was only $15,000. Mr. Carnegie was amazed that so
large, convenient, and dignified a building could be built
at so small a cost. Over and over again both to
Mr. Washington and to friends of the school he 
expressed his surprise and pleasure at the result obtained
by this relatively small expenditure. After that there
was no doubt he would do more for the school. It was
simply a question of how much more and what form it
would take. In 1903 the following letter was received by
the late William H. Baldwin, Jr., in his capacity as 
president of the Tuskegee Board of Trustees.</p>

                  <p>My DEAR MR. BALDWIN: I have instructed Mr. Franks,
Secretary, to deliver to you as Trustee of Tuskegee
<pb id="washi259" n="259"/>
$600,000 of 5 per cent. U. S. Steel Company bonds to
complete the Endowment Fund as per circular.</p>
                  <p>One condition only—the revenue of one hundred and fifty
thousand of these bonds is to be subject to Booker
Washington's order to be used by him first for his wants and
those of his family during his life or the life of his widow
—if any surplus is left he can use it for Tuskegee. I 
wish that great and good man to be free from pecuniary 
cares that he may devote himself wholly to his great Mission.</p>
                  <p>To me he seems one of the foremost of living men because
his work is unique. The Modern Moses, who leads his race
and lifts it through Education to even better and higher 
things than a land overflowing with milk and honey—
History is to know two Washingtons, one white, the other 
black, both Fathers of their people. I am satisfied that 
the serious race question of the South is to be solved 
wisely only by following Booker Washington's policy which 
he seems to have been specially born—a slave among 
slaves—to establish, and even in his own day, greatly to 
advance.</p>
                  <p>So glad to be able to assist this good work in which you and
others are engaged.</p>

          <p>This great gift delighted Booker Washington not only for
what it meant directly to his work, but because it so 
strikingly illustrated a truth which he had long and 
insistently impressed upon his staff and his students: 
namely, that if every dollar contributed were made to do
<pb id="washi260" n="260"/>
the work of two, more dollars would be forthcoming from the
same source.</p>
          <p>The two events upon which Booker Washington's popular
fame chiefly rests are his speech before the Cotton States
Exposition in Atlanta, Ga., in 1895, and the publication of 
“Up from Slavery” five years later. Since “Up from Slavery” 
played so great a part in aiding its author to secure funds 
for his work it seems appropriate to give here some account 
of how it came to be written, how it was written, and how 
it was received.</p>
          <p>In the year 1900 the editors of the <hi rend="italics">Outlook</hi> decided to
illustrate in the concrete the opportunities of America by
getting some of the Americans of greatest achievement to tell
how they had risen by their own efforts from the very depths
of untoward circumstances. For this purpose they selected
Jacob A Riis and Booker T. Washington. After much
hesitancy on his part and urgency on theirs Booker
Washington finally agreed to write the story of his life for
serial publication in the <hi rend="italics">Outlook</hi>. His hesitancy was due
merely to the fact that he could not believe that the 
events of his life would be of any interest to the public. 
So convinced was he in this belief that he had the greatest 
difficulty in starting to write even after he had agreed to 
do so. Finally, after a particularly urgent letter from the 
editors, he stole some hours from his absorbing and exacting 
duties at Tuskegee to write the first chapter. After these 
efforts had been typewritten by his stenographer they 
produced only three and one-half pages—an amount of copy 
discouragingly inadequate for the first installment. He 
<pb id="washi261" n="261"/>
mailed the material, however, with a line of apology for its
inadequacy and promising to send more the next day. On
receipt of this scant initial copy the editors wrote him a
letter of congratulation and approval which greatly 
encouraged him, in spite of his heavy and unrelenting 
administrative duties, to push ahead with new courage.
Notwithstanding, however, the best intentions on the part
of the writer and the most patiently insistent reminders on
the part of the editors there were many and wide gaps in
the supposedly consecutive series of chapters before the
story was finally finished. Much of the story he dragged
from his tired brain, and jotted down on odds and ends of
paper on trains, while waiting in railway stations, in hotels,
and in ten and fifteen minute intervals snatched from 
overburdened days in his office. The fact that it was a
physical impossibility to give adequate time and attention
to so important a piece of work distressed him and made
him feel even more apologetic about the product.</p>
          <p>The enthusiastic reception of his story by the editors and
later by the public was accordingly particularly surprising
and gratifying to him. After its serial publication he was
soon almost overwhelmed with congratulatory letters and
laudatory reviews. Julian Ralph in the New York <hi rend="italics">Mail</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">Express</hi> wrote in part:</p>
          <p>“It does not matter if the reader feels a prejudice against
the Negro, or if he be a Negrophile, or if he has never
cared one way or the other whether the Negro does or does
not exist. Whatever be his feelings, ‘Up from Slavery’ is
as remarkable as the most important book ever written by
<pb id="washi262" n="262"/>
an American. That book is ‘Uncle Tom's Cabin.’
Booker Washington's story is its echo and its antithesis.
‘Uncle Tom's Cabin’ was the wail of a fettered, 
hope-forsaken race. ‘Up from Slavery’ is the triumphant cry of
the same race, led by its Moses upon a trail which leads to
an intelligent use of the freedom that came to it as an 
almost direct result of Mrs. Stowe's revolutionary novel.
‘Up from Slavery’ and ‘Uncle Tom's Cabin’ are inseparably 
linked in the history of our relations with our dark-skinned 
fellow-citizen. One book begins precisely where
the other left off.”</p>
          <p>William Dean Howells in the <hi rend="italics">North American Review</hi>
said of it: “. . . What strikes you first and last is
his constant common sense. He has lived heroic poetry,
and he can, therefore, afford to talk simple prose. . . .
The mild might of his adroit, his subtle statesmanship (in
the highest sense it is not less than statesmanship, and 
involves a more Philippine problem in our midst), is the only
agency to which it can yield. . . .”</p>
          <p>Among the congratulatory letters came one from Athens,
Greece, signed “Bob Burdette, Mrs. Burdette, and the
children” which greatly amused and delighted Mr. 
Washington. It reads, paraphrasing the passage in the book
where he tells of the insistent stranger who unerringly seeks
him out when he tries to get a little quiet and rest on a
train, “‘Is not this Booker T. Washington? We wish to
introduce ourselves.’ You see, you can't escape it. We
read that sentence, and shouted with delight over it, in
Damascus. I was going to write—‘far-away Damascus’
<pb id="washi263" n="263"/>
—but no place is far away now. Damascus is very near to
Tuskegee, in fact, only six or seven thousand years older, and
not more than fifty thousand years behind. It must have had a
good start, too, for Abraham went there or sent there to get
that wise and tactful ‘steward of his house’ Eliezir. But 
Damascus has always remained in the same place, whereas 
Tuskegee has been marching on by leaps and bounds. But you 
are a busy man—we have heard that, even in this land. 
And I can see you reading this letter five lines at a
time. No use sitting next the window, piling your 
hand-baggage up in the seat, and pulling your hat over your 
eyes, is there? No, for we come along just the same, sit on 
the arm of the seat, touch your elbow, and —‘Is not this 
Booker T. Washington?’ We have been travelling for a year. 
The <hi rend="italics">Outlook</hi> has followed us week by week. And week by week
we have reached out to clasp your hand, and have knelt to
thank God for the story of your life—for its 
inspiration, its hopefulness, its trust, its fidelity to 
duty and purpose. Such a wonderful story, told in the 
elegance of simplicity that only a great heart can feel and 
write. We paused again and again to say ‘God bless him.’ And 
now we send you our hand clasp and message—‘God bless 
him and all of his.’ There, now! You may pile up your 
baggage a little higher—pull your hat down over your 
eyes a little farther—and pretend to sleep a little 
harder. We will leave you. But not in peace. More likely in 
pieces. For I see other people, crowding in from the other 
car, with their glittering eyes gimleted upon you.”</p>
          <pb id="washi264" n="264"/>
          <p>Barret Wendell, Professor of English at Harvard 
University, wrote him: “Will you allow me to express the
pleasure which your book, ‘Up from Slavery,’ has given
me? For about twenty years a teacher of English, and
mostly of English composition, I have become perhaps a
judge as to matters of style. Certainly I have grown less
and less patient of all writing which is not simple and
efficient; and more and more to believe in a style which does
its work with a simple, manly distinctness. It is hard
to remember when a book, casually taken up, has proved,
in this respect, so satisfactory as yours. No style could be
more simple, more unobtrusive; yet few styles which I
know, seem to me, more laden—as distinguished from
overburdened—with meaning. On almost any of your
pages you say as much again as most men would say in
the space; yet you say it as simply and easily that one
has no effort in reading. One is simply surprised at the
quiet power which can so make words do their work.”</p>
          <p>Thus was received the simple narrative of his life up to
this time as hastily written down in odd moments snatched
from his already overcrowded days. In this country
alone more than 110,000 copies of the book have since
been sold. It has been translated into French, Spanish,
German, Hindustani, and Braille.</p>
          <p>Booker Washington's philosophy as to money raising
after a generation of constant and successful experience
was summed up in this statement which he made in “Up
from Slavery”: “My experience in getting money for
Tuskegee has taught me to have no patience with those
<pb id="washi265" n="265"/>
people who are always condemning the rich because they
are rich, because they do not give more to objects of
charity. In the first place, those who are guilty of such
sweeping criticisms do not know how many people would
be made poor, and how much suffering would result if
wealthy people were to part all at once with any large
proportion of their wealth in a way to disorganize and
cripple great business enterprises. Then very few people
have any idea of the large number of applications for help
that rich people are constantly being flooded with. I
know wealthy people who receive as many as twenty calls
a day for help. More than once, when I have gone into
offices of rich men, I have found half a dozen persons 
waiting to see them, and all come for the same purpose, that
of securing money. And all these calls in person, to say
nothing of the applications received through the mails.
Very few people have any idea of the amount of money
given away by persons who never permit their names to
be known. I have often heard persons condemned for
not giving away money, who, to my own knowledge, were
giving away thousands of dollars every year so quietly
that the world knew nothing about it. . . . Although
it has been my privilege to be the medium through which a
good many hundred thousand dollars have been received
for the work at Tuskegee, I have always avoided what the
world calls ‘begging.’ My experience and observation
have convinced me that persistent asking outright for
money from the rich does not, as a rule, secure help. I
have usually proceeded on the principle that persons who
<pb id="washi266" n="266"/>
possess sense enough to earn money have sense enough to
know how to give it away, and that the mere making
known of the facts regarding the work of the graduates
has been more effective than outright begging. I think
that the presentation of facts, on a high, dignified plane,
is all the begging that most rich people care for.”</p>
          <p>Although this favorable estimate of the money-giving
rich was based upon many years of successful experience
it must not be supposed that Booker Washington did not
have his share of rebuffs and discouragements. In fact,
scarcely a day went by that he did not receive some such
disheartening rebuff as the following note from a man who
had for several years contributed a small sum each year to
Tuskegee Institute:</p>

to President Washington's appeal of the 6th inst.</p>
                  <p>I do not understand why such an appeal should be
necessary after the large gifts by Mr. Kennedy and others.
The Indians have received much less than the Negroes in
money and care, yet they beg less, and are more ready to
imitate the whites in being self-reliant. All over the
North I find the Negroes despised by the whites for their
laziness and disposition to be dependent.</p>

                  <p>My DEAR SIR: Our Treasurer has shown me your letter
of May 10th, in which you inquire as to why it should be
necessary for Tuskegee to appeal to the public for 
additional funds, also stating that the Indians receive much
less than Negroes in money and care.</p>
                  <p>Under the circumstances, I thought you would not 
object to my making the following report to you, covering
the inquiries suggested in your letter.</p>
                  <p>The Indians from a financial standpoint are better off
than any other race or class of people in this country.
The 265,863 Indians in the United States own 72,535,862
acres of land, which is 273 acres for each Indian man,
woman, and child. If all the land in the country were
apportioned among the inhabitants there would be 20
acres per person. The value of property and funds
belonging to Indians is $678,564,253, or $2,554 per capita,
or about $10,000 per family. The Negroes, but lately
emancipated, are by contrast poor and are struggling to
rise.</p>
                  <p>The Indians are carefully looked after by the United
States Government. In addition to the elaborately 
organized Indian Bureau at Washington, there are six
thousand (6,000) persons in the Indian field service, to
especially look after and supervise them. There is one
director, supervisor, or teacher for each 44 Indians.</p>
                  <p>Some of the things that the Government does for the
Indians are:</p>
                  <pb id="washi268" n="268"/>
                  <p>(1) Look after the health of the Indians; for this purpose
there are in the field one Medical Supervisor, 100 regular and
60 contract physicians, 54 nurses, and 88 field matrons.</p>
                  <p>(2) Supervise their farming and stock raising. For the 24,489
Indians engaged in farming there are two general supervisors,
48 expert farmers, that is, men with experience and 
scientific knowledge, and 210 men in subordinate farming 
positions.</p>
                  <p>Over $7,000,000 have been spent in irrigating lands for
Indians. Congress in 1911 appropriated $1,300,000 for this
purpose. For the 890,000 Negro farmers in the South, the
United States Government maintains 34 Agricultural
Demonstration Agents.</p>
                  <p>For the supervision of the 44,985 Indians engaged in stock
raising, the Government maintains 22 superintendents of live
stock. For the 700,000 Negro farmers engaged in live stock
raising there is only one Government expert working
especially among them.</p>
                  <p>(3) A system of schools is maintained by the Government
for Indian children. For this purpose there are 223 day
schools, 79 reservation boarding schools, and 35 boarding
schools away from reservations. In these schools in 1911 there
were 24,500 pupils. For the support of these schools the
United States Government for 1912 appropriated $3,757,495.
To assist in teaching the 1,700,000 Negro children in the 
South there was received in 1911 from the United States
Government $245,518.</p>
                  <p>In general the Indians are not taxed for any purpose. On
the other hand, the Negroes are taxed the same as other
persons and in this way contribute a considerable amount for
their own education and the education of the whites. In this
connection, I call your attention to the enclosed pamphlet
“Public Taxation and Negro Schools.” </p>
                  <pb id="washi269" n="269"/>
                  <p>I enclose herewith copy of my Last Annual Report,

Institution.</p>

          </q>
          <p>On October 25, 1915, a few weeks before he died, Mr.
Washington delivered an address before the delegates to
the National Council of Congregational Churches, in
New Haven, Conn., in which he well illustrated his belief
already quoted, “that a large part of the mission of both
Hampton and Tuskegee is to keep the cause of Negro
education before the country.” He said in part:</p>
          <p>“There is sometimes much talk about the inferiority
of the Negro. In practice, however, the idea appears
to be that he is a sort of super-man. He is expected with
about one-fifth or one-tenth of what the whites receive
for their education to make as much progress as they are
making. Taking the Southern States as a whole, about
$10.23 per capita is spent in educating the average white
boy or girl, and the sum of $2.82 per capita in educating
the average black child.</p>
          <p>“In order to furnish the Negro with educational facilities 
so that the 2,000,000 children of school age now out of
school and the 1,000,000 who are unable to read or write
can have the proper chance in life <hi rend="italics">it will be necessary
to increase the</hi> $9,000,000 <hi rend="italics">now being expended annually
for Negro public school education in the South</hi> to about
$25,000,000 or $30,000,000 annually.”</p>
          <p>And in conclusion he said: “At the present rate, it is
<pb id="washi270" n="270"/>
taking not a few days or a few years, but a century or
more to get Negro education on a plane at all similar to
that on which the education of the whites now is. To
bring Negro education up where it ought to be will take
the combined and increased efforts of all the agencies now
engaged in this work. The North, the South, the religious
associations, the educational boards, white people and
black people, all will have to coöperate in a great effort
for this common end.”</p>
          <p>These were the last words he ever spoke at a great
public meeting. They show his acute realization of the
immensity of the task to which he literally gave his life,
and his dread lest what had been accomplished be 
overestimated with a consequent slackening of effort.</p>
          <p>A very cordial friendship existed between Mr. 
Washington and his Trustees. Every man among them was his
selection and joined the Board on his invitation. In the
year 1912 they manifested their friendship and interest
in the most practical of ways by volunteering to raise a
guarantee fund of $50,000 a year for five years to help
bridge the ever-widening gap between the income of the
school and its unavoidably mounting expenses. To do
this, aside from contributing handsomely themselves,
almost all went out and “begged” of their friends. Mr.
Julius Rosenwald of Chicago, for instance, after making
his own liberal personal contribution, and soliciting funds
among his Chicago friends, left his great and absorbing
interests at a busy time of the year to go to New York
and devote a week's time to “begging” money for 
<pb id="washi271" n="271"/>
Tuskegee among his friends and acquaintances. Messrs.
Low, Willcox, Trumbull, Mason, and others also 
personally solicited funds. Many men have gotten 
millionaires to give large sums of money, but how many men
have ever gotten millionaires both to give large sums
and personally to solicit large sums for a purely unselfish
purpose?</p>
          <p>In his final report Booker Washington said of this
guarantee fund: “It is not possible to describe in words
what a relief and help this $50,000 guarantee fund has
proven during the four years it has been in existence.
. . . We shall have to begin now to consider some
method of replacing these donations. The relief which
has come to us because of this guarantee fund has been
marked and far reaching.”</p>
          <p>The same qualities which enabled Booker Washington
to get close to the plain people helped him to win the
confidence of the great givers. Through his money-raising 
efforts he constantly added to his great stock of
knowledge of human nature. Also the same qualities
of heart and mind which enabled him to rise superior to
the obstacles of race prejudice helped him to bear without
discouragement or bitterness the many rebuffs of the
money raiser. One cannot help speculating, however,
on the loss to Tuskegee, to the Negro race, and to the
general welfare, entailed by the necessity of his devoting
two-thirds of his time, strength, and resourcefulness merely
to the raising of money.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER ELEVEN</head>
          <head>MANAGING A GREAT INSTITUTION</head>
          <p>BOOKER WASHINGTON'S chief characteristic as an
administrator was his faculty for attention to minute
details without losing sight of his large purposes and
ultimate ends. His grasp of every detail seems more
remarkable when one realizes the dimensions of his
administrative task. Besides leading his race in America, 
and to some extent throughout the world, and raising
between one hundred thousand and two hundred thousand 
dollars each year, he administered an institution
whose property and endowment are valued at almost
four million dollars. Although the original property of
the school was only a hundred acres of land with three
small buildings, it now owns twenty-four hundred acres,
with one hundred and eleven buildings, large and small,
in its immediate vicinity. In addition to these twenty-four 
hundred acres of land the school now owns also about
twenty thousand acres, being the unsold balance of a
grant of twenty-five thousand acres of mineral land, made
by the Federal Government as an endowment to the
Institute in 1899.</p>
          <p>The organization of the Institute ramifies throughout
the entire county in which it is located. It has a resident
<pb id="washi273" n="273"/>
student population of between fifteen hundred and two
thousand boys and girls, with a teaching force of about two
hundred men and women. It enrolls in its courses throughout
the year from thirty-five hundred to four thousand persons.
The receipts of its post office exceed those of the entire 
postal service of the Negro Republic of Liberia in Africa. 
In a given year the revenues of Liberia were $301,238 and the
expenditures $314,000. In the same year the receipts from all
sources of Tuskegee Institute were $321,864.87 and its
expenditures $341,141.58.</p>
          <p>Booker Washington so organized this great institution that it
ran smoothly and without apparent loss of momentum for the
nine months out of the twelve, during the greater part of 
which he was obliged to be absent raising the funds with 
which to keep it going. The Institute is in continuous 
session throughout the twelve months of the year. During 
the summer months a summer school for teachers is conducted 
in place of the academic department. For the purposes of 
this summer school all or most of the trades and industries 
are kept in operation.</p>
          <p>The school is organized on this basis. There is, first, a 
Board of Trustees which holds the property in trust and 
advises the principal as to general policies, etc., and 
aids him in the raising of funds; second, the principal, 
who has sole charge of all administrative matters; third, 
an executive council, composed of the heads of departments, 
with the principal as its chairman. The following officers 
serve as members of this executive council: Principal, 
treasurer, secretary, general superintendent of industries,
<pb id="washi274" n="274"/>
director mechanical industries, director department
of research and Experiment Station, commandant,
business agent, chief accountant, director agricultural
department, registrar, medical director, dean women's
department, director women's industries, chaplain, director 
extension department, superintendent buildings and
grounds, dean Phelps Hall Bible Training School, director
academic department.</p>
          <p>The position of general superintendent of industries is
held by John H. Washington, brother of Booker T. 
Washington. Mrs. Booker T. Washington fills the position of
director women's industries.</p>
          <p>After this executive council comes the faculty made up of 
the leading teachers who have charge of the instruction in 
the various divisions of the agricultural, industrial,
and academic departments. This faculty Mr. Washington in 
turn subdivided into a series of standing and special
committees having particular charge of certain phases of
the work such as repairs, cleanliness, etc. The committee
on cleanliness would, for instance, be expected to see that
the boarding department was insisting upon the proper
use of knives and forks and napkins—was serving the
food hot and in proper dishes, and that the kitchens were
at all times ready for inspection and models of cleanliness.</p>
          <p>In the same way he constantly appointed committees
to go into the academic classes and see that they were
correlating their work with the trade work. The tendency 
to backslide is especially strong in an institution
which, like Tuskegee, is working out original problems.
<figure id="ill12" entity="wash274a"><p>Some of Mr. Washington's humble friends (<hi rend="italics">see page 136</hi>)</p></figure>
<figure id="ill13" entity="wash274b"><p>Soil analysis. The students are required to work
out in the laboratory the problems of the field
and the shop</p></figure>
<pb id="washi275" n="275"/>
It is fatally easy for the teachers in both academic and
industrial classes to slip away from the correlative method,
for which the institution stands, back to the traditional
routine. The correlative method requires constant
thought. As Mr. Washington well knew, the average
person only thinks under constant prodding. Hence,
the committees to do the prodding! It is so much easier
to take one's problems from the text-books than to dig
them up in the shops or on the farm as to be practically
irresistible unless one is being watched. Then, in the
shops it requires a constant effort to work the theory in
with the practice. If the instructors in the trades tended
to become mere unthinking mechanics a vigilant committee 
was at hand to keep them true to their better lights.
And if the committees themselves ever became slack, the
all-seeing eye of the principal soon detected it and they
in turn were “jacked up.” Mr. Washington himself had
a way of leisurely strolling about day or night into shop,
classroom, or laboratory with a stenographer at his elbow.
If he thus came upon a recitation in which no illustrative
material was used, that teacher would receive within the
next few hours a note such as this:</p>

the Children's House, and Mrs. Ferguson, Head of the
Division of Education, and Mr. Whiting of the Division
of Mathematics, who understand our methods of teaching
and try to learn our methods.</p>

If Mr. Smith will go to the new Laundry Building, in

                  <p>When you return, I want to urge that you give careful
but serious attention to the following suggestions:</p>
                  <p>First, I am convinced that we must arrange to give
more systematic and constant attention to the individual
teachers in your department in the way of seeing that they
<pb id="washi277" n="277"/>
follow your wishes and policy regarding the dovetailing
of the academic work into the industrial work.</p>
                  <p>I am quite convinced that the matter is taken up in
rather a spasmodic way; that is, so long as you are on
hand and can give the matter personal attention, it is
followed, but when you cease to give personal attention
to it or are away, matters go back to the old rut, or nearly
so.</p>
                  <p>In some way we must all get together and help you to
organize your department so that this will not be true.</p>
                  <p>There are two elements of weakness in the academic
work: First, I very much fear that we take into it every
year too many green teachers, who know nothing about
your methods. This pulls the whole tone of the academic
work down before you can train them into your methods.
I am quite sure that though you might not get teachers
who have had so much book training, that it would be
worth your considering to employ a larger number of
Hampton graduates or Tuskegee graduates, who have
had in a measure the methods which you believe in 
instilled into them.</p>
                  <p>In my opinion, the time has come when you must consider 
seriously the getting rid of, or shifting, some of your
older teachers. You have teachers in your department
who have been here a good many years, and experience
proves that they do not adapt themselves readily and
systematically to your methods. I think it would be
far better for the school to find employment for them
outside of the Academic Department, or to let them
take some clerical work in your department, than for them
to occupy positions of importance and influence, which
they are not filling satisfactorily and where they have an
influence in hurting the character of the whole teaching.</p>
                  <p>All these matters I hope you will consider very carefully.
<pb id="washi278" n="278"/>
I am sure that the time has come when definite and serious
action is needed.</p>

          <p>First and last on these apparently aimless strolls with a
stenographer he visited not only the classrooms and
shops but every corner of the great institution. He would
return to his office with a notebook full of memoranda of
matters to be followed up or changed, and of people to
be commended or censured for their efficient or inefficient
handling of this, that, or the other piece of work. Once
after writing a series of letters calling attention to ragged
tablecloths, unclean napkins, and uncleanliness in other
forms in kitchens, bakery, and dining-rooms without the
desired result, he personally took charge of the situation,
organized a squad of workers, put things in proper condition,
and then insisted that they be kept in such condition.</p>
          <p>His passion to utilize every fraction of time to its maximum 
advantage led him even to smuggle a stenographer
into the formal annual exercises of the Bible Training
School so that he might during the exercises clandestinely
dictate notes for the head of the Bible school as to those
features in which the program was weak, failed “to get
across,” did not hold the interest of the people, seemed to
be over their heads, or whatever might be his diagnosis of
the difficulty. He was not interested in the program for
and of itself, but was keenly interested in its effect upon
the people. If it interested and helped them, it was a
good program; if it did not, it was a poor program and no
<pb id="washi279" n="279"/>
amount of learning or technical perfection could redeem it. 
He sometimes reduced his more scholarly teachers to the 
verge of despair by his insistence that there should be 
nothing on the program at any exercise to which the public 
was invited which the every-day man and woman could not 
understand and appreciate.</p>
          <p>In opening the chapter we mentioned Booker Washington's
faculty for giving attention to apparently trivial details 
without losing sight of his large policies and purposes. 
This was part of his habit of taking nothing for granted. 
He never assumed that people would do or had done what they 
should do or should have done any more than he assumed they 
would not or had not done what they should. He neither 
trusted nor distrusted them. He kept himself constantly 
informed. Every person employed by the institution from the 
most important department heads down to the men who removed 
ashes and garbage were under the stimulating apprehension 
that his eye might be upon them at any moment. He harassed 
his subordinates by continually asking them if this or that 
matter had been attended to. He would sometimes ask three 
different people to do the same thing. This resulted in 
wasted effort on somebody's part, but it always 
accomplished the result, which was all that interested him. 
He took nothing for granted himself and he insisted that his
subordinates take nothing for granted. He was a task master
and a “driver” but he taxed himself more heavily and drove
himself harder than he did any one else. Like other strong 
men, he had the weaknesses of his strength, and probably 
his most
<pb id="washi280" n="280"/>
serious weakness was driving himself and his subordinates
beyond his and their strength.</p>
          <p>His eye was daily upon every part of the great machine
which he had built up through an exhaustive system of
daily reports. These reports were placed on his desk each
morning when at the Institute and mailed to him each
morning when away. They showed him the number of
students in the hospital with the name, diagnosis, and
progress of each case. From the poultry yard came 
reports giving the number of eggs in the incubators, the 
number hatched since the day before, the number of chickens
which had died, the number of eggs and chickens sold, etc.
Similarly daily reports came from the swine herd, the
dairy herd, and all the other groups of live stock.</p>
          <p>He received also each morning a report from the savings
department giving the number of new depositors, the
amounts of money deposited and withdrawn, and the 
condition of the bank at the close of the previous day. There
was, too, a list of the requisitions approved by the Business
Committee the previous day giving articles, prices, 
divisions, or departments in which each was to be used and 
totals for different classes of requisitions.</p>
          <p>The Boarding Department head would report just what
had been served the students at the three meals of the day
before. In running over these menus he would give a 
contemptuous snort if he came upon any instance of what he
called “feeding the students out of the barrel.” By this
he meant buying food which could as well or better have
been raised on the Institute farms. He objected to this
<figure id="ill14" entity="wash280"><p>Mr. Washington was a great believer in the sweet
potato. He personaly supervised the work of preparing for sweet potato planting</p></figure>
<pb id="washi281" n="281"/>
practice not only because it was more expensive, but 
because it eliminated the work of raising, preparing, and
serving the foods which he regarded as a valuable 
exercise in civilization. He also insisted that everything
raised on the farms should in one way or another be used
by the students. Besides serving to the students every
variety of Southern vegetable from the Institute's extensive 
truck gardens, he always insisted that their own corn
be ground into meal and that they make their own 
preserves out of their own peaches, blackberries, and other
fruits. In other words, he made the community feed itself 
just as far as possible. And this he did quite as much
because of the knowledge of the processes of right living
which it imparted as for the money which it saved.</p>
          <p>The Treasurer also submitted a daily report of contributions 
and other receipts of the previous day with the
name and address of each contributor. Mr. Washington
arranged to receive and look over these daily reports even
when travelling. Hence, in a sense, he was never absent.
Only very rarely and under most unusual circumstances
did he cut this means of daily contact with the multifold
activities of the institution.</p>
          <p>Although a task master, a driver, and a relentless critic,
he was just in his dealings with his subordinates and his
students, very appreciative of kindness or thoughtfulness,
and generous in his approbation of tasks well done. Three
of the younger children of officers of the school, while out
walking with one of their teachers, discovered a fire in the
woods near the Institute one day. After notifying the men
<pb id="washi282" n="282"/>
working nearby, the children hurried home and wrote Mr.
Washington a letter telling him about the fire. They had
heard him warn people against the danger of forest fires
and of the great harm they did. This letter the three
children excitedly took to the Principal's home themselves,
as it was on Sunday. He was not in, but the first letter he
dictated on arriving at his office the next morning was this:</p>

in inspecting the farm, and I want to congratulate you and
all of your assistants on account of the fine sweet potato
crop which has been produced. It is certainly the finest

                  <p>I believe if the farm goes on under present conditions,

far as the Budget is concerned.</p>

          <p>His quick mind and his keen sense of humor would sometimes 
lead him to make fun in a kindly way of his slower
colleagues. The members of the Executive Council and
the Faculty sometimes felt he treated them rather too
much as if he were the teacher and they the pupils. His
frequent humorous sallies and stories exasperated some of
the more serious-minded members of his staff very much as
Lincoln's sallies and stories exasperated some of the 
members of his Cabinet, particularly Secretary Stanton. This
sense of humor was undoubtedly with Booker Washington
as with Abraham Lincoln one of the great safety valves
without which he could not have carried his heavy burden
as long as he did.</p>
          <p>Among other things he always insisted that the human
element be put into the work of the institution and kept in
it. He would reprimand a subordinate just as sharply for
failure to be human as for a specific neglect of duty. He
was particularly insistent that all letters to the parents of
the students should be intimate and friendly rather than
<pb id="washi284" n="284"/>
formal and stereotyped. He believed that nothing would more
quickly or more surely kill the effectiveness of the school 
than the application of cut-and-dried theories and formulas 
to the handling of the students and their problems. He 
never lost sight of the fact that the most perfect 
educational machine becomes worthless if the soul goes out 
of it.</p>
          <p>On his return from trips he would write a personal letter
about their boy or girl to each parent whom he had met while
away. After he had addressed a meeting and was shaking
hands with those who came forward to meet him a man
would say, as one once did, with embarrassed pride, “I 'spec
you know my boy—he's down to your school. He's a tall, 
black boy an' wears a derby hat.” When Mr. Washington got 
back to Tuskegee he sent for “the tall, black boy” with the 
derby hat and wrote his proud father all about him.</p>
          <p>On his return from journeys he would write individual
letters not only to the parents of students and to his hosts 
and hostesses, but to each and every person who had tried 
in any way to contribute to the pleasure and success of his 
trip. On returning from the State educational tours which we 
have described he would write personal letters of thanks and
appreciation not only to every member of the general
committee on arrangements which had managed his tour
throughout the State, but also to every member of the local
committees for the various towns and cities which he visited.
He would also write such a letter to the Governor or Mayor or
whatever public official or prominent citizen had introduced
him. Usually on these tours 
<pb id="washi285" n="285"/>
school children, or a group of women representing a local
colored women's club, would present him with flowers. He
would in such cases insist that the name of each child or 
each woman in the group be secured so that he might on his 
return write to each one a personal letter of thanks. Many 
such letters are now among the treasured possessions of 
humble Negro homes throughout the country.</p>
          <p>Recognizing that Tuskegee's chief claim to support from
the public must be found in the achievements of her
graduates he built up the Division of Records and Research
to keep in constant touch with the graduates and gather
information about them and their work. By this means he
could find out in detail at a moment's notice what most of 
the graduates were doing and in terms of statistics what 
all were doing. Eighteen to twenty of them are building up or
conducting schools on the model of Tuskegee Institute in
parts of the South where they are most needed. With these
he naturally sought to keep in particularly close touch.</p>
          <p>With funds provided for the purpose by one of the
Tuskegee Trustees, committees of Tuskegee officers and
teachers are sent from time to time to visit these schools
established by Tuskegee graduates. They act as friendly
inspectors and advisers. The following is the plan of report
drafted for the guidance of these committees:</p>

          <p>To all the graduates of the Institute Mr. Washington
sent a circular letter on the first of each year in which
frequently he told them of the progress that had been
made by the school during the year in improvements,
number of students enrolled, etc., and asked them in turn
to answer a list of questions about their life and work, or
sometimes in such letters he merely wished them success
and gave them some practical advice. The 1913 letter
which follows is an example of the latter:</p>

                  <p>I take this opportunity to send you greetings, to inquire
how you are getting along, and to express the hope that
in every way you are prospering. If, however, you are
having discouragements, I trust that you are meeting
them bravely. If you have difficulties, or are laboring
under disadvantages, use them as stepping-stones to
success.</p>
                  <p>I again call your attention to the importance of keeping
in touch with the Institute. Keeping your address on
file with us and sending a report of your work will assist
in doing this. I enclose herewith a blank for that 
purpose. Visits to the school should also be made from time
to time. You should begin to prepare now to be here
during the coming commencement exercises in May in
order that you may see what is being done at the institution 
and to meet your former classmates. Already the
officers of the General Alumni Association have begun
preparations for your welcome.</p>
                  <p>I urge upon you the importance of keeping up the habit
<pb id="washi288" n="288"/>
of study and of reading good books and papers. The 
accompanying circular on “How to Buy Books” gives 
valuable suggestions about how to secure the best books
cheaply. I take this occasion to inform you that already
we are making preparations for our 1913 Summer School.
It is hoped that every graduate who is teaching will attend
this or some other good summer school.</p>
                  <p>I trust that wherever you are located you will do all that
you can for community uplift. Be active in church and
Sunday-school work, help to improve the public schools,
assist in bettering health conditions, help the people to
secure property, to buy homes and to improve them. In
doing all these things, you will be carrying out the 
Tuskegee idea.</p>

          <p>As previously mentioned the relationship between Mr.
Washington and his Trustees was at all times particularly
friendly and harmonious. While they were always 
directors who directed instead of mere figureheads, they
nevertheless were broad enough and wise enough to give
the Principal a very free reign. Preëminent among the
able and devoted Trustees of Tuskegee was the late 
William H. Baldwin, Jr. In order to commemorate his life
and work the William H. Baldwin, Jr., Memorial Fund of
$150,000 was raised by a committee of distinguished men,
with Oswald Garrison Villard of the New York <hi rend="italics">Evening
Post</hi> as chairman, among whom were Theodore Roosevelt,
Grover Cleveland, and Charles W. Eliot, and placed at
the disposal of the Tuskegee Trustees. A bronze memorial 
tablet in memory of Mr. Baldwin was at the same time
placed on the Institute grounds. At the ceremony at
which this tablet was unveiled and this fund presented to
the Trustees, Mr. Washington said in part, in speaking of
<pb id="washi290" n="290"/>
his relations with Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Baldwin's 
relations to Tuskegee:</p>
          <p>“Only those who are close to the business structure of
the institution could really understand what the coming
into our work of a man like William H. Baldwin meant
to all of us. In the first place, it meant the bringing into
our work a certain degree of order, a certain system, so far
as the business side of the institution was concerned, that
had not hitherto existed. Then the coming of him into our
institution meant the bringing of new faith, meant the
bringing of new friends. I shall never forget my first
impression. I shall never forget my first experience in
meeting Mr. Baldwin. At that time he was the General
Manager and one of the Vice-Presidents of the Southern
Railway. located then in its headquarters in the city of
Washington. I remember that, a number of days previous, 
I had gone to the city of Boston and had asked his
father if he would not give me a line of introduction to 
his son, about whom I had already heard in Washington.
Mr. Baldwin's father readily gave me a line of introduction 
and I went in a few days after that and sought out Mr.
Baldwin in his Washington office and he looked through
this letter of introduction, read it carefully, then he looked
me over, up and down, and I asked him if he would not
become a trustee of this institution. After looking me
over, looking me up and down for a few seconds or a few
minutes longer, he said, ‘No, I cannot become a trustee;
I will not say I will become a trustee because when I give
my word to become a trustee it must mean something.
<figure id="ill15" entity="wash290"><p>Mr. Washington had this picture especially posed
to show off to the best advantage a part of the
Tuskegee dairy herd</p></figure>
<pb id="washi291" n="291"/>
He said, ‘I will study the institution at Tuskegee, I will 
go there and look it over and after I have found out what 
your methods are, what you are driving at—if your 
methods and objects commend themselves to me, then I will 
consent to become a trustee.’ And I remember how well
—some of the older teachers and perhaps some of the older
students will recall—that upon one day, when we were 
least expecting it, he stopped his private car off here at 
Chehaw and appeared here upon our grounds, and some of us 
will recall how he went into every department of the 
institution, how he went into the classrooms, how he went
through the shops, how he went through the farm, how he went
through the dining-room; I remember how he went to each
table, and took pieces of bread from the table and broke them
and examined the bread to see how well it was cooked, and
even tasted some of it as he went into the kitchen. He wanted
to be sure how we were doing things here at Tuskegee. Then
after he had made this visit of examination for himself, 
after he had studied our financial condition, then after a 
number of months had passed by, he consented to permit us 
to use his name as one of our Trustees, and from the 
beginning to the end we never had such a trustee. He was 
one who devoted himself night and day, winter and summer, 
in season and out of season, to the interests of this 
institution. Now, having spoken this word, you can 
understand the thoughts and the feelings of some of us on 
this occasion as we think of the services of this great and 
good man.</p>
          <p>“It is one of the privileges of people who are not always
<pb id="washi292" n="292"/>
classed among the popular people of earth to have strong
friends for the reason that nobody but a strong man will
endure the public criticism that so often comes to one who
is the friend of a weak or unpopular race. This, in the
words of another, is one of the advantages enjoyed 
sometimes by a disadvantaged race.”</p>
          <p>Naturally no account of Booker Washington's administration 
of the great institution which he built would be
complete without some mention of Mrs. Washington's
part in her husband's work. Aside from her duties as wife,
mother, and home maker—duties which any ordinary
woman would find quite exacting enough to absorb all her
time, thought, and strength particularly in view of the
fact that a wide hospitality is part of the rôle—Mrs.
Washington, as director of women's industries, is one of
the half-dozen leading executives of the institution. In
addition to her many and varied family and official duties
at the Institute Mrs. Washington has always been a
leader in social service and club work among the women of
her race throughout the country, and has besides all this
come to be a kind of mother confessor, advisor, and guide
to hundreds of young men and women. We will conclude
this chapter by quoting in large part an article written
by Mr. Scott and published some years ago in the <hi rend="italics">Ladies'
Home Journal</hi>, which describes how and when Mrs. 
Washington entered her husband's life and work and the part
she played in his affairs:</p>
          <p>“Even before the war closed there came to the South
on the heels of the army of emancipation an army of
<pb id="washi293" n="293"/>
school teachers. They came to perfect with the spelling-book 
and the reader the work that the soldiers had begun
with the sword. It was during this period in the little
straggling village of Macon, Miss., that a little girl,
called then Margaret Murray, but who is known now as
Mrs. Booker T. Washington, was born. When she grew
old enough to count she found herself one of a family of
ten and, like nearly all children of Negro parentage, at
that time, very poor.</p>
          <p>“In the grand army of teachers who went South in
1864 and 1865 were many Quakers. Prevented by the
tenets of their religion from entering the army as soldiers
these people were the more eager to do the not less 
difficult and often dangerous work of teachers among the
freedmen after the war was over.</p>
          <p>“One of the first memories of her childhood is of her
father's death. It was when she was seven years old.
The next day she went to the Quaker school teachers, a
brother and sister, Sanders by name, and never went
back home to live.</p>
          <p>“Thus at seven she became the arbiter of her own fate.
The incident is interesting in showing thus early a certain
individuality and independence of character which she
has exhibited all through her life. In the breaking or
loosening of the family relations after the death of her
father she determined to bestow herself upon her Quaker
neighbors. The secret of it, of course, was that the child
was possessed even then with a passion for knowledge
which has never since deserted her. Rarely does a day
<pb id="washi294" n="294"/>
pass that Mrs. Washington amid the cares of her household, 
of the school, and of the many philanthropic and
social enterprises in which she takes a leading part, does
not devote half or three-quarters of an hour to downright
study.</p>
          <p>“And so it was that Margaret Murray became at seven
a permanent part of the Quaker household, and became
to all intents and purposes, so far as her habits of thought
and religious attitude are concerned, herself a Quaker.</p>
          <p>“‘And in those early days,’ says Mrs. Washington,
laughing, ‘I learned easily and quickly. It was only
after I grew up that I began to grow dull. I used to sit
up late at night and get up early in the morning to study
my lessons. I was not always a good child, I am sorry
to say, and sometimes I would hide away under the house
in order to read and study.’ . . .</p>
          <p>“When Margaret Murray was fourteen years old the
good Quaker teacher said one day, ‘Margaret, would thee
like to teach?’ That very day the little girl borrowed a
long skirt and went downtown to the office of Judge Ames,
and took her examination. It was not a severe examination. 
Judge Ames had known Margaret all her life and
he had known her father, and in those days white people
were more lenient with Negro teachers than they are now.
They did not expect so much of them. And so, the next
day, Margaret Murray stepped into the schoolroom
where she had been the day before a pupil and became a
teacher. . . .</p>
          <p>“Then Margaret heard of the school at Nashville—
<pb id="washi295" n="295"/>
Fisk University—and she went there. She had a little 
money when she started to school, and with that and what she 
was able to earn at the school and by teaching during 
vacations she managed to work her way as—what was termed 
rather contemptuously in those days—a ‘half-rater.’ It 
was not the fashion at that time, in spite of the poverty 
of the colored people, for students to work their way 
through school.</p>
          <p>“In those days very little had been heard at Fisk of
Tuskegee, of Hampton, or of Booker T. Washington. Students
who expected to be teachers were looking forward to going to
Texas. Texas has always been more favorable to Negro
education than other Southern States and has always got the
best of Negro public school teachers.</p>
          <p>“But upon graduation day, June, 1889, Booker T.
Washington was at Fisk, and he sat opposite Margaret Murray
at table. About that time it was arranged that she should 
go to Texas, but, without knowing just how it came about, she
decided to go to Tuskegee and become what was then called
the Lady Principal of the school. Mrs. Washington has been at
Tuskegee ever since.</p>
          <p>“Mrs. Washington's duties as the wife of the Principal of
the Tuskegee Institute are many and various. She has charge
of all the industries for girls. She gives much time to the
extension work of the school, which includes the ‘Mothers'
meetings’ in the town of Tuskegee and the ‘plantation
settlement’ nearby. Her most characteristic trait, however, 
is a boundless sympathy which has made her a sort of Mother
Confessor to students and
<pb id="washi296" n="296"/>
teachers of the Institute. All go to her for comfort and
advice.</p>
          <p>“The ‘mothers' meetings’ grew out of the first Tuskegee
Negro Conference held at Tuskegee in February, 1892.
Mrs. Washington, as she sat in the first meeting of Negro
farmers and heard what they had to say, was impressed
with the fact that history was repeating itself. Here
again, as in the early days of the woman's suffrage 
movement, women had no place worth mentioning in the 
important concerns of life outside the household. While
there were many women present at this first conference,
they did not seem to realize that they had any interest
in the practical affairs that were being discussed by their
sons and husbands. While her husband was trying to
give these farmers new ideas, new hopes, new aspirations,
the thought came to Mrs. Washington that the Tuskegee
village was the place for her to begin a work which should
eventually include all the women of the county and of the
neighboring counties. The country colored women crowd
into the villages of the South on Saturday, seeking to
vary the monotony of their hard and cheerless lives.
Mrs. Washington determined to get hold of these women
and utilize the time spent in town to some good purpose.
Accordingly, the first mothers' meeting was organized in
the upper story of an old store which then stood on the
main street of the village. The stairs were so rickety
that the women were almost afraid to ascend them. It
answered the purpose temporarily, however, and there
was no rent to pay. How to get the women to the meeting
<pb id="washi297" n="297"/>
was, for a time, a question. For fear of opposition
Mrs. Washington took no one into her confidence except
the man who let her have the room. She sent a small boy
through the streets with the instruction to go to every
colored woman loitering about the streets and say: ‘There
is a woman upstairs who has something for you.’ Mrs.
Washington says: ‘That first meeting I can never forget.
The women came, and each one, as she entered, looked
at me and seemed to say, ‘Where is it?’ We talked it
all over, the needs of our women of the country, the
best way of helping each other, and there and then began
the first mothers' meeting which now has in its 
membership two hundred and twenty-nine women.’</p>
          <p>“Mrs. Washington asked some of the teachers at
Tuskegee to begin to help these people (the people of
the country districts surrounding the school). At first
they went to the plantation (selected for the purpose)
on Sundays only. Mrs. Washington selected what
seemed to be the most promising cabin and asked the
woman who lived there if she could come to that house
the next Sunday and hold a meeting. When the party
went down early the next Sunday morning a stout new
broom was taken along. Making the woman a present
of the broom, it was suggested that all take a hand in
cleaning the house a little before the people should begin
to come. The woman took the broom and swept half of
the room, when Mrs. Washington volunteered to finish
the job.</p>
          <p>“She had not gone far along on her half before the
<pb id="washi298" n="298"/>
woman was saying: ‘Oh, Mis' Washington, lemme take
de brom an' do mah half ovah.’ Mrs. Washington says:
‘I have always thought that that one unconscious lesson
in thoroughness was the foundation of our work on that
plantation.’ . . .</p>
          <p>“Not the least of the duties which fall to Mrs. Washington 
is that of caring for the distinguished people who
visit the Tuskegee Institute. The Tuskegee rule that
everything must be in readiness for the inspection of
visitors, as much so in the kitchen as in any other 
department of the school, prevails in her home also.</p>
          <p>“An interesting part of this home life is the Sunday
morning breakfast. The teachers have slept later than
usual, and, through the year, when Mr. Washington is at
home, they are invited in groups of three and four to
share this morning meal. In this way he keeps in 
personal touch with each of his teachers; he knows what they
are doing; he hears their complaints, if they have any;
he counsels with them; they ‘get together.’</p>
          <p>“Mrs. Washington's labors for the good of her people
are not confined to the school. She is (has been) president
of the Southern Federation of Colored Women's Clubs,
editor of the official organ of the National Federation of
Colored Women's Clubs, of which she is also an officer.
She is a frequent contributor to the newspapers and
magazines. (Mrs. Washington has since served two
terms as president of the National Federation of Colored
Women's Clubs.)</p>
          <p>“Mr. Washington's own estimate of his wife's 
<pb id="washi299" n="299"/>
helpfulness to him may be gathered from his tribute in his
widely read autobiography, ‘Up from Slavery’: ‘She
is completely one with me in the work directly connected
with the school, relieving me of many burdens and 
perplexities.’”</p>

        <div2 type="chapter">
          <pb id="washi300" n="300"/>
          <head>CHAPTER TWELVE</head>
          <head>WASHINGTON: THE MAN</head>
          <p>JUST as in the first chapter we sought to show the
man in the making, so in this last chapter we shall
seek to picture him as he became in the full fruition 
of his life. In the fully developed man of the last
decade of his life we find the same traits and qualities
which began to show themselves in those early years of
constant struggle and frequent privation. There is the
same intense mental and physical activity; the same
readiness to fight against any odds in a good cause; the
same modesty, frankness, open-mindedness, and passion
for service.</p>
          <p>One of the many illustrations of this intense activity was
shown in a trip he made to Atlanta, Ga., three or four years
before he died. Even at this time his strength had begun
to wane. In accordance with his unfailing practice he got
up at six o'clock in the morning, and after visiting his
poultry and his beloved pigs, mounted his horse and rode
over farms and grounds inspecting crops and buildings and
what-not until eight o'clock, when he went to his office and
attacked his huge morning's mail. After dictating for an
hour or more he left his office just in time to catch a train
which brought him to Atlanta at two o'clock in the afternoon.
<pb id="washi301" n="301"/>
noon. At the station he shook hands with four hundred
people who had gathered to meet him. As he went along
the streets to the Government Building he shook hands
with many others who recognized him in passing. At the
Government Building he shook hands with another large
group assembled there to meet him. After the dinner
tendered him by some of the leading individuals and 
associations among the Negroes of the city he posed for his
photograph with a group of those at the dinner. He then
made a tour of the city by motor, during which he visited
three or four schools for Negroes and at each made a 
half-hour speech into which, as always, he threw all the 
force and energy there was in him.</p>
          <p>After supper that evening he addressed twelve hundred
people in the Auditorium Armory, speaking for an hour
and a half. From the armory he went to a banquet given
in his honor where he gave a twenty-minute talk. He did
not get to bed until one o'clock. Four hours later he took a
return train which brought him back to the school by 
ten-thirty. He went at once to his office and to work, working
until late in the afternoon when he called for his horse and
took his usual ride before supper. After supper he 
presided at a meeting of the Executive Council and after the
Council meeting he attended the Chapel exercises. After
these exercises were over at ten o'clock he made an 
inspection on foot of various parts of the buildings and
grounds before going to bed. By just such excessive 
overwork did he constantly undermine and finally break down
his almost superhuman strength and powers of endurance.
<pb id="washi302" n="302"/>
This he did with an obstinate persistence in spite of wise
and increasingly urgent warnings from physicians, friends,
and associates. Where his own health was concerned he
obdurately refused to listen to reason. It would almost
seem as though he had deliberately chosen to put forth
herculean efforts until he dropped from sheer exhaustion
rather than to work with moderation for a longer span of
life.</p>
          <p>Booker Washington was a man who thought, lived, and
acted on a very high plane. He was, in other words, an
idealist, but unlike too many idealists he was sternly 
practical. His mind worked with the rapidity of flashes of
lightning, particularly when he was aroused. This led
him at times to feel and show impatience in dealing with
slower-minded people, particularly his subordinates. He
was often stirred to righteous indignation by injustice, but
always kept his temper under control. He had a lucid
mind which reasoned from cause to effect with machine-like 
accuracy. His intuitions were amazingly keen and
accurate. In other words, his subconscious reasoning
powers were very highly developed. Consequently his
judgments of men and events were almost infallible. 
Although practically devoid of personal vanity, he was a very
proud and independent man, and one who could not brook
dictation from any one or bear to be under obligation to
any one. He had the tenacity of a bulldog. His capacity
for incessant work and his unswerving pursuit of a purpose
once formed, were a constant marvel to those who 
surrounded him. While he was without conceit or vanity he
<pb id="washi303" n="303"/>
had almost unlimited self-confidence. While it cannot be said
that he overrated his own abilities, neither can it be said 
that he underrated them. His sympathies were easily aroused 
and he was abnormally sensitive, but he never allowed his
emotions to get the better of his judgment. He forgave easily
and always tried to find excuses for people who wronged,
insulted, or injured him. In repartee he could hold his own 
with any one and enjoyed nothing more than a duel of wits 
either with an individual or an audience.</p>
          <p>Less than a month before he died, when he was wasted by
disease and suffering almost constant pain, he received this
letter of appeal from Madame Helena Paderewski:</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>MY DEAR MR. WASHINGTON: I am writing you a very
personal letter on a subject that is close to my heart, and 
I know the message it carries will find a response in your
generous sympathy. It is with great pleasure that I recall 
our meeting, some years ago, and I have watched the success 
of your work among your people with sincere satisfaction, for 
I have always been an advocate of the principles for which 
you stand, the uplift of the colored race.</p>
                  <p>It is because I know you have ever directed your broad
influence toward the most worthy causes that I am asking
you in the name of the starving babies and their helpless
mothers, to tell your people that we need them in our work of
sending food and medicines to Poland. We need, my dear sir,
even the smallest contribution that your beloved followers
may offer, and I beg of you to make an appeal to your people.
Tell them, for they may not all know as well 
<pb id="washi304" n="304"/>
as you, yourself, that it was a Pole—Kosciusko—who, 
in addition to fighting for American liberty, gave that which
he needed himself to help the colored race. As you will
recall, after refusing the grant of land offered him in
recognition of his services in the War of the Revolution, he
returned to Poland, not wishing to accept a reward for
doing what he considered a sublime duty to those in need.
Later, after eight years, when he again visited America, he
was given a pension as General in the American Army.
With the back pay during his absence, the sum amounted
to about $15,000. Although poor himself, he felt deep
compassion for the neglected colored children and, with
the money given him, he established the first school in
America devoted exclusively to the education of the
colored youth.</p>
                  <p>I am sure you know the story in all its details, but I 
desire the colored people of America to know that to-day the
descendants of the man who—unasked—aided them—
plead for a crust of bread, a spoonful of milk for their
hungry children. Tell them this and God will bless and
prosper you in your telling and them in their giving. Do
not think that small amounts are useless—five cents may
save a life. I am sending Mr. Paderewski's appeal, but
conditions, to-day, are worse now than when it was written.
Will you help Poland? Will you do it now?</p>
                  <p>Please reply to Hotel Gotham.</p>

fact that he must have realized that his remaining time for
his own chosen work had narrowed down to a matter of
<pb id="washi305" n="305"/>
weeks—he instantly responded to this appeal. 
Immediately he sent Madame Paderewski's letter to the Negro

                  <p>MY DEAR MRS. WASHINGTON: It was with a feeling of

Washington. I have always admired his courage and
wonderful ability, and his passing at this time brings a
double sorrow, for in this morning's mail I received a copy
of the <hi rend="italics">Tuskegee Student</hi> containing my letter and

          <p>Although apparently indifferent to the treatment he 
received from those about him Booker Washington was in
reality, as has been said, unusually sensitive. No matter
what his engagements he always insisted upon being at
home with his wife and children on Thanksgiving Day and
on Christmas. One Christmas, about ten years ago, it so
happened that no Christmas presents were provided for
him. The children gave presents to one another and to
their mother and she to them, but through oversight there
were no presents for Mr. Washington. Mrs. Washington
says that after the presents had been opened her husband
drew her aside and said in broken tones: “Maggie, they've
not given me a single Christmas present!” From then on
Mrs. Washington saw to it that the children remembered
their father at Christmas.</p>
          <p>In Birmingham, Ala., about three years before his death,
he and his secretary entered an office building one day to
call on one of the Tuskegee Trustees whose office was on
the top floor. When they looked for an elevator they were
referred by the hall man to the elevator for colored people.
On this elevator was a sign reading, “For Negroes and
Freight.” His secretary expected him to comment on
this, but he said nothing and seemed hardly to notice it.
<figure id="ill16" entity="wash306a"><p>Mr. Washington feeding his chickens with green
stuffs raised in his own garden</p></figure><figure id="ill17" entity="wash306b"><p>Mr. Washington in his onion patch</p></figure><figure id="ill18" entity="wash306c"><p>Mr. Washington sorting in his lettuce bed</p></figure>
<pb id="washi307" n="307"/>
That evening, in addressing a great audience of both races
in one of the big theatres of the city, he was urging the
Negroes to look upon their Southern white neighbors as
their friends and to turn to them for advice when he said
very slowly and distinctly: “I visited, this morning, a
building which had on the elevator for colored people a
sign reading, ‘For Negroes and Freight.’ Now, my
friends, that is mighty discouraging to the colored man!”
At this not only the colored people, but the white people
sprang to their feet and shouted, many of them, “You're
right, Doctor!” “That's mean!” “That's not fair!”
and other such expressions.</p>
          <p>Every morning before breakfast when at home Mr.
Washington would visit his chickens, pigs, and cows.
He said of finding the newly laid eggs: “I like to find the
new eggs each morning myself, and am selfish enough to
permit no one else to do this in my place. As with growing
plants, there is a sense of freshness and newness and 
restfulness in connection with the finding and handling of
newly laid eggs that is delightful to me. Both the 
realization and the anticipation are most pleasing. I 
begin the day by seeing how many eggs I can find or how
many little chicks there are that are just beginning to
creep through the shells. I am deeply interested in the
different kinds of fowls, and always grow a number of
different breed's at my own home.”</p>
          <p>But none of the animals interested him and aroused his
enthusiasm as did the pigs. He always kept on his own
place some choice specimens of Berkshires and Poland
<pb id="washi308" n="308"/>
Chinas at whose shrine he worshipped each morning. Also he
always insisted that the swine herd of the Institute be kept
recruited up to full strength and in fact considerably beyond
full strength in the opinion of the Agricultural Director 
who in vain protested that it was not profitable to keep so 
large a herd. It would be interesting to know whether the 
great economic importance of the pig to his race was at the 
bottom of Booker Washington's fondness for the animal.</p>
          <p>After breakfast he mounted his horse and made a round of
the Institute farms, truck gardens, dormitories, and shops
before going to his office and attacking his huge
correspondence. This correspondence, both in its dimensions
and catholicity, was typical of the man. His daily incoming 
mail amounted to between 125 and 150 letters. The outgoing 
ran to between 500 and 1,000 letters daily—in large 
part, of course, “campaign letters,” as he called them, 
letters seeking to interest new friends in the work of the 
Institute, and others keeping in touch with friends already 
interested, etc. His advice, opinion, or comments were 
sought on every conceivable subject both by serious and 
sensible men and women and by cranks of both races. Hundreds 
of the humbler people of his own race were constantly 
applying to him for information and advice as to whether it 
would be profitable to start this or that business venture, 
or whether or not it would be possible to establish a 
school in this or that community, and how they should set 
about it.</p>
          <p>Booker Washington's sense of justice was unquenchable.
<pb id="washi309" n="309"/>
While at Coden-on-the-Bay, near Mobile, Ala., in
September, 1915, snatching a few days of rest and recreation
as a palliative for the insidious disease which was so soon to
end his life, he was distressed by a newspaper report of the
killing of a number of Haitians by United States Marines. He
read the report in a Mobile paper late one afternoon on his
return from a fishing trip. He went to bed but could not 
sleep. The misfortunes of the turbulent little black 
republic seethed through his mind. Early in the morning, 
while his companions were still sleeping, he awakened the 
inevitable stenographer and dictated an article counselling 
patience in dealing with the unfortunate little country. 
This article, dictated by a dying man on the impulse of the 
moment, briefly recites the history of Haiti from the period 
over a hundred years ago when the people of the island 
wrested their liberty from France under the leadership of 
Toussaint L'Ouverture, up to the present time. He then says 
in part:</p>
          <p>“Associated Press dispatches a few days ago stated that
forty or fifty Haitians had been killed on Haytian soil in 
one day by American marines and a number of marines wounded.
To every black man in the United States this dispatch brought
a feeling of disappointment and sorrow. While, as I have
stated, the United States, under the circumstances, was
compelled to take notice of conditions in Haiti and is being
compelled to control matters, largely because of the fault of
the Haitians, I had hoped that the United States would be
patient in dealing with the Haitian Government and people.
The United States has been
<pb id="washi310" n="310"/>
patient with Germany. It has been patient in the 
Philippines. It has been exceedingly patient in dealing with
Mexico. I hope this country will be equally patient and
more than patient in dealing with Haiti—a weaker and
more unfortunate country!</p>
          <p>“I very much wish that it might have been possible for
the United States to have taken a little more time in 
making known to the Haitians the purposes we have in mind in
taking over the control of their custom houses and their
governmental affairs. While everything that we intend to
do, and have in mind to do, is perfectly plain to the
officials of the United States, we must remember that all
this is not perfectly plain to the Haitians. It would have
been worth while, in my opinion, before attempting
arbitrarily to force Haiti to sign the treaty put before its
officials, to have spent a little time and a little patience 
in informing the Haitian people of the unselfish benevolence
of our intentions. They, in time, would have understood
why it is necessary to intervene in their affairs.</p>
          <p>“Another reason, in my opinion, why patience may be
manifested in this matter is that the treaty, even at the
best, cannot be ratified by the United States Senate until
it meets in regular session in December, unless the 
President calls it in special session earlier.
“I confess that while I am unschooled in such matters,
since reading the treaty the Haitians have been told they
must ratify, it seems to me rather harsh and precipitate;
one cannot be surprised that the Haitians have hesitated
to agree to all the conditions provided for in this treaty.
<pb id="washi311" n="311"/>
No wonder they have hesitated when they have had so little
time in which to understand it, when the masses of the
Haitian people know little or nothing of what the treaty
contemplates.</p>
          <p>“The way matters are now going, there is likely to be
bitterness and war. The United States, in the end, will
conquer, will control, will have its way, but it is one 
thing to conquer a people through love, through unselfish 
interest in their welfare, and another thing to conquer them 
through the bullet, through the shotgun. Shooting 
civilization into the Haitians on their own soil will be an 
amazing spectacle. Sending marines as diplomats and Mauser 
bullets as messengers of destruction breed riot and anarchy, 
and are likely to leave a legacy of age-long hatreds and 
regrets.</p>
          <p>“I also hope the United States will not pursue a mere
negative policy in Haiti, that is, a policy of controlling 
the customs and what-not, without going further in 
progressive, constructive directions. In a word, the United 
States now has an opportunity to do a big piece of fine work 
for Haiti in the way of education, something the island has 
never had. I hope some way will be provided by which a 
portion of the revenues will be used in giving the people a 
thorough, up-to-date system of common school, agricultural, 
and industrial education. Here is an excellent opportunity 
for some of the young colored men and women of the United 
States who have been educated in the best methods of 
education in this country to go to Haiti and help their 
fellows. Here is an opportunity for
<pb id="washi312" n="312"/>
some of the most promising Haitian boys and girls to be
sent to schools in the United States. Here is an opportunity 
for us to use our influence and power in giving the
Haitians something they have never had, and that is 
education, real education. At least 95 per cent. of the 
people, as I have said, are unlettered and ignorant so far as
books are concerned.”</p>
          <p>Booker Washington's self-control was never more
needed than on an occasion at Tuskegee described by T.
Thomas Fortune, the Negro author and publicist. A
Confederate veteran who had lost an arm fighting for the
Confederacy and who had served for a number of years
in Congress was on the program to speak at a Tuskegee
meeting. This Confederate veteran had a great liking
for Mr. Washington and believed in his ideas on the 
importance of industrial education for the colored people.
Mr. Fortune says:</p>
          <p>“John C. Dancy, a colored man, at that time Collector
of Customs at Wilmington, N. C., was to speak first, the
Confederate veteran second, and I was to follow the latter. 
Mr. Dancy is an unusually bright and eloquent man.
Mr. Dancy paid a glowing tribute to the New England 
men and women who had built up the educational interest
among the colored people after the war, of which Hampton
and Tuskegee Institutes are lasting monuments. Mr.
Dancy had plenty of applause from the great concourse
of countrymen, but his address made the white speaker
furious. When the former Congressman was called upon
to speak he showed plainly that he was agitated out of his
<pb id="washi313" n="313"/>
self-restraint. Without any introductory remarks 
whatever, he said, as I remember it:</p>
          <p>“‘I have written this address for you,’ waving it at the
audience, ‘but I will not deliver it. I want to give you
niggers a few words of plain talk and advice. No such
address as you have just listened to is going to do you any
good; it's going to spoil you. You had better not listen
to such speeches. You might just as well understand
that this is a white man's country, as far as the South is
concerned, and we are going to make you keep your place.
Understand that. I have nothing more to say to you.’</p>
          <p>“The audience was taken back as much by the bluntness 
of the remarks as if they had been doused with cold
water. Indignation was everywhere visible on the 
countenances of the people. But Mr. Washington appeared
unruffled. On the contrary, his heavy jaw was hard set
and his eyes danced in a merry measure. It was a time to
keep one's temper and wits, and he did so, as usual. 
Without betraying any feeling in the matter, and when 
everybody expected him to announce the next speaker, he said:</p>
          <p>“‘Ladies and Gentlemen: I am sure you will agree with
me that we have had enough eloquence for one occasion.
We shall listen to the next speaker at another occasion,
when we are not so fagged out. We will now rise, sing
the doxology, and be dismissed.’</p>
          <p>“The audience did so, but it was the most funereal
proceeding I had ever witnessed upon such an occasion.
Mr. Washington's imperturbable good nature alone saved
the day.”</p>
          <pb id="washi314" n="314"/>
          <p>Some time after President Roosevelt had begun to 
consult Booker Washington on practically all his 
appointments and policies which particularly affected the 
relations between the races, and after several Southern 
white men had been given Federal appointments on Mr. 
Washington's recommendation, the bitterness against him
grew so intense, especially among the “Talented Tenth”
element of the Northern Negroes, that he decided to meet
a group of their leaders face to face, and have it out.
Accordingly, through Mr. Fortune, he arranged to meet a
number of these men at a dinner at Young's Hotel in
Boston. Mr. Fortune thus describes what took place:</p>
          <p>“At the proper time, when the coffee and cigars were
served, I arose and told the diners that Dr. Washington
had desired to meet them at the banquet table and at the
proper time to have each one of them express freely his
opinion of the race question, and how best the race could
be served in the delicate crisis through which it was then
passing. Each of the speakers launched into a tirade
against Dr. Washington and his policies and methods,
many of them in lofty flights of speech they had learned
at Harvard University. The atmosphere was dense with
discontent and denunciation.</p>
          <p>“The climax was reached when William H. Lewis, the
famous Harvard football coach, told Dr. Washington to go
back South, and attend to his work of educating the Negro
and ‘leave to us the matters political affecting the race.’
Every eye was upon Dr. Washington's face, but none of
them could read anything in it; it was as inscrutable as a
<pb id="washi315" n="315"/>
wooden Indian's. When every one of them had had his
say, I called upon Dr. Washington to respond to the 
speakers who had unburdened themselves. Dr. Washington
rose slowly, and with a slip of paper in his hand, said:</p>
          <p>“‘Gentlemen, I want to tell you about what we are
doing at Tuskegee Institute in the Black Belt of 
Alabama.’</p>
          <p>“For more than a half-hour he told them of the needs
and the work without once alluding to anything that had
been said in heat and anger by those to whom he spoke.
He held them close to him by his simple recital, with here
and there a small blaze of eloquence, and then thanking
them for the candor with which they had spoken, sat down.
They were all disappointed, as they expected that he
would attempt to excuse himself for the things they had
complained of.”</p>
          <p>At the time of Mr. Washington's death, the same William 
H. Lewis, who told him at this time to go back to the
South and attend to his work and “leave to us the matters
political affecting the race,” said of him:</p>
          <p>“Words, like tears, are vain and idle things to express
the great anguish I feel at the untimely death of Booker
Washington. He was my friend who understood me and
believed in me. I did not always believe in him because
I did not understand him. I first saw and heard him
when a junior at Amherst in the early 90's, when he spoke
at Old John Brown's church in Springfield, where I 
journeyed to hear him. I could not then appreciate his
love for the Southern people and his gospel of work. I
<pb id="washi316" n="316"/>
even doubted his loyalty to his race. When I came to
Boston I joined in with his most violent and bitterest
critics. The one thing that I am so thankful for is that
I early saw the light and came to appreciate and 
understand the great work of Booker T. Washington.</p>
          <p>“I have just finished reading an old letter from him,
date, October 1, 1901, in which he said: ‘The main point
of this letter is to say I believe that both you and I are
going to be in a position in the future to serve the race
effectually, and while it is very probable that we shall 
always differ as to detailed methods of lifting up the race,
it seems to me that if we agree in each doing our best to
lift it up the main point will have been gained, and I am
sure that in our anxiety to better the condition of the
race there is no difference between us, and I shall be 
delighted to work in hearty coöperation with you.’</p>
          <p>“Since then, I have known him intimately and well.
He was unselfish and generous to a fault; he was modest
yet masterful; he was quiet yet intense; his common
sense and sagacity seemed uncanny, such was his knowledge 
of human nature. His was a great soul in which no
bitterness or littleness could even find a lurking place.
His was the great heart of Lincoln, with malice toward
none and charity for all. He loved all men and all men
loved him.</p>
          <p>“My humble prayer is that his torch has lighted another
among the dark millions of America, to lead the race 
onward and upward.”</p>
          <p>Booker Washington's insistence that the classrooms,
<pb id="washi317" n="317"/>
shops, and farms were for the development of the students
rather than the students for their development was well
illustrated by a remark he once made to Bishop William
Lawrence of Massachusetts when the Bishop was visiting
the Institute. In reply to Bishop Lawrence's question
as to whether he had chosen the best available land for his
agricultural work, he said, “No, sir, I chose pretty nearly
the poorest land I could find. I chose land on which men
would have to spend all their energies to bring out the
life in the land. They work here under the hardest
conditions. When they go out to other lands—to their
own lands, perhaps—they won't find any worse land to 
till. If they find any better land the difference will be 
all gain for them.”</p>
          <p>Perhaps more remarkable than any or all of his achievements 
was the fact that Booker Washington was a gentleman. 
It would be difficult to find a man who better
conformed to the exacting yet illusive requirements of
that term. He had not only the naturalness and the
goodness of heart which are the fundamentals, but he
had also the breeding and the polish which distinguish
the finished gentleman from the “rough diamond.” This
fact about Booker Washington has been well described
by Hamilton Wright Mabie in an article entitled: “Booker
T. Washington: Gentleman,” in which he says in part:</p>
          <p>“Booker Washington became one of the foremost men
in America; he was heard on great occasions by great 
audiences with profound attention; he was a writer and 
speaker of National position, the founder of a college, and 
the
<pb id="washi318" n="318"/>
organizing leader of a race in ideas and industry. These
were notable achievements; but there was another achievement 
which was in its way more notable. Without any
advantages of birth or station or training, a member of
an ostracized race, with the doors of social life closed in
his face, Dr. Washington was a gentleman. I recall two
illustrations of this quality of nature, often lacking in
men of great ability and usefulness. The first was in
Stafford House, London, the residence of the Duke of
Sutherland. The older Duke was the lifelong friend of
Queen Victoria; and once, when she was going to Stafford
House, she wrote the Duke that she was about to leave
her uninteresting house for his beautiful palace. Nothing
could be more stately than the great hall of Stafford House,
with its two marble stairways ascending to the galleries
above; and when the Duchess of Sutherland, standing on
the dais from which the stairs ascended, received her guests
she reminded more than one of her guests of the splendid
picture drawn by Edmund Burke of Marie Antoinette
moving like a star through the palace of Versailles. On
that evening Dr. Washington was present. At one time
in one of the rooms he happened to be talking with the
duchess and two other women of high rank, two of them
women of great beauty and stateliness. There were some
people present who were evidently very much impressed
by their surroundings. Booker Washington seemed to
be absolutely unconscious of the splendor of the house in
which he was, or of the society in which for the moment
he found himself. Born in a hut without a door-sill, he
<pb id="washi319" n="319"/>
was at ease in the most stately and beautiful private
palace in London.</p>
          <p>“On another occasion there was to be a Tuskegee meeting 
at Bar Harbor. The Casino had been beautifully
decorated for a dance the night before. The harbor was
full of yachts, the tennis courts of fine-looking young men
and women; it was a picture of luxury tempered with
intelligence. Mr. Washington was looking out of the
window. Presently he turned to me and said, with a
smile, ‘And last Wednesday morning I was eating breakfast 
in a shanty in Alabama; there were five of us and
we had one spoon!’”</p>
          <p>At the time of his stay in London, during which this
reception at Stafford House took place, he was given a
luncheon by a group of distinguished men to which Mr.
Asquith, the Prime Minister, was invited. In reply, Mr.
Asquith sent this note:</p>

                  <p>DEAR SIR: I much regret that my engagements do
not allow me to accept your invitation to be present at
the luncheon which it is proposed to give in honor of
Mr. Booker T. Washington. I feel sure, however, that
he will be welcomed with a cordiality which his persistent
and successful labors in the cause of the education of the
American Negro deserve, especially at the hands of English
men, whose difficulties in many parts of the Empire have
been helped toward a solution by the results of his work.</p>

          <pb id="washi320" n="320"/>
          <p>While at home, no matter how pressed and driven with
work, Booker Washington snatched an hour or so every
day for hunting or riding. This daily exercise became a
fetich with him which he clung to with unreasonable
obstinacy. He would frequently set off upon these hunts
or rides in so exhausted a condition that obviously their
only effect could be worse exhaustion. His intense 
admiration for Theodore Roosevelt probably had its 
influence, conscious or unconscious, in strengthening his
devotion to violent outdoor exercise.</p>
          <p>Whatever he was doing or wherever he was, his mind
seemed constantly at work along constructive lines. At
the most unexpected times and places he would suddenly
call the inevitable stenographer and dictate some idea for
an article or address or some plan for the improvement of
Tuskegee or for the betterment of the whole race in this
or that particular. He would sometimes reduce his
immediate subordinates to the verge of despair by pouring 
out upon them in rapid succession constructive suggestions 
each one of which meant hours, days, and even weeks
of time to work out, and then calling for the results of all
before even one could be fairly put into effect. This
tendency became particularly marked in his closing years
when the consciousness of an immense amount of work
to be done and a short and constantly lessening period in
which to do it must have become an obsession and almost
a nightmare to him.</p>
          <p>He would sometimes wound the feelings of acquaintances 
and friends, particularly his teachers, by passing
<pb id="washi321" n="321"/>
them on the street and even looking at them without
recognition. This naturally was not intentional, nor was
it because his mind was wool-gathering, but merely 
because he was thinking out some idea with which the people
and events immediately about him had for the moment
no connection and were consequently totally obliterated
from his consciousness.</p>
          <p>Mr. Washington's strength of will and determination
were never better shown than in the closing hours of his
life. When he was told by his doctors at St. Luke's 
Hospital, New York, whither he had been taken by the New
York trustees of the Institute after his final collapse, that
he had but a few hours to live, he insisted upon starting
for home at once. His physicians expostulated and
warned him that in his condition he could not reasonably
expect to survive the journey. He insisted that he must
go and be true to his oft-repeated assertion, “I was born
in the South, I have lived and labored in the South, and I
expect to die and be buried in the South.” This remark,
when sent out in the Associated Press dispatches 
announcing his death, touched the South as nothing else
could have. No Negro was ever eulogized in the Southern
press as he was. Long accounts of his career and death
with sympathetic and appreciative editorial comments
appeared in most of the Southern papers.</p>
          <p>One of the doctors who was called in to attend him at
the time he was taken to the hospital remarked that it
was “uncanny to see a man up and about who ought by
all the laws of nature to be dead.” In this condition,
<pb id="washi322" n="322"/>
then, he set out upon the long journey from New York to
Tuskegee. When the party reached the Pennsylvania
Station an invalid's chair was awaiting him, but he 
declined to use it, and leaning on the arms of his companions
walked or rather tottered to his seat in the train. As
soon as the train began to move Southward a slight 
invigoration of triumph seemed to come over him which
increased as the journey continued, until at its close he
seemed stronger than when he started. All along the way
he would inquire at frequent intervals what point they
had reached. The reaching and passing of each important
station such as Greensboro, Charlotte, and Atlanta he
would seem to score up in his mind's eye as a new triumph.
And when finally he reached Chehaw, the little station five
miles from Tuskegee, he was fairly trembling with eager
expectancy. As we have said, he reached Tuskegee 
apparently stronger than when he left New York and strong
enough to enjoy the final triumph of his indomitable will
over his overworked and weakened body. The next
morning, November 14, 1915, he was dead.</p>
          <p>Of the myriads of tributes to Booker Washington by
white men and black both North and South, which were
spoken from platforms and pulpits and printed in 
newspapers and periodicals throughout the length and breadth
not only of America but the world, there are two which
we feel irresistibly compelled to use in concluding this
chapter and book. One is the tribute of a former student,
Isaac Fisher, president of the Tuskegee Alumni Association, 
speaking for the graduates at the memorial exercises
<pb id="washi323" n="323"/>
held at Tuskegee on December 12, 1915; the other is
the tribute of one of his teachers, Clement Richardson,
head of the division of English, speaking in effect for the
Tuskegee teachers in an article published in the <hi rend="italics">Survey</hi>
of December 4, 1915.</p>
          <p>At this memorial meeting, after being introduced by Seth
Low, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, as the
representative of the Tuskegee Alumni Association, Mr.
Fisher said:</p>
          <p>“Mr. Chairman: The greatest citizens of this nation have
paused long enough to pay tributes of honor to the memory of
Dr. Washington; and to-night some of the world's most
distinguished citizens are present to say their words of 
love for the departed chieftain whose body lies in a grave 
just outside of those walls. In the presence of these great 
men I do not see why you have asked me, one of the least of 
all, to add my simple praise.</p>
          <p>“But I can say that no persons have sustained so great a
loss as have the members of the Tuskegee Alumni
Association; and I come to bear testimony to the depth and
sincerity of their grief.</p>
          <p>“There is a story which has not yet been told, in connection
with the spread of industrial education in the South and
throughout the entire country. I must tell that story here
before I can make clear just how great is the Alumni's loss.</p>
          <p>“In telling of the spread of industrial education, during the
past twenty-five years, we seem not to know that the work
has been difficult and prosecuted at great sacrifice on 
<pb id="washi324" n="324"/>
the part of the Tuskegee graduates who have sought to
interpret Dr. Washington's theory that economic fitness was
the basis of racial growth in many other directions.</p>
          <p>“The people did not take kindly to this form of education,
believing that it was the same old slavery from which we have
emerged under a new name; and the Tuskegee graduates have
prosecuted their work in the face of the misrepresentations,
prejudice, opposition, and ridicule of those of their own 
race who could or would not understand the spirit of 
industrial education—a spirit broader and finer than the 
phrase suggests. More than this: in the communities where 
they have worked it has been the fashion to permit our 
graduates to do the difficult tasks and carry all the 
burdens of leadership; but if there were any honors to be 
bestowed, they were given to the graduates of other schools.</p>
          <p>“Being human and denied those honors and public marks of
esteem which always gladden the heart, these Tuskegee men
and women have often grown discouraged and have been
tempted to lay down their work. But like Daniel, when those
gloomy hours came, they have turned their faces toward
Jerusalem, to Tuskegee, over which the great spirit of Dr.
Washington brooded and lived; and from this place he has sent
back to them whenever they have called, encouragement,
counsel, and help.</p>
          <p>“Sometimes they have been so depressed that they have
come to Tuskegee just to see and talk with their prophet once
more and to be baptized again in his sweet and noble spirit.
Many times we have seen them here and wondered 
<pb id="washi325" n="325"/>
at their presence. They were here to receive comfort, and
to hear Mr. Washington say in his own convincing manner:
‘It has been my experience that if a man will do the right
thing and go ahead, everything will be all right at last.’
And these men and women who have sat at his feet and
who trusted him have gone back to their work with new
and increasing strength.</p>
          <p>“But now Dr. Washington is gone, and the graduates of
the school will never again receive his counsel and 
encouragement, however gloomy their paths may be. That
is the measure of our loss.</p>
          <p>“And yet our Principal is not buried out yonder. It is
his tired body which is resting just beyond that wall; but he
is not buried in that grave. The real Dr. Washington is
buried in the graduates who sat at his feet and imbibed his
spirit, and he lives in them.</p>
          <p>“King David, pondering over God's mercies and goodness 
to him, thinking of how he had been taken from minding 
sheep and placed upon the throne of Israel; and how
God had guided and protected him and made his name
great in the earth, exclaimed reverently, one day, ‘What
shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits unto me?’
and he answered his question, in part, by saying: ‘I will
pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all the
people.’</p>
          <p>“If all our graduates could speak to-night, they would
have me pay their vows of gratitude for the opportunity to
make blessed and beautiful their lives, given by our great
teacher; and they would have me give public assurance of
<pb id="washi326" n="326"/>
their fealty to the work for which Mr. Washington gave his 
life.</p>
          <p>“And so, Mr. Chairman, in the name of the Alumni
Association and in the spirit of him whose body lies buried 
just beyond those walls, I pledge you and the Trustees the 
loyalty of the Tuskegee graduates to whatever work they are 
called in connection with the realization of Dr. 
Washington's great purpose. I pledge you their support in 
the work which you have come to Tuskegee to perform; because 
we are learning self-government and wish to help prove to 
the world that we can pass the succession to the 
Principalship here without revolution. By this time 
tomorrow night another prophet will have been raised up to 
serve in the room of the great founder of this school. I 
want you, Sir, and the Board of Trustees to know that when 
the proclamation is made that ‘The King is Dead!’ our Alumni 
Association will be ready to reply: ‘Long Live the King!’ 
and we will faithfully, honestly, and loyally support the 
person you elect to succeed our great father, whoever that 
person may be.</p>
          <p>“In the furtherance of Dr. Washington's work, the graduates
stand ready to say:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“‘I'll go where you want me to go, dear Lord,</l>
            <l>O'er the mountain, or plain, or sea;</l>
            <l>I'll say what you want me to say, dear Lord;</l>
            <l>I'll be what you want me to be.’”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>In the <hi rend="italics">Survey</hi> article, after briefly describing the ups and
downs of Mr. Washington's long fight against a breaking
constitution, Mr. Richardson says:</p>
          <pb id="washi327" n="327"/>
          <p>“With such perpetual rallying power who could cope?
A latent feeling crept among many that he was immune to
pain as he had been to insult and abuse. You know he
could steer on over an insult and never see it. Some of us
shook our heads and said, ‘Why he is good for ten years
yet.’ Seeing that he thus defied nerves and baffled pain,
we hoped. It was in the hour of hope that the last stroke
came, and we felt that pulling at the throat which we
should have felt had he gone by sudden accident.</p>
          <p>“How Tuskegee took Dr. Washington's death can
probably best be appreciated by an account of what his
life meant among his teachers. Officially he was a stern
and exacting task master. A tireless worker himself, he
imposed heavy tasks upon others. In the home, however,
he had a genius for cheering by little kindnesses and by a
thoughtful word. Now he would send around a basket of
vegetables from his garden, now a cut of one of his pigs
which he had killed and in which he took great 
delight.</p>
          <p>“People who sent books and pictures to Tuskegee can
hardly realize what a double pleasure they were shipping:
the pleasure they gave him and others through him. He
would have the boxes opened and books and pictures
brought in to his office. Then from all his heaps of 
correspondence, from business engagements, from matters of
national importance, he would turn aside and go through
these himself, culling them out. He would sort a pile here
for this family; one there for another, according to what he
considered would suit each. Many a time one could
<pb id="washi328" n="328"/>
scarcely find a place to step in his office for the 
pictures and books. In all things he received,
but to share.</p>
          <p>“Then he had a way of kicking organizations to pieces for a
few minutes. If some rural school had a creditable exhibit he
would order that the senior class, 150 strong, should be 
taken there, whether it was one mile or ten miles away. He 
would order the class out to see how some poor, illiterate 
farmer had raised a bumper crop of peas, corn, sugar cane, 
and peanuts, how he surrounded himself with conveniences, 
both inside and outside the home. Now he would declare a 
half holiday; now he would allow the students to sleep a 
half-hour later in the morning.</p>
          <p>“In the same way the teachers would get an outing once or
twice a year, sometimes at night, sometimes in the day. As 
the teachers are on duty for both day and night school, and 
as the students usually rise at 5:30 and breakfast at 6, 
these little breaks were windfalls. They sent each one back 
to his labors with a smile. He knew the value of change and 
the psychology of cheer. No wonder then that when death 
closed his eyes both teachers and students went about heavy 
of limb and with eyes that told too plainly what the heart 
felt.</p>
          <p>“Just as he touched the students and teachers with little
thoughtful deeds so he touched the town and State, both white
and black. One feature of his funeral illustrated how 
complete had been his triumph over narrow prejudices. He 
was always talking about the white man up the hollow, back 
in the woods. How many times have I heard him urge 
picturesquely upon gatherings of teachers 
<pb id="washi329" n="329"/>
to ‘win that old fellow who, when you begin to talk Negro
education and Negro schoolhouse, scratches his head, leans
to one side, and looks far away. That's the man,’ he
would say, ‘that you've got to convince that Negro
education is not a farce.’</p>
          <p>“Well, that man was at Booker T. Washington's
funeral. He came there on foot, on horseback, in buggies, 
in wagons. He was there in working clothes, in
slouched hat, with no collar.</p>
          <p>“During the service I chanced to stand near the end of
the platform. Pretty soon I felt a rough brushing against
my elbow. As I turned I saw a small white child, poorly
clad, being thrust upon the end of the flower-laden 
platform. Then followed an old white man, collarless, wearing
a dingy blue shirt and a coat somewhat tattered. After
him came two strapping fellows, apparently his sons. All
grouped themselves there and listened eagerly, freely
spitting their tobacco juice on the platform steps and on
the floor.</p>
          <p>“How thankful would Dr. Washington have been for
their presence. What a triumph! Ten years ago those
men would not stop at the school. They cursed it, cursed
the whole system and the man at the head of it. But
quietly, persistently, he had gone on with that everlasting
doctrine that service can win even the meanest heart, that
an institution had the right to survive in just so far as it
dovetailed its life into the life of all the people. 
Beautiful to behold, to remember forever; there was no race 
and no class in the Tuskegee chapel on Wednesday morning,
<pb id="washi330" n="330"/>
November 17th; heart went out to heart that a common
friend had gone.</p>
          <p>“Broken as everybody is over the loss, no one is afraid.
No panic as to the future of the school disturbs the breasts
of the 190 odd teachers here. In the first place, poor as
most of us are, we are ready to suffer many a privation 
before we see the institution slip back the slightest 
fraction of an inch. All these years it has been on trial, 
on record. It has been a test, not of a mere school, but of 
a race. A tacit pledge—not a word has thus far been 
spoken—has gone out among us that it shall remain on 
record, that it shall stand here as a breathing evidence 
that Negroes can bring things to pass.</p>
          <p>“Back of this is the unshaken faith in our Board of
Trustees. I doubt if such another board exists. It
is made up of white men and black men, of men of the
North and men of the South. There is not a figurehead 
among them. Though intensely engaged they go into the
details of the workings of the school, getting close to the
inner workings and to the lives of the teachers and
students.</p>
          <p>“Finally, we are confident that the public will have a
good deal to say before Tuskegee is let die. The beaten
path has been made to her door. Her methods have not
only been commended but adopted wholly or in part both
in this country and in other lands. Her use is undisputed.
She takes students almost literally out of the gutter, puts
them on their feet, and sends them out honest, peaceful,
useful citizens. This is the ideal for which Dr. Washington
<pb id="washi331" n="331"/>
struggled, and over which his life-cord snapped too
soon.</p>
          <p>“For the same ideal the people at Tuskegee, though
broken in spirit, are willing to spend themselves; for they
are confident that their cause is just and that the world is
with them.”</p>
