        <head>PREFACE.</head>
        <p>This little volume contains, in story form, a brief outline of the
history of the Negro. In collating the facts herein set forth it was my
privilege to consult the Congressional Library at Washington, the
libraries of Harvard and Yale universities and the Boston Public
Library. I am fully aware that such opportunities should have insured
a better book, but I earnestly hope that the motive which prompts me
may cause the shortcomings and imperfections of the work to be
forgiven.</p>
        <p>I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to the following authors:

        <p>In presenting this narrative, as a sort of “family story” to the colored
children of America, it is my fervent hope that they may hereby acquire
such an earnest desire for greater information as shall compellingly lead
them, in maturer years, to the many comprehensive and erudite volumes
which have been written upon this subject.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
          <head>A TALK WITH THE CHILDREN.</head>
          <p>MOST girls and boys, who are from twelve to fourteen years old can
tell, if one should ask them, many interesting things about
America, the country in which we live and
most children whose foreparents came from Europe or Asia have
been taught to love those countries just because their kinfolk once
lived there. Many little colored children can draw a map of Africa, tell
some of its products and describe some of its people; I wonder how
many have been taught to think of Africa with interest and affection,
because our great, great grandparents came from that continent?
Perhaps if we talk awhile about our Motherland and some of the
notable things which have happened there, we shall all learn to love
that wonderful country and be proud of it.</p>
          <p>In these talks, though sometimes the adjective “colored” will be
used just as the word “white” is frequently made use of, we shall, as
a rule speak of ourselves as “Negroes” and always begin the noun
with a capital letter. It is true that the word Negro is considered by
some a term of contempt and for that reason, many of us wince at it;
but history tells us that when England had been conquered by the
Normans, centuries ago, and the Norman barons were beating,
starving and killing the natives, the name “Englishman” was
considered an abusive term, and the greatest insult one Norman
could offer another was to call him an “Englishman.” You know that
now all who claim England as home are justly proud of it, and no
Englishman is ashamed of that name.</p>
          <p>If history repeats itself, as we are often told it does, the time will
come when our whole race will feel it an honor to be called
“Negroes.” Let us each keep that hope before us and hasten
<pb id="pendle6" n="6"/>
the time by living so that those who know us best will respect us
most; surely then those who follow will be proud of our memory and
of our race-name.</p>
          <p>There are some of us who feel that, pitifully small though it be, we
have given the very best and done the very most it is possible for us
to give and to do for the race, and we are looking to you, dear
children, to perform the things which we, in our youth had hoped
and planned. We beg that you will not fail us. In order to realize our
hopes for you, there is one thing which you must do: While you are
still too young to be earning money, while you are yet at the
beginning of your education, you, each, may be building up a
strong and beautiful character, an honest, truthful, brave and
upright character; it is THE ESSENTIAL thing and without it either
money or education or both will be worse than wasted.</p>
          <p>After leaving Africa we shall take a glance at the past and the
present of the Negro in other lands, especially in our own country
of America.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
          <head>GEOGRAPHY OF AFRICA.</head>
          <p>LET us look at a map of the Eastern Hemisphere. In the northern part
we see Europe and Asia, and southwest of these lies Africa,
almost entirely in the Torrid Zone. As vast as is the United
States, the continent of Africa contains more than three times as
many square miles. In the northeastern part of Africa we see Egypt,
moving westward we come to what are called the Barbary 
States—Tripoli, Fezzan, Tunis and Morocco. Remember these countries,
for on their soil many of the most important events of the ancient
world took place. Some hundreds of years before our Saviour was
born in Bethlehem, hundreds of years before men had even heard
the names “England,” “France,” “Germany,” “America,” the
people of northern Africa were engaged in building cities, sailing
the waters and rearing statues and monuments, some of which
latter are standing until this day.</p>
          <p>Let us now start from Alexandria in Egypt on the Mediterranean
Sea and sail down the east coast of Africa. We may touch the coasts
of Nubia, Eritrea, French Somali coast, British Somaliland, Italian
Somaliland, British East Africa, German East Africa, Portuguese East
Africa, Transvaal, Natal, and at the southernmost part of the
continent we find Cape Colony, while jutting out from the very tip
of Cape Colony is the famous Cape of Good Hope. And now we
start up the west coast passing German Southwest Africa, Angola,
French Congo, Kamerun, Nigeria, Dahomey, Ashanti, French West
Africa, Liberia, Sierra Leone, French and Portuguese Guinea, British
Gambia, Rio de Ora, and so back to the Barbary States and Egypt.</p>
          <p>In our travels we sailed through the Suez Canal, which cuts Africa
off from Asia and makes of it an island continent; down the Red Sea
where Pharaoh and his army were drowned; through the Gulf of
Aden; down the Indian Ocean; through
<pb id="pendle10" n="10"/>
the Mozambique Channel, which separates Africa and the island of
Madagascar; around Cape Good Hope, where the winds and the
waves have made it very dangerous for us; up the South Atlantic
Ocean; through the Gulf of Guinea; into the Atlantic again, and
through the Strait of Gibraltar. On the north coast of Gibraltar stands
the great rock considered by the ancients the western boundary of
the world and prized by the English who now own it as one of their
most important possessions. Leaving Gibraltar we find ourselves
again in the Mediterranean and back to Egypt. While sailing up the
South Atlantic and passing southern Angola, we should have taken
a long look directly out to sea, for in that direction but more than one
thousand miles away lies the little island of St. Helena where
Napoleon Bonapart was held prisoner and where he died.</p>
          <p>But with all this travelling we have seen nothing of the great heart
of Africa, which in ancient times was sometimes called Libya,
sometimes Ethiopia, where dwell millions of people, thousands of
wild animals, fruits and vegetables in greatest profusion and where
many of the articles highly prized by civilized man are to be found in
abundance—diamonds, gold, ivory, india rubber, ebony, ostrich
feathers and many other valuable articles. Among the native animals
of Africa are elephants, lions, monkeys, snakes of many kinds,
leopards, camels, <sic corr="giraffes">giraffs</sic>, gorillas, wolves, jackals, hyenas, zebras,
<sic corr="rhinoceros">rhinosceros</sic>, buffalos, and many species of birds of beautiful
plumage. How would our “zoos” and our circuses manage if it were
not for Africa? In some parts of Africa sugar cane, cotton and the
coffee plant grow wild and beside these apples, peaches, plums,
grapes, pomegranates, dates, spices, cereals, melons, gourds,
cocoanuts and many other fruits and vegetables are to be found.</p>
          <p>Looking again at the map we see just below the northern countries
and stretching from east to west almost the entire width of the
continent, the Sahara and Libyan deserts—the greatest in the world.
Below these lies the Soudan, farther
<pb id="pendle11" n="11"/>
south and crossed by the Equator is the Congo Free State, which is
anything but free; while still farther south we find Matabele and the
Transvaal. I hope you will remember the location of the different
countries of Africa, for we shall speak of many of them again.</p>
          <p>There are many deserts in Africa but the Sahara is the greatest of
them all. As you know, a desert is a large tract of land where the
ground is sandy, patched and dry and where rain seldom or never
falls. In Sahara, which is 1,000 miles wide and 2,000 miles long, the
sand is almost always moving and when the fierce windstorms arise,
as they frequently do, the sand is blown about in huge billows like
the waves of the ocean, and the camel, which has been called “the
ship of the desert” is the only beast of burden which can cross the
dreadful wastes. The few underground springs scattered here and
there, sustain grass and bushes as far around them as their moisture
reaches. These green and fertile spots are called oases and they are
the only places in the desert where men and beasts can obtain rest
and refreshment. Anyone who attempts to cross Sahara may expect
many hardships—thousands have lost their lives in the attempt. So
here we have one reason why not many of the ancient civilized
Africans went southward for any purpose.</p>
          <p>Indeed the whole of Africa was and is little suited for comfortable
traveling. The rivers contain many rapids, waterfalls, etc., which
cause them to be in some places almost entirely unnavigable. All
kinds of vegetation flourish in this tropical country; swamps and
jungles abound, especially in central Africa, and its mountains are
covered with dense forests. The climate which is very hot and
enervating makes travelling quite unpleasant aside from the other
drawbacks, and so, for hundreds of years very few serious attempts
were made to find out just what kind of country Africa really was.</p>
          <p>In modern times much has been done toward making a journey in
Africa more agreeable. Many miles of railroad have been laid in
different parts of the continent; there is one
<pb id="pendle12" n="12"/>
road running for some hundreds of miles across the Libyan desert,
and another from the coast of British East Africa to Victoria Nyanza,
while a road from the Cape to Cairo has long been planned.</p>
          <p>The Congo, the Niger, and the Nile are the three great rivers of
Africa; the Nile, wonderful and mysterious, comes up out of the
central part of the continent through Egypt and empties into the
Mediterranean Sea. Though long it is at ordinary times but a narrow
river, yet every year it overflows its banks flooding the surrounding
country; but it is a kindly flood for it fertilizes the soil and the
prosperity of each successive season depends upon “Father Nile.”
The Niger flows through the northwestern part of Africa and the
Congo through the southwestern part.</p>
          <p>In its Nile and its Sahara, in its climate, in its jungles and its
mountains, in its wild animals, its vegetable products and articles of
value in commerce Africa stands alone and unrivaled.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
          <head>ANCIENT CIVILIZATION.</head>
          <p>THOUSANDS of years ago, far up the river Nile and near
the modern Senaar, flourished the Ethiopian kingdom
of Meroe. Many statues and monuments have been
unearthed in this region from time to time, and it is from the
<figure id="ill2" entity="pendl13"><p>ANCIENT CIVILIZATION</p></figure>writings, pictures and carvings upon these that most of our
knowledge of this ancient country comes.</p>
          <p>These statues were erected to the idols or gods whom the people
worshipped because they did not know the true God; the monuments
were built with passages and chambers and were used as temples for
the worship of their gods; so while no trace is now found of the
dwellings of the people their
<pb id="pendle14" n="14"/>
temples covered with pictures show plainly their manner of living and
of worship as well as many other things of interest.</p>
          <p>The city called Meroe was the seat of government, or as we say in
these days the capital, and the rulers were chosen from among the
priests. Some very interesting things are told of the manner of
choosing a king and the rules by which he was governed. As in most
ancient countries, the men who were by nature the cleverest made
themselves priests and whenever a new king was selected, they
pretended their gods had selected him. As soon as the choice was
made known the people fell down before the king and gave him all
honor. He was beautifully clothed and given great power but he
could not go beyond what the laws of the country allowed, so that
Meroe was what is called a limited or constitutional monarchy.</p>
          <p>When the priests felt that the king had reigned long enough, they
sent to him a messenger with the emblem of death; as soon as the
poor king saw this emblem he was compelled to retire at once and kill
himself. So you see that even in those days to be a king was not
always to be either safe or happy.</p>
          <p>The city of Meroe was a lively, bustling place, for its streets were
crowded with caravans bringing in from the surrounding regions,
gold, silver, copper, salt, iron, frankincense, etc. These articles were
sent down to Egypt and along with them went ideas which were even
more valuable than the articles of commerce. The Egyptians enlarged
upon and continued the civilization which was begun in Ethiopia,
especially in the kingdom of Meroe and even the pyramids of Egypt
are merely larger and elaborated copies of those whose remains are
dug up around the site of Meroe.</p>
          <p>Remember that in this old, old kingdom king and court, priests and
worshipers, merchants and householders were Negroes.</p>
          <p>On both sides of the Nile have been found the ruins of ancient
cities, at least twenty on either side, and learned men have taken
great pleasure in bringing to light the buried evidences of what was
once the busiest and most prosperous part
<pb id="pendle15" n="15"/>
of the world; these ruins stretch from beyond Meroe down to Egypt.
We shall be able to take, here, but a glance at Egypt for you may find
many books on that country. Many persons have devoted their lives
to the study of ancient Egypt, and it has been made so important a
branch of human knowledge as to have a name of its own—Egyptology.</p>
          <p>Some historians tell us very plainly that the Egyptians were not
Africans at all and so Negroes need not be proud of what they did,
but it is not reasonable to suppose that the natives had obligingly
left that most fertile region uninhabited to await the coming of
strangers and as there is so much uncertainty as to whom the
Egyptians were and whence they came and as to which were Negroes
and which were Egyptians proper in those dim and distant days, it is
just as well to believe that we were and are all related though we
cannot tell exactly the degree of our cousinship.</p>
          <p>Alexandria in Egypt contained the largest and most remarkable
library of the ancient world, for that city was the seat of learning and
culture. This library, gathered through hundreds of years before the
advent of Christ, by the rulers of Egypt was burnt when the fleet of
Julius Cæsar caught fire in the harbor. If any books escaped, or were
subsequently replaced they must have perished when the whole
quarter of the city was burnt by Aurelian.</p>
          <p>While the destruction of the library was a tremendous loss to the
whole human family, the Negro was by far the heaviest loser; for
there can be no doubt that many now disputed points of race origin,
relationship, and achievement might have been settled by the facts
recorded upon the parchments and scrolls with which the shelves of
the Alexandrian Library were filled.</p>
          <p>It is very certain that the Egyptians and other peoples of northern
Africa were, as has been said, far ahead of the rest of the continent,
but nevertheless it is also certain that the neighboring countries of
Europe obtained their first instruction in the arts and sciences and
received their first ideas of a written language from what has been in
modern times called
<pb id="pendle16" n="16"/>
the Dark Continent, but which was in olden days a light which
lighted the world. Civilization moved northward into Europe rather
than southward into the heart of Africa for the reason that travel in
the interior, on account of the jungles, deserts, mountains, swamps
and ravines, was unsafe and uncomfortable.</p>
          <p>The most ancient rulers of Egypt were called Pharaohs and they
governed the country for hundreds of years. A Pharaoh was ruling
when Joseph was sold by his brothers into Egypt and another
Pharaoh reigned when the Jews, who had been held in bondage
many years, were led by Moses out of the country over the Red Sea
into the Promised Land in Asia. The Persians conquered the country
about 520 B. C.; after them it was ruled by Alexander the Great; next
by a line of kings called Ptolmies; then by Rome; next by the Mohammedans
and today it is largely under the government of England. Egypt played a
wonderful and important part in the world's history for thousands
of years. It was to this country that the child Jesus was
carried to be saved from wicked King Herod who would have
killed him. There is near the site of ancient Heliopolis, the
City of the Sun, a sycamore tree about which the legend runs
that it once sheltered the Holy Family; here, also, at Heliopolis,
it is said that Moses taught and Jeremiah wrote.</p>
          <p>It was when Alexandria was the fountain of the learning of the
ancient world that the Christian religion took root in northern Africa,
There were men from Africa present in Jerusalem on the Day of
Pentecost, when hundreds testified to the wonderful works of God,
each in his own tongue. These men and others first took the Gospel
to Africa, and it flourished there unhindered for nearly three
centuries, but while Diocletian was Emperor of Rome, Christians
suffered great persecution.</p>
          <p>In the Church in Africa, as elsewhere, many died—young girls and
women among them—rather than betray their faith. “Among those
who thus perished was Leonidas, the father of Origon, Potimicæna,
who was put to death by being slowly dipped into burning pitch;
Felicitas, a beautiful slave girl, who
<pb id="pendle17" n="17"/>
was torn to pieces by wild beasts; Perpetua, a young woman of
high birth, and many others.”</p>
          <p>When Constantine became Emperor, these persecutions ceased,
but, as you see, African Christians had their share in the glory of
martyrdom.</p>
          <p>You have all heard of the great pyramids of Egypt built in a time
so far distant that no one knows just how old they are.
Other structures of interest are the Sphynx, the catacombs and the
labyrinth. The labyrinth is built or hewn out of marble, is partly
underground and is said to have comprised twelve palaces and
3,000 chambers.</p>
          <p>Abyssinia is another African country of great antiquity. It is a very
mountainous country and its climate is peculiar, for though so near
the equator the earth never becomes warm, but is always damp and
chilly while the nights fall suddenly and are very cold. This is
because the country is so high above the level of the sea.</p>
          <p>The Abyssinians claim that their country is the Sheba whose
queen journeyed to the court of King Solomon to behold its glory
and to learn of the wisdom of the great king. It is said that she was
converted to the Jewish faith and that her people believed in the true
God long <sic corr="before">befor</sic> Christ came, and it is known that Christianity was
established in Abyssinia before 350 A. D.</p>
          <p>Carthage, which flourished near modern Tunis, was one of the
richest and most important states of the ancient world. It was
founded by Phoenicians and at first these paid a yearly tax to the
native Africans who owned the soil, but just as soon as the colonists
grew strong enough they waged war against the Africans and
finally conquered them. The natives were driven back into the interior
where they were cruelly treated, heavily burdened by taxation and
forced to till the soil for their <sic corr="conquerors">conquerers</sic>.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the settlers were marrying the native woman and there
arose a race known as Afro-Phoenicians or Liby-Phoenicians. They
became very numerous and were an important
<pb id="pendle18" n="18"/>
factor in the country, many of them becoming colonists, in their
turn, and settling in other countries. Some settled in Spain and at one
time 30,000 of the Afro-Phoenicians emigrated from Carthage and
settled on the west coast of Africa south of the Straits of Gibraltar.</p>
          <p>The Carthagenians were a seafaring people and their trading vessels
went to northern Europe, western Africa, and, it is supposed, as far
as the Azores. They planted colonies in many countries and are said
to have worked the tin mines of Cornwall in Wales. The Carthegenian
navy was for long the most powerful in the ancient world, and “the
waters of every sea were white with her sails.”</p>
          <p>Finally, a great rivalry arose between Carthage and Rome and after
a time these two countries went to war. For the space of nearly one
hundred and twenty-five years these countries were enemies. There
was first war, then peace between them, but in 146 B. C. Rome
conquered and many thousands of the Carthagenians were killed by
the sword or buried under the burning ruins of their homes; the
remainder were sold into slavery, the Romans razed what was left of
the city to the ground, plowed up the, earth and sowed salt in the
furrows as a sign of utter desolation. Hannibal, the great general, was
a Carthagenian who did his part in his country's service. He won
many great victories and finally killed himself rather than fall into the
hands of the enemy.</p>
          <p>All the pomp and pride of these ancient countries, their wealth and
power, the things for which they killed themselves or killed each
other have melted into nothingness, have become “as a tale that is
told.” Yet we learn from their story how important a part Africa
played in ancient times.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
          <head>EXPLORATIONS IN AFRICA.</head>
          <p>The interior of Africa has always abounded in those things
which civilized men prize and the earliest explorers
were seeking for articles of value to commerce. Beside
these, the Egyptians sent out many hunters for the elephants
so useful in their wars and the Romans paid good prices for
lions and other wild beasts for their arenas and circuses. These<figure id="ill3" entity="pendl19"><p>RIONGA, A NATIVE CHIEF, RECEIVES BAKER</p></figure>
ancient explorers and more modern ones also brought wonderful tales
of the creatures they claimed to have seen, creatures which never
existed anywhere, such as dragons, griffins, headless men and so
forth. Such tales did not serve to make men anxious to enter Africa.</p>
          <p>Then Arabs, however, as missionaries or as traders, have, for
centuries, been familiar with the interior of this great continent.
Arabian missionaries converted many tribes to the
<pb id="pendle20" n="20"/>
Mohammedan faith, and even before the rise of Mohammedanism,
“Negroes shared in the learning and politics of Arabia.” Travelers in
the interior of Africa have often been astonished at the number of
natives who could read and write the Arabic language; hundreds of
them know many passages of the Koran (the Mohammedan Bible)
and can repeat them from memory as well as extracts from other
Arabic writings.</p>
          <p>The Arab traders early penetrated far into the country seeking for
the articles in <sic corr="themselves">themselvs</sic> so valueless to Africa but worth so much
money in other countries. They also hunted the natives whom they
kidnapped and sold into slavery. Selfishness, cruelty and treachery
were the lessons they taught and the early white traders and later
ones, too, did very little better. One writer says of the latter that “a
white man to the natives of Africa stood for wrong and cruelty alone.
The very word meant separation of wives and husbands, parents
and children to be carried to a fate as mysterious as it proved to be
horrible. Hence the white man's greed and cruelty was a bar to his
curiosity and energy; his love of knowledge and science was
defeated by his love of sin and wrong, and the civilized world,
instead of wondering at the ignorance and barbarity that kept back
for so long a time, all efforts to know and to help should wonder that
anyone from the outside world should have been allowed to live for a
day where these wronged, outraged savages ruled.”</p>
          <p>But with all that Africa has suffered, and, in some places, is still
suffering at the hands of so-called civilized men, there have been
brave, noble men and women who have devoted the best years of
their lives to Africa and some have finally died a martyr's death at the
hands of those whom they were trying to help.</p>
          <p>One of the first of these was Mungo Park, a native of Scotland. In
1795, when he was only twenty-four years old, he went to West
Africa to try to find the source, or beginning of the River Niger. One
of the drawbacks to the west coast is its deadly climate, and shortly
after arriving at Kano young
<pb id="pendle21" n="21"/>
Park fell ill of fever and remained an invalid for five months. While
recovering, he learned the language of the Mandingoes, a native
tribe, and this was a great help to him.</p>
          <p>He finally started with only six natives on his journey. Had he been
older and wiser he would have taken a larger company. At one time
they were captured by Moors and a wild boar was <sic corr="turned">turnd</sic> loose upon
them, but instead of attacking Park the beast turned upon his owners,
and this aroused their superstitious fears. The king then ordered him
to be put in a hut where the boar was tied while he and his chief
officers discussed whether Park should lose his right hand, his eyes
or his life. But he escaped from them, and after nearly two years of
wandering in search of the Niger's source, during which time he
suffered many hardships and made many narrow escapes he returned
to Kano, the place where he had been ill.</p>
          <p>At one time during his journey Mr. Park arrived in the
neighborhood of Sego and as a white man had never been seen
in that region before, the natives looked upon him with fear and
astonishment. He asked to see the king, but no one would take him
across the river, and the king sent word that he would by no means
receive the strange traveler until he knew what the latter wanted. Park
was tired, hungry and discouraged and was preparing to spend the
night in the branches of a tree when a native woman pitied him. She
invited him into her hut, and with the hospitality for which the
natives are noted, shared with him her food. By signs she made him
understand that he might occupy the sleeping mat and as she and
her daughters sat spinning they sang their native songs, among them
the following which was impromptu and composed in honor of the
stranger:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <lg>
              <l>The wind roared and the rain fell.</l>
              <l>The poor white man, faint and weary, came and sat under our tree.</l>
              <l>He has no mother to bring him milk; no wife to grind his corn.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Chorus.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Let us pity the white man;</l>
              <l>No mother has he to bring him milk;</l>
              <l>No wife to grind his corn.</l>
            </lg>
          </lg>
          <pb id="pendle22" n="22"/>
          <p>Speaking of this incident Park says: “Trifling as this recital may
appear to the reader, to a person in my situation the circumstance
was affecting in the highest degree. I was oppressed by such
unexpected kindness and sleep fled from my eyes. Another writer
says: “The name of the woman and the alabaster box of precious
ointment, the nameless widow, who, giving only two mites, had given
more than all the rich, and this nameless woman of Sego, form a trio
of feminine beauty and grandeur of which the sex in all ages may be
proud.”</p>
          <p>Mungo Park went from Kano back to England and as every one
had thought him dead long ago his return caused great rejoicing
throughout the country. Eight years afterward he went again to
Africa on the same errand and with quite a company, but one by one
his companions sickened and died and finally, though having
traveled many miles and endured much suffering, Park himself was
drowned while trying to escape from the natives and without coming
in sight of the Niger's source.</p>
          <p>David Livingstone was also of Scotland and was born about eight
years after Park died. His parents were poor, and as he was compelled
to work in the day, he received his early education at a night school.
He was of a serious turn and while quite young decided to give his
life to the cause of missions. In 1840, at the age of twenty-seven he
went to South Africa where for nine years he preached and taught at
various stations in the vicinity of, Cape Town; he also sent to England
during this time much information of value to geographers
and scientists.</p>
          <p>At length he started into the interior on a journey of discovery,
realizing, as we all finally do, that by a true, sincere and unselfish life
he might point the way to God no matter where he was nor what his
occupation. And so, for years, he devoted himself to the double
cause of religion and discovery.</p>
          <p>Sometimes for months and again for years there would be no word
from him and upon two or three occasions searching
<pb id="pendle23" n="23"/>
parties were sent out to find him. He traveled thousands of miles and
made many discoveries and though he sometimes met hostile tribes
who would engage him and his followers in battle, because they did
not know how good and kind he was, wherever they had the chance
to really know him they became his true friends. His native servants
were devoted to him and among other things he taught them English.
Chumah and Susi were the names of two who rendered him valuable
assistance.</p>
          <p>During his travels he went one time from Cape Colony up to the
northwestern part of what is now Matebele; another time he went
much farther north and discovered Lake Nyassa; with Stanley he
sailed up to the northern end of Lake Tanganyika and his last trip was made
to Lake Bangeola, where he had been once before. Here he fell sick
and died.</p>
          <p>His wife had died in Africa about ten years before and he had
hoped after exploring the region around Bangeola to return to
England and spend his last days with his children; but, alas, this
was not to be. Those who were with him when he died embalmed his
body as best they could and at last succeeded in carrying it to
Zanzibar. Here it was received by a government vessel and carried to
England, and Livingstone was buried with the honor he deserved in
Westminster Abby.</p>
          <p>Samuel White Baker, an English explorer of note, had traveled
much in Asia and Africa and in 1864 had discovered Albert Nyanza or
Lake Victoria Nyanza had previously been discovered by two
explorers—Speke and Grant. In 1869, Baker with his wife and a large
company which included soldiers sailors, a physician, engineers,
carpenters and other trained men, started from Egypt, with the
consent of the Khedive or king for the purpose of establishing
honest trade with the natives instead of the cheating system and also
to break up the slave trade as far south as possible. His plan was to
reach the interior by means of the Nile and its branches and he took
along several vessels, some of these were in pieces to be put together
when needed.</p>
          <p>You must remember that these explorers had nothing to
<pb id="pendle24" n="24"/>
guide them and that they were making a map not only for themselves
but for the rest of the world. They never knew one day through what
sort of country they would be traveling next nor whether the natives
would be friends or enemies.</p>
          <p>On this trip, after sailing for over a month through waters
sometimes so covered with vegetation that the men were compelled
to swim ahead and cut a canal for the boats with their swords,
through waters filled with crocodiles which kept the men in constant
fear, through waters in which were many hippotami which sometimes
upset the small boats and broke holes in the large ones, Baker and his
party were compelled to return to the Nile proper because the water
became too shallow to float the boats. But he and his companions
would not give up and after resting a while, set out once more.</p>
          <p>On the way to Fatiko, the home of Abou Saood and the hotbed
of slavery, they met hostile tribes of natives, and the Arabs
who made their living by selling slaves, set many traps for
them. After much hardship, suffering hunger and thirst,
lack of clothing, the burning of their camp and many other
losses, they succeeded in conquering their enemies and Baker
and his party had the happiness of knowing that their trials had
not been in vain. The slave station of Abou Saood was completely
broken up and that cruel, wicked man left for Cairo
saying that he had been wrongfully treated and would enter a
complaint against Baker at the court of the Khedive. However,
for the time being, at least, the slave trade throughout
the entire region through which Baker had passed and down
to the equator no longer existed; the natives returned to their
homes and began once more to till the soil.</p>
          <p>Henry M. Stanley has been called the most successful explorer of
modern times. He made three separate trips into the heart of Africa,
each of which was entirely successful, though at the cost of many
lives.</p>
          <p>His first trip, made in 1870, was for the purpose of finding
Livingstone, his second was for the purpose of carrying forward the
work which Livingstone had not been able to finish;
<pb id="pendle25" n="25"/>
at this time Stanley explored Lake Victoria and proved it to be one of
the sources of the Nile. His last trip was for the relief of Emin Pasha,
who after being appointed governor of a province in the interior had
been surrounded by hostile natives.</p>
          <p>He published to the world many interesting and wonderful
facts about the country and inhabitants of Africa. Money, at
that time was of no use in the heart of Africa and food and
other necessaries were exchanged for beads, bells, wire, cloth
and such other things as the natives could not make. More
than once life hung on a string of beads or a yard of cloth.</p>
          <p>If you have imagined that all of the native Africans resemble the
pictures of such usually placed in school books you are greatly
mistaken, for, according to Stanley there is as much difference in
color, features and character between the tribes of Africa as between
the various nations of Europe. Some African tribes are of lighter or
darker brown, some are black, some resemble what are called
mulatoes, and there is a tribe living on Mt. Gambaragara, near Victoria
Nyanza members of which were seen by both Livingstone and
Stanley and who are as fair as Europeans with brown hair. “The
Wahumba, is a fine well-formed race, the mouth exceedingly well cut,
delicately small; the nose that of the Greeks, limbs long, shapely and
clean as those of the antelope. Their robes of calf and goat skins
hang from the shoulders and fall to the knees.” “The Wadoe is a
warlike intelligent people living in a picturesque country. On account
of their superior physique and intelligence they are eagerly sought
for as slaves by the cruel Arabs.” “The Wagogo, a sturdy native
with his rich complexion, his lion front, menacing aspect, bullying
nature, haughty, proud and quarrelsome, is a mere child with a man
who will study his nature and not offend his vanity. He believes in
God or the Sky Spirit and his prayers are generally directed to Him
when parents die.” In the course of his journeyings Stanley saw
many beautiful native women and many dignified and handsome men.</p>
          <pb id="pendle26" n="26"/>
          <p>King Ruoma was, perhaps one of the most positive native
characters with whom this explorer came in contact. Hearing that
Stanley was about to cross his territory the king sent the following
message: “Ruoma sends salaams to the white man. He does not want
the white man's cloth, beads or wire, but the white man must not pass
through his country. Ruoma does not want to see him or any other
man with long red hair down to his shoulders, white face and big red
eyes. Ruoma is not afraid of him, but if the white man will come near
his country, <sic corr="Ruoma">Rouma</sic> and Mirambo will fight him.” Stanley did not lead
his company across <sic corr="Ruoma's">Rouma's</sic> territory.</p>
          <p>Ruling over Uganda, the country next to <sic corr="Ruoma">Rouma</sic>, was the powerful
King Mtesa, one of the finest native characters mentioned by
explorers. Mtesa is described as a “tall and slender man, but with
broad powerful shoulders. His eyes were large, his face intelligent
and amiable while his mouth and nose were like those of a Persian
Arab. As soon as he began to speak, Stanley was captivated by his
courteous , amiable manner. He was infinitely superior to the Sultan
of Zanzibar, and impressed one as a colored gentleman who had
learned his manners by contact with <sic corr="civilized,">cilivized,</sic> cultured men, instead
of being, as he was, a native of Central Africa who had never seen
but three white men before in his life. Stanley was astonished at his
native polish.”</p>
          <p>Mtesa had been converted to Mohammedanism by an Arab but
soon agreed to observe the Christian as well as the Moslem Sabbath.
He also caused the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, and the
Golden Rule to be written on a board that he might read them daily.
Under his government, Uganda was a happy, prosperous country.</p>
          <p>In addition to the foregoing several other explorers have done
good work in Africa; but these are mentioned that you may form a
general idea as to what has been accomplished along this line.</p>
          <p>It is said that more than seven hundred explorers have traveled in
Africa and of that number fully five hundred have found there their
last resting place. Of the missionaries, both
men and women who have died in Africa, there is a long roll.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
          <head>MODERN AFRICA.</head>
          <p>IN MODERN times Africa has been little more than a big,
rich <sic corr="grab-bag">grabbag</sic> for the great powers of the world. By might not by right
have they divided her territory among them, and small indeed is the
portion to which the natives may lay claim. Thoughtful people agree
that there are two reasons for this state of affairs. First, the lack of
unity, or oneness among native Africans, which is the most
important reason, and second, inferior knowledge of modern warfare
and lack of modern arms. Says one English writer, “No single
separate African race or tribe has yet felt anything like unity with the
black race in general; otherwise Europe and Asia could not continue
to govern Africa.” As it is, England, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal,
Belgium and Turkey claim large portions of African soil.</p>
          <p>Friends of Africa have often been discouraged by some of the
barriers to progress which have been unnecessarily placed in the
way. A white American missionary has recently written: “I wonder
that the Africans do not shoot with poisoned arrows, every white
man that lands on their coast, for he has brought them rum, and is
still bringing it; and in a few decades more, if the rum traffic
continues, there will be few left in Africa to be saved. The vile rum, in
that tropical climate, is depopulating the country more rapidly than
famine, pestilence and war. Africa, with the simple gospel of Jesus is
saved, but Africa with rum is eternally lost.”</p>
          <p>In modern times there have been a few of the native kingdoms
which have attracted the attention of the world by their tribal unity
and their ability to resist the stealthy advance of civilized nations.
The Ashantis first came under European notice in the early part of
the eighteenth century. King Osai Tutu, who founded the nation,
brought into union several neighboring tribes, by means of warfare
or by tactful management. He was slain in 1731. The Ashantis kept up a constant
<pb id="pendle28" n="28"/>
war with the neighboring Fantis, and when the latter sought British
protection, the Ashantis fought against them both, with varying
fortunes, for many years.</p>
          <p>In the war of 1896, the English won and King Prempeh surrendered
and was exiled. “Though outwardly submissive, the chiefs of
Kumasi, the principal tribe, were far from reconciled to British rule,
and in 1900 a serious rebellion broke out in the Kumasi, Adansi, and
Kokofu tribes. Rebellion was crushed and Ashanti formally joined to
the British dominions and given a separate administration under
control of the governor of the Gold Coast. It was reported, in 1905,
that the Ashantis were becoming reconciled to the English and that
the maintenance of the tribal system, and the support given to the
lawful chiefs, did much to win the confidence and respect of a people
naturally suspicions, and mindful of their exiled king.”</p>
          <p>Yorubaland is a large tract in the hinterland of Lagos, West
Africa. The Yorubas are said to vary in color from jet black
to quite light, and in features, from the heavy, thick cast of
countenance to the more delicate and refined. There is among
them a tradition that their forefathers were of Oriental origin,
and a large number of American Negroes are said to be of
Yoruba stock. The nation comprises many tribes and they are
both city-dwelling and farming people. It is said that the
houses of the chiefs often contain as many as fifty rooms,
decorated with carvings representing symbolic devices, fabulous
animals, and hunting or warlike scenes. They have an
excellent system of government, the power being in the hands
of a Council of Elders, presided over by a chief. The chief
must always be taken from members of one or two families
and owes his position to a combination of the principles of
heredity and election. Yoruba is now divided into semi-independent
states, placed under British protection by the
treaty of 1893. The country extends from Benin on the east
to Dahomey on the west, and contains several large cities, some
with a population of 40,000.</p>
          <pb id="pendle29" n="29"/>
          <p>In 1821, Adjai, a boy of about eleven years, was captured in
Yorubaland and sold into slavery. The next year, he was rescued by a
British ship and landed at Sierra Leone. The missionaries cared for
and educated him and in December, 1825, he was baptised and given
the name, Samuel Adjai Crowther. He became a teacher at Furah Bay
and afterwards an energetic missionary in the Niger country. In 1842,
he went to England and entered the Missionary College, and in June,
1843, was ordained by Bishop Blomfield. Returning to Africa, he went
first to Yorubaland and afterwards to Abookuta where he labored
earnestly. At the latter place, he translated the Bible and the Prayer
Book into Yoruba and other dialects and also prepared school books
for the people. He showed the natives how to improve their way of
farming and how to trade their cotton for other things. He went on
several expeditions up the Niger and afterwards went to England,
where on St. Peter's Day, 1864, he was consecrated first Bishop of the
Niger. Bishop Crowther, upon reaching Africa again, established
several missions and turned many to Christianity. He died of paralysis
on December 31, 1891, having for many years displayed as a
missionary, untiring industry, great practical wisdom, and deep piety.</p>
          <p>Benin was another powerful native kingdom. It was first visited by
the English in 1553 and for many years carried on a trade in ivory,
palm oil, pepper, etc. The Beni are said to be a pure Negro tribe,
speaking a distinct language and having a well-organized
government. In the seventeenth century, it was known to Europeans
as Great Benin. The King of Benin was a puppet in the hands of the
priests, who were the real rulers. The people are skilled in weaving
cloth, ivory carving and working in brass, and much of the work of
the native artists is to be seen.</p>
          <p>In 1897 the English consul general sent to ask for an audience with
the king. The latter requested the English to remain away until after
the annual “customs,” but in spite of this request, the consul, with
eight others started for Benin and
<pb id="pendle30" n="30"/>
were massacred on the way, only two escaping. A large English force
was sent against Benin and after a long, hard fight the city was
conquered and partly burned. The king and chiefs were tried, the
king deported to Calabar and the chiefs executed. The whole country
is now governed by a Council of Chiefs, under supervision of a
British resident.</p>
          <p>The kingdom of Dahomey, like those of Benin and Ashanti was a
purely Negro and pagan state. King Gezo, its most famous ruler,
reigned forty years and under him the country was exceedingly
prosperous. He reorganized the women warriors, or Amazons, for
which Dahomey is famous. The strongest and best looking women
were drafted into the Amazon regiments and they were the pride of
<sic corr="Dahomey">Dahomy</sic>. Each of these regiments had its own peculiar uniform and
badges and the Amazons took the post of honor and danger in all
battles.</p>
          <p>“Sir R. F. Burton, who saw the army marching out of Kano on an
expedition in 1862, computed the whole force of female troops at
twenty-five hundred, of whom one-third were unarmed or only half
armed. Weapons were blunderbusses, flint muskets and bows and
arrows and the system of warfare was to surprise the enemy.” “The
Amazons were carefully trained and the king was in the habit of
holding “autumn maneuvers” for the benefit of foreigners. Many
Europeans have witnessed a mimic assault, and agree in ascribing a
marvelous power of endurance to the women. Lines of thorny acacia
were piled up one behind the other to represent defences, and at a
given signal the Amazons, barefooted and without any special
protection, charged and disappeared from sight. Presently, they
emerged within the lines, torn and bleeding but apparently insensible
to pain, and the parade closed with a march past, each warrior leading
a pretended captive.”</p>
          <p>The independent existence of Dahomey ended with the surrender
of Bohanzi, the last native king and the kingdom is now a French
colony.</p>
          <p>The Basutos of South Africa were able for a great while to
<pb id="pendle31" n="31"/>
maintain their independence against the English and the Boers
through the patriotism and intelligence of Mosesh, their great leader
and king. When he was forced to make a choice of allies, he had the
insight and intelligence to choose the English and in the protectorate
of Basutoland the natives are sturdy and prosperous. Moshesh died
in 1869, but his people still enjoy the fruits of his tact and skill. “As a
result of the great work of Moshesh, Basutoland is today almost
entirely self-governing, with nearly 300,000 inhabitants, with annual
exports of grain, cattle and wool amounting to $700,000 a year.” It is
exceedingly encouraging to feel that when “the time” comes, as
come it will, that the descendants of all these brave peoples shall
again have opportunity for self-government they will be able to add
to their natural capacity that which they have learned from contact
with modern civilization.</p>
          <p>The Barbary States, on whose soil Carthage once stood, play, in
these days, an unimportant part in the world and the several states
are under the government of different nations. The native ruler of
Egypt is called the Khedive, but at present the government is
practically in the hands of Great Britain. Travel in Eastern lands has
become so rapid and comfortable that a trip to Egypt is now taken by
many people as a sort of summer outing, and every year thousands
of tourists gaze in wonder and awe at the Pyramids, the Sphynx, the
Catacombs and the River Nile.</p>
          <p>The Kingdom of Abyssinia was, for many years wisely governed
by King Menelik, who called himself, among other <corr sic="things, the">things, “the</corr> King of
Kings and the Lion of the Tribe of Judah.” Because the King had
been in ill health for some time, Prince Lidj Jeassu was, in May, 1909,
at the age of thirteen, proclaimed heir to the Abyssinian throne, and
Ras Hessama was appointed to act as guardian of the little heir and to
govern in his stead. In May, 1911, Prince Lidj Jeassu was proclaimed
Emperor.</p>
          <p>The inhabitants are justly proud of their centuries-old history and
prefer to be known by their ancient name of Ethiopians.
<pb id="pendle32" n="32"/>
As a whole they are an extremely intelligent people, grave of
countenance, elaborately courteous and it is said that with training
and experience they will be fully “capable of meeting the competition
of the Western world.” Their dress is the toga such as was worn by
the Greeks and Romans. Menelik is described as “tall and straight,
with a face full of intelligence and the manners of a gentleman as well
as a king.” As a part of their literature, handed down for centuries, the
Abyssians prize extracts from the Old Testament, in the Gheze
language, the Sabbatical laws, commandments given to Moses by God
and a translation of Josephus.</p>
          <p>It is said that on the plains and lower lands the soil of Abyssinia is
very fertile and produces sometimes three crops per year; nearly
every grain that will grow anywhere, can be grown in Abyssinia. The
inhabitants also engage in raising sheep and goats and a certain
amount of commerce is carried on. “By methods as old as Moses,
gold to the average amount
of five hundred thousand dollars is annually produced.”</p>
          <p>Recently a commission was appointed by the President of the
United States to visit Abyssinia and to endeavor to establish
friendly relations between the two countries. The commissioners were
received with great pomp and assured of the interest and friendship
of Menelik. Modern Abyssinia is said to be one of the few remaining
lands of romance and adventure.</p>
          <p>You have already heard of the Congo Free or Independent State. It
was so called because in 1885, representatives from fourteen
countries, the United States included, met and agreed that in that part
of Africa, at least, trade should be free to all, the navigation of the
Congo river should be free and the natives should not be oppressed,
but encouraged to make the most of themselves. King Leopold of
Belgium was one of those who consented to this and he <sic corr="succeeded">succeded</sic> in
having himself appointed a kind of guardian to see that the
agreement was carried out; but he was a wicked, cruel king, sly and
crafty and by degrees he obtained absolute power over every soul in
the Congo. He claimed that the Congoland and everything in<sic corr="it"> its</sic> was his and
<pb id="pendle33" n="33"/>
that the natives were simply his tenants and, strange to say, the
thirteen other countries allowed him to do so.</p>
          <p>The Congo is a vast region and has been described as being as
large as the whole of Europe, omitting Spain and Russia. Leopold
placed over every village in the Congo, men as heartless and cruel as
himself, and if the natives of a village failed to bring out of the forest
as much ivory and rubber as the overseers thought they should,
these wicked men would send after them cannibal soldiers who
would burn the huts and kill and eat the natives. The terrible things
that were reported from the Congo, horrified the civilized world, and
more than once Leopold pretended to stop them, but recently
accounts of awful conditions have been published. It is said that in
seven years, driven by their cruel taskmasters, the natives gathered
fifty-five millions of dollars' worth of rubber for which they received
barely enough to keep them alive.</p>
          <p>Dr. W. H. Sheppard, himself a colored man and a citizen of the
United States, took up missionary work in Africa in 1893. In 1911 he
returned to America from the Congo region and tells many
interesting things of the tribes with which he came into contact.
Among them there was a tribe which he was the first civilized man to
visit. The king of this tribe had heard of foreigners and their cruelties
to the natives, and as he thought they were all alike, he issued an
edict that no foreigner should enter his kingdom. But Dr. Sheppard
had won the love of the tribes around Stanley Pool, and accompanied
by some of them, he finally made his way into the forbidden land. He
found the natives weaving their own cloth, making their own farming
and domestic implements, and living very contentedly. He also came
into contact with a tribe of cannibals, whose lives were, as a matter of
course, on a much lower plane. He preached to them the Gospel, and
after many years has the happiness to know that he and his helpers
have been the means of bringing many to Christianity and civilization.</p>
          <p>There are still in Central Africa, regions which are unknown to the
civilized world, but in some places of which until recently
<pb id="pendle34" n="34"/>
little has been heard, the natives have reached a high state of
development. As you know, the Arabs who believe in the
Mohammedan religion have for centuries been traveling
through Africa, and in many places have erected villages for
permanent homes and intermarried with the natives. This is
true of Nigeria where the natives show their contact with the
Arabs in many ways. The two most important tribes of this
region are the Fallani and the Hausas, both of which are highly
intelligent and progressive. Kano, the chief city of this locality, has 
been called the Chicago of West Africa and is a busy
city with markets <sic corr="crowded">crowdeded</sic> with buyers and merchants selling
vegetables, fruits, fowl, sheep, goats and many other things,
while its shops are filled with native and foreign products.
The people engage in tilling the soil, tending herds, weaving,
dyeing, and manufacturing pottery, native cloth, farming tools
and simple arms such as daggers, spears, etc.</p>
          <p>Uganda, where good King Mtesa reigned in Stanley's time, is now a
British protectorate; but there is still a native king. It is said that one
hundred thousand of the natives are Christians and twice as many of
them can read and write. Beside the king there is a court and a
parliament, nobles, ministers and a code of laws. The people are
industrious, cultured and peaceable. “The white man cannot live
here long at a time, for in his flesh every cut or scratch festers, small
wounds become running sores and malaria turns to the fatal
black-water fever.”</p>
          <p>South Africa is rich in gold and diamonds and for many years was
governed by people called Boers, who are of Dutch descent.
Recently the Boers and England went to war and England conquered
the country and added it to her other possessions. It was to this
country that Livingstone, the explorer, went, taught and preached to
the people and converted many to Christianity. But the Boers were
not kind to the natives and oppressed them in many ways.</p>
          <p>Spreading all over South Africa is a great tribe of natives called
Kaffirs and of these the Zulus are said to be the best type.
<pb id="pendle35" n="35"/>
They are noted for their hospitality and though partly nomadic, they
are lovers of home and children. Those Kaffirs who have not been
tainted by the vices of the Boers are described as the “most
intellectual of all savage races, with lofty, thoughtful foreheads.” In
complexion they are dark with a tinge of red, the skin is thin and fine
grained and the hair crisp and curly. They are very proud of their
appearance and if asked what complexion they prefer will say, “black
like mine, with a little red.” The blacker a person is the more beautiful
the Kaffirs consider him and though Albinos are sometimes found
among them they are pitied rather than admired. In recent years
several Negro missionaries have gone to South Africa as well as to
other sections and the natives are joining the churches, educating
their children and learning many of the arts of civilization.</p>
          <p>Of the West Coast of Africa a writer has recently said that
“to partition finally among the powers this strip of death and
disease, of unaccountable wealth, of unnamed horrors and cruelties,
has taken many hundreds of years, has brought to the black man
every misery that can be inflicted upon a human being and to
thousands of white men, death and degradation or great wealth.” It
was from this part of Africa that the majority of slaves were brought
to America.</p>
          <p>Sierra Leone was founded on the West Coast by English
philanthropists as a home for freedmen, and later American friends of
humanity established a colony adjoining Sierra Leone for the same
purpose, and this colony was finally called the Republic of Liberia.</p>
          <p>The native tribes which live in Sierra Leone and Liberia and in that
part of the adjoining country which reaches toward central Africa
and which is called the hinterland, are a very interesting people. The
most progressive of them are the Mandingoes (whose language
Mungo Park learned) and the Vai. Of these the men are, as a rule,
stalwart and handsome and many of the women are beautiful. Other
tribes are the Gora, the Sunu, and the Kru, to which belong the Grebe,
the De, the Basa
<pb id="pendle36" n="36"/>
and the Gibi. The Krumen are the workingmen of the West
Coast. They are heavily built and muscular and neither the
women nor the men are especially attractive in appearance; but
they are very industrious and much of coast traffic depends on
their labor.</p>
          <p>The natives of this section manufacture a kind of pottery
which is very artistic and not unlike that made by the Indians
in this country. They also weave a cloth which is called
“country cloth,” and rude musical instruments, swords,
wooden plates, drums and similar articles are made.</p>
          <p>Throughout Africa there exist secret societies known by
different names in different places. The societies for men and
women are separate and distinct and they are not allowed to
hold sessions at the same time. In the vicinity of Sierra
Leone the women's society is called the Bandu and the men's,
the Poro. When the older women of the tribe decide to hold
a meeting, a space is cleared in the forest or bush and thus the
session has been named the Bandu Bush. The chief officers
are called “dibbles,” “boogies,” or “devils,” and they dress
in a very fantastic manner. Over the head and face is worn
a hideous mask from which hangs a covering of palm fiber so
adjusted as to completely hide the figure and disguise the individual.
They pretend to be supernatural and only the highest
officials know who they really are.</p>
          <p>Into the Bush the girls from about twelve to sixteen are
taken to be initiated. The girls who do not go are looked upon
with contempt and are called “silly” and “idiots.” The
initiates remain in the Bush for months and the women teach
them many useful things; among others, to be obedient and
respectful to their elders and to be good wives and mothers.
After they have been sufficiently instructed, they are “medicine
washed” and a public feast takes place in their honor, something
like a debut party in civilized countries. When the boys
go into the Poro bush they are told the laws and legends of
their tribe and commanded to respect them, they are taught to
<pb id="pendle37" n="37"/>
hunt and fish and are also made to understand their duties and
responsibilities as future husbands and fathers.</p>
          <p>Of the natives of western Africa a missionary has said:
“Whatever other estimate we may form of the African, we
may not doubt his love for his mother. Her name, whether
she be dead or alive, is always on his lips and in his heart. She
is the first thing he thinks of when awakening from his slumbers
and the last thing he remembers when he closes his eyes
in sleep; to her he confides secrets which he would reveal to no
other human being on the face of the earth. He cares for no
one else in time of sickness, she alone must prepare his food,
administer his medicine, perform his ablutions and spread his
mat for him. He flies to her in the hour of his distress, for
he well knows if all the rest of the world turn against him, she
will be steadfast in her love, whether he be right or wrong.”
How wonderful must be the women who can inspire and keep
such deep and constant love and devotion in the hearts of their
children!</p>
          <p>All lovers of humanity earnestly desire the civilization and
redemption of the entire continent of Africa, and many plans
to that end have been suggested. Speaking of these, Didwho
Twe, a native African, and a man of great culture and discernment,
has said: “A new form of Christianity for the African
race will develop from the present commercialism. The initiative
of this great change will come from men of pure African
blood—Africans in appearance, Africans in body, Africans in
spirit, Africans in pride, Africans in thought.”</p>

        <div2 type="chapter">
          <pb id="pendle38" n="38"/>
          <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
          <head>SIERRA LEONE.</head>
          <p>THE first historical mention of Sierra Leone was by Hanno
of Carthage, who is said to have entered its harbor and
to have hurriedly left, because of “the fires in the forests,
the beating of drums and the strange cries that issued
other of the approach of possible enemies, are used in some<figure id="ill5" entity="pendl38"><p>NATIVE KING AND COUNCIL, HINTERLAND, SIERRA LEONE.</p></figure>
from the bushes.” These signs by which the tribes warn each
parts today and have often struck terror to modern travelers.</p>
          <p>The Portuguese claim to have traded with the natives
around Sierra Leone as early as the middle of the fifteenth
century and English trade began a century later. Trading
posts or “factories” were established by these nations on
ground leased from the natives, but at first they were used for
a fair exchange of the valuable products of the country. It
was not until the colonization of America began that the kidnapping
<pb id="pendle39" n="39"/>
of the natives themselves was thought of. For about
two hundred years the great nations of the world engaged in
one form or another of the slave trade, but toward the end of
the eighteenth century the horror of the traffic began to force
itself upon the attention of friends of humanity everywhere.</p>
          <p>In 1765, Jonathan Strong, a slave who had been brought to
England, fell sick and was deserted by his master. He managed
to recover and when his master found this out he planned
to have him kidnapped and sent back to the West Indies. But
the great Granville Sharpe took all interest in the case, interceded
for Strong and finally succeeded in sending him out.
of his master's reach. Seven years afterward, Sharpe took up
the case of James Somerset and plead for him before the High
Court at Westminster.</p>
          <p>The case aroused wide-spread interest and the judges finally
decided that Somerset could not be held, and that from that
time forward every slave who set foot on English soil was
free. There were a number of slaves in London at the time
and these either left their masters or were driven away. The
condition of these people, without money, food or shelter, became
very pitiable. And meanwhile American Negroes, who
had found shelter with the British army, and other Negroes
from the West Indies joined their brethren in London, which
added to the distress of the situation. Granville Sharpe,
William Wilberforce, Dr. Smeathman, Henry Thornton, Joseph
Hardcastle, Thomas Clarkson and other good men joined
together to assist these freedmen. After a long discussion, it
was thought best to send them to Africa where they might not
only become independent, but might help to Christianize the
natives and break up the slave trade.</p>
          <p>The English government was persuaded to purchase from
Naimbanna, King of Sierra Leone, about twenty square miles
of land and the first colony reached Africa on the 9th of May,
1787. Several of the colonists had died on the voyage,
and of the 480 persons who embarked only 64 were living in 1791.
But the English friends of the colony were not discouraged;
<pb id="pendle40" n="40"/>
they formed a company which was first called St. George's
Bay, and afterward, the Sierra Leone Company. A large
sum of money was subscribed and the company sent out more
colonists, among them a number of English soldiers who had
been granted land as a reward for services. Several hundred
Maroons living in Nova Scotia sent a delegate to England to
ask that they might be allowed to join the new colony and
their request was granted. Some hundreds of Maroons from
the West Indies also joined the colony, but the deadly climate
caused many to die of fever and destroyed the energy of the
survivors. The people became entirely discouraged, and “the
whole community smouldered down into chronic mutiny.” At
this crisis, Zachary Macauley, father of the famous English
historian, was sent as general manager of the colony. He
acted as governor, secretary, paymaster, envoy to the natives
and clergyman, and it is said that he was peculiarly adapted
to the work. Things were moving smoothly, under Mr. Macauley's
management, when, in 1794, eight French ships filled
with sansculottes came into the harbor. The lawless French
men entered the town and conducted themselves in such an
outrageous manner that the governor asked to be given an audience
with the commander of the vessel. Macauley says
“As I passed along the wharf the scene was curious enough.
The Frenchmen who had came ashore in filth and rags, were
now many of them dressed out with women's gowns and petticoats.
Others had quantities of cloth wrapped about their
bodies or perhaps six or seven suits of clothes upon them at a
time. The scene which presented itself on my getting on board
the flag-ship was still more singular. The quarter-deck was
crowded by a set of ragamuffins whose appearance beggared
every previous description, and among whom I sought in vain
for some one who looked like a gentleman.”</p>
          <p>About the middle of October the French left Freetown, having
remained about a month. “They never revisited the place;
indeed, they had left it in such a condition that it was not
worth their while to return. Ten houses had been carefully
<pb id="pendle41" n="41"/>
burned to the ground and the livestock killed. Except the
clothes on their backs and a little flour, the Europeans had
lost everything they had in the world. * * *” “In the office,
every desk and every shelf and every drawer, together
with the printing and copying presses, had been completely
demolished in the search for money. The floors were strewn
with types, and papers and leaves of books, and I had the mortification
to see a great part of my own labor and of the labor of others
for several years, totally destroyed. At the other end of the house
I found telescopes, hydrometers, barometers, thermometers
and other articles lying about in fragments. In the town
library the volumes were tossed about and defaced with
the utmost wantonness, and if they happened to bear the
least resemblance to Bibles they were torn in pieces and
trampled on. In the collection of natural curiosities,
plants, seeds, dried birds, insects and drawings were
scattered about in great confusion. The destruction of
livestock was immense. In my own yard alone, they killed
fourteen dozen fowls, and there were not less than twelve
hundred hogs shot in the town. It was unsafe to walk in the
streets of Freetown during the forty-eight hours that followed
its capture because the French crews were firing at the pigs
of the poor freedmen over whom they had gained such a
questionable victory.” But as has been said, the French
finally left Sierra Leone, and left a very disheartened set
of colonists behind them. However, Mr. Macauley rallied
them as best he could and when he left the colony in 1799,
because his health had been broken by the fever, things were
moving on fairly well; but the year 1800 found the Company
with very little money left and the colony in a very
discouraging condition.</p>
          <p>The natives, who had for years been able to obtain as much rum
and gunpowder as they wanted at the nearest baccaroon,
did not appreciate the colony and gave great annoyance.
King Naimbanna, however, recognized the superior progress
of the Europeans and believed it to be due to their religion,
but he was very much puzzled when he found that there was more
<pb id="pendle42" n="42"/>
than one European religion. After much thought he decided
that in order to secure the greatest benefit to his tribe it would
be a good plan to send one son to Turkey with orders to become
a Mohammedan; another to England to be a Protestant and a third
to Portugal to become a Roman Catholic. This he did, but he shortly
afterward died and, except that the son who went to England died
on the homeward voyage, the result of the King's experiment is not
recorded.</p>
          <p>In 1807, twenty years after the landing of the colonists, the
Company turned Sierra Leone over to the British government.
In the same year the slave trade was declared piracy and an
English squadron was stationed along the coast to put down
the trade and to recapture slaves. Many hundreds were added
to the population in this way.</p>
          <p>Sierra Leone has passed through many trials before reaching
its present state, and there are also a number of very interesting
things in the history of this colony. The very first person who
actually conducted Negro emigrants from America to Africa
was Capt. Paul Cuffee, a wealthy Negro of New Bedford, Mass.
Among the colored residents who have risen to prominence may
be mentioned Mr. John Carr, Queens Advocate in 1840 and Chief
Justice in 1841; Samuel Crowther, a native and the first African
admitted to the Church of England (1841) and first Bishop of Niger
(1864); Staff Surgeon W. Ferguson, of the Army Medical Department
(1813) and Acting Governor (1841.); Mr. Robert Dougan, Queens
Advocate (1832), Acting Governor (1858-59); Dr. James W.
Blyden, scholar, author and diplomat. Dr. Blyden, who died
February, 1912, was, on more than one occasion entrusted with
missions to the natives in the interior which required
great tact and skill and which were always successful.</p>
          <p>On his mission to the King or Alami of Timbo, in 1873,
Dr. Blyden was invited to accompany His Majesty to a town
fifty miles away where was gathered an army of fifteen or
twenty thousands Foulahs. “The town was crowded and preparations
for war were being made, but prayers were not neglected.
<pb id="pendle43" n="43"/>
Five times a day immense crowds gathered at the Mosque
and soldiers with a musket in one hand and their beads
in the other might be seen going through their devotions.”</p>
          <p>The chief official in Sierra Leone is a governor appointed
by the English Crown, a colonial secretary, and an executive
and a legislative council. Freetown, the greatest seaport on the
West Coast, is the seat of government; it has an excellent harbor,
fortified with several batteries of heavy guns.</p>
          <p>There is a government school for the sons of chiefs; there are
public, technical and church mission schools, besides Fourah
Bay College, established in 1845, and connected with the
University of Durham. There is at present a railway of about
three hundred miles and others planned.</p>
          <p>In size Sierra Leone is about equal to the State of Maine;
much of the land has been cleared, and is regularly tilled;
the natives come into the cities for employment between
the sowing and reaping of their crops; sanitary arrangements
and a better understanding of the fever have improved
health conditions; many of the citizens are skilled artisans,
several are merchants, and Sierra Leone is now a flourishing colony.</p>

          <head>LIBERIA.</head>
          <p>ONE of the first persons in America to publicly denounce
the slave trade and to act upon his convictions was the Rev.
Samuel Hopkins, of Newport, R. I. He had owned and sold
a slave, but afterward became convinced of the sinfulness of
his conduct and devoted himself to arousing the consciences<figure id="ill6" entity="pendl44"><p>LIBERIAN SOLDIERS AND CITIZENS.</p></figure>
of his neighbors. He formed a plan to educate freedmen and
send them as missionaries to their native land, and he appropriated
to that purpose the money received from the sale of his
slave; he borrowed money to free a slave whom he thought
especially intelligent and brought about the emancipation of
three others. In August, 1773, he published an address to the
public in which he outlined his plans and begged for assistance;
he mentioned two devout African members of the Congregational
Church in Newport, by name John Quamine and Bristol
Yamma, who were willing and anxious to carry as best they
<pb id="pendle45" n="45"/>
could, civilization and Christianity to their brethren in Africa.</p>
          <p>Quamine, who was the son of a wealthy native of Annamboe,
had been sent by his father to England to be educated, but
the person to whom he had been entrusted, had treacherously
sold him into slavery. Besides the two named, Salmur Nubia,
another young African, was desirous of furthering Dr. Hopkins'
plan. But little money was donated and when the Revolutionary
War broke out, it put an end to the project. Many
years after, two of Dr. Hopkins' proteges joined the Liberian
colony—one of them was Salmur Nubia, the other Deacon
Newport Gardner.</p>
          <p>In 1787, Dr. Thornton, of Washington, D. C., published “an
address to the free people of color in Rhode Island and Massachusetts,”
inviting them to accompany him to the west coast
of Africa, there to plant a colony, but the plan fell through for
lack of funds.</p>
          <p>“The first public meeting ever held in this country to consider
the subject of African Colonization was called
by Dr. Robert Finley, and was held in the Presbyterian Church in
Princeton, N. J. After maturing his plans, Dr. Finley went to
Washington in December, 1816, during the session of Congress
and succeeded in having many of the prominent men present in
the city attend a meeting to consider his project. Hon. Henry
Clay was present and was called to the chair. After the society
was organized many other prominent Americans became
actively interested in its work. Among them were Judge
Bushrod Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, John
Marshall, John Randolph, J. H. B. Latrobe, and Francis Scott
Key.</p>
          <p>About thirty-five years after the first colony of freedmen
went from England to Sierra Leone, the American Colonization
Society sent a company of freedmen from this country to
Africa. About the same time, Congress authorized the President
to provide a place in Africa for the slaves who might be
recaptured at sea. The government chartered a vessel to carry
its agents and agreed to take also the agent of the Colonization
<pb id="pendle46" n="46"/>
Society and such free Negroes as that organization should recommend.
Eighty-nine persons were finally selected and the vessel sailed from New
York February 6, 1821, arriving in Sierra Leone March 9.</p>
          <p>The government agents in charge were Rev. Samuel Bacon
and John P. Bankson, while Dr. Samuel Crozer was the agent
of the colonization society. The emigrants made a temporary settlement
at Sherbo, but before land could be purchased for a permanent home the
agents and many of the colonists died. Just before his death Dr.
Crozer solemnly entrusted the colony and all its <sic corr="possessions">posessions</sic>
to the care of the Rev. Daniel Coker, a colored Methodist preacher.
Though new to such responsibility, the latter managed affairs with
great ability and received the praise of Dr. Ayres, the next agent.</p>
          <p>After looking over the situation Dr. Ayres decided to buy land on Mesurado
Bay, and in December, 1821, made an agreement with the six native
kings or headmen who owned the ground, receiving a deed to the same
and giving in exchange muskets, beads, gunpowder, rum, knives, forks,
spoons, hats coats, looking-glasses, handkerchiefs, canes, umbrellas, soap, etc.
The contracting parties pledged themselves to live in peace forever.
The first colony arrived at Mesurado on January 7, 1882, and found much work
awaiting them; land was to be cleared, shelter made for the provisions,
houses built for themselves and many other things to be done which life
in a new country required.</p>
          <p>Though the natives had promised friendship it was not long before they
began to show signs of hostility. Slave traders in the neighborhood
aroused ill feeling by telling the tribes that if the colony was allowed to
flourish, it would break up the selling of slaves and would mean the loss
of the rum and tobacco which the natives had been taught to prize.
Several raids were made upon the colonists and they who were already
fighting disease and great bodily discomfort were called upon to take
arms and fight for life itself. The situation called forth the best that was
in them and among the freedmen who distinguished
<pb id="pendle47" n="47"/>
themselves in the early days, along more than one line were Lot
Cary and wife, Elijah Johnston, Collin Teague and wife, Joseph Blake,
Richard Sampson and Joseph Langford and wife. Later came Joseph Shepherd,
a school teacher, and J. B. Russwurm, who founded and edited the
Liberia Herald and afterward became Governor of New Maryland.
Colored lieutenant governors were Lot Cary, Rev. C. M. Waring, Anthony D.
Williams, J. J. Roberts. Other notable characters of colonial Liberia were
George M. Erskine, a Presbyterian minister; Jacob W. Prout,
of Baltimore; Mr. and Mrs. Tittler, missionaries; Archie Moore and
Closter Simpson, of Mississippi; Dr. Robert McDowell, of Edinburgh,
Scotland, colonial physician; and Charles H. Webb, his assistant.</p>
          <p>In 1836 Mr. James Brown was elected President of the Town Council
of Monrovia, an office equal to that of mayor. Mr. Brown took
the greatest interest in agriculture and made a number of very
interesting and successful experiments. He published several
circulars looking to the promotion of good farming in the colony
and he also instituted an agricultural conversation club,
a fair and a museum. He lent every assistance to the White Plains
Manual Labor School, established during his presidency by Missionary
Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. The school was located
at Millsburg, a beautiful and fertile spot, and was under the
care of Rev. B. R. Wilson.</p>
          <p>No one can read the early history of Liberia without deeply appreciating
the spirit of Christian love and devotion which moved the white
agents and missionaries most of whom gave their lives to the cause;
among them were Bacon, Andrus Sessions, Helton, Ashmun, Randall,
Levi Scott and others.</p>
          <p>The spirit which animated Bacon seems to have been in all the rest.
Said he, “As regards myself, I counted the cost of engaging in the
service before I left America. I came to these shores to <hi rend="italics">die</hi> and
anything better than death is better than I expect.”</p>
          <p>After the colony had been established, many slave owners
<pb id="pendle48" n="48"/>
in the United States freed their slaves and sent them to Liberia.
Hundreds were recaptured from slave vessels, and several companies
of free Negroes joined the colony. The colonization society had
branches in many states and was untiring in its effort to support the colony.
The Colonization Society of Maryland was independent of the
National Colonization Society because it was found that thereby it
would receive more support from the state legislature. The colony
at Cape Palmas was founded and controlled by the Maryland
Colonization Society, but finally became part of the Liberian Republic.</p>
          <p>The natives showed themselves willing to be taught. Writing of them
in 1827 Lot Cary said: “The heathen in our vicinity are very anxious
for the means of light. They will buy it, beg it, and sooner than miss it,
they will steal it. In renewing our school establishment up to Cape Mount,
I had upwards of forty natives carry out baggage, and though they had
every opportunity to commit depredations nothing was lost except
fifteen spelling books.”</p>
          <p>When it was plainly to be seen that Liberia as a colony could not defend
itself steps were taken to form it into an independent government,
and on July 26, 1847, the colony became the Free and Independent
Republic of Liberia. Article I, Section 1 of the constitution reads as
follows: All men are born equally free and independent, and have
certain natural inherent and inalienable rights, among which are the
rights of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring,
possessing and protecting property, and of pursuing and obtaining
safety and happiness.</p>
          <p>The republic was first recognized by Great Britain, next by France
and then by the other powers. The chief officials are the President,
Vice President, a Senate and House of Representatives, a Cabinet
and a Supreme Court. The President must be thirty-five years of age
and own real estate; electors must be of Negro blood and be owners of land;
natives may vote but usually do not except in larger towns.</p>
          <p>Governor Joseph Jenkins Roberts became the first President
<pb id="pendle49" n="49"/>
of the Liberian Republic and served from 1848 to 1856. Succeeding
Presidents were Hon. Stephen A. Benson, 1856-64; Daniel Warner,
1864-68; James S. Payne, 1848-70; Edward J. Roye, 1870-72; James Jenkins
Roberts, 1872-76; James Spriggs Payne, 1876-78; Anthony W. Gardner,
1878-84; Hiliary R. W. Johnson, 1884-1891; Joseph J. Cheeseman, 1892-98;
William D. Coleman, 1898-1900; Garretson W. Gibson, 1900-04; Arthur Barclay,
1904-12.</p>
          <p>On January 1, 1912, Hon. Daniel Edward Howard was inaugurated
President of the republic. “It was the first inauguration ever attended
by native chiefs.”</p>
          <p>Liberia is about the size of the State of New York, and the
total population is between fifteen and twenty-one hundred
thousand, about twelve thousand of whom are Americo-Liberians.
The principal tribes represented are the Mandingo,
the Kisi, the Gola, the Kru and allies. The coast region is
divided into three counties—Basa, Sino, and Maryland.</p>
          <p>There is a government college, Methodist college and a
Protestant Episcopal high school; Dr. Blyden was at one time
president of Liberia College. Dr. Alexander Crummell once had
charge of the Episcopal mission in that country.</p>
          <p>Francis Burns was the first colored missionary bishop
of the Methodist Episcopal Church to West Africa, serving
from 1858 to 1863. In 1834 he went to Liberia and did splendid
work as evangelist and teacher. Upon his election to the bishopric,
he came to this country to be ordained and returned to Africa.
In a few years his health failed and in 1863 he died. John Wright
Roberts was ordained a few years afterward and succeeded
Bishop Burns. “Roberts vigorously carried forward the work so
wisely begun by his predecessor, and it is said that at the time of
his death, in 1875, the Methodist Episcopal Church in Africa numbered
more than two hundred thousand souls.” “The Right Reverend S. D.
Ferguson, the present Protestant Episcopal Bishop of Liberia,
is a native of South Carolina. Bishop Ferguson has spent almost
his entire life in Africa. Although now advanced in age, he is
<pb id="pendle50" n="50"/>
extremely active and has a firm grip on his work. He has
trained up a fine body of native clergymen.”</p>
          <p>In Liberia there is an organized militia, a volunteer force
and a police force. Every male citizen from sixteen years old
to fifty, capable of bearing arms, is liable to serve. The
national flag bears a single star and stripes.</p>
          <p>The hinterland is undeveloped so that the resources of the
country are not exactly known, but gold, diamonds, copper,
lead, zinc have been found. There are no railways and oxcarts
are the vehicles commonly used; a motor road has recently
been constructed, about twenty miles in length. Seven lines
of steamers regularly visit Monrovia—British, German,
French, Spanish.</p>
          <p>The following colored Americans have served as United
States Ministers to Liberia: Hon. J. Milton Turner, John H.
Smith, Henry Highland Garnet, O. W. L. Smith, Ernest
Lyon, W. D. Crum. Hon. James Robert Spurgeon, a graduate
of Yale, was at one time secretary of legation. He was commended
for excellent service. In 1902, Hon. George W. Ellis,
of Kansas University, succeeded Mr. Spurgeon. Mr. Ellis
served eight and one half years, and as he is an authority upon
questions of economics and sociology, he was able to render
important service to the Liberian government.</p>
          <p>Of Liberia, Mr. Ellis says: “Liberia offers to the United
States an opening to the most extensive, the most desirable and
the best paying commerce of all the world. Agricultural possibilities
of the republic are tremendous, on account of the
fertility of the soil. Liberia also affords access to a hundred
million Sudanese natives, the highest type of the Negro race,
and cultured in many arts.” “The Sudanese of northern Africa
have a civilization dating back for centuries, and similar in its
origin to that which made Morocco the metropolis of Negro
culture years ago.”</p>
          <p>Besides the multitude of valuable articles to be found in
Liberia proper and the Hinterland, “not least are the hides of
many animals—of the leopard, the beautiful spotted bushcat,
<pb id="pendle51" n="51"/>
of many varieties of deer, of the monkey, the alligator and the
boa-constrictor. All these beasts inhabit the interior. The
elephant is to be found within two or three days' walk of Cape
Mount. Domestic cattle are also numerous on the Mandingan
plains and among some of the coast tribes. These cattle are
descended from ancient stock, introduced into Africa centuries
ago from Egypt and the Mediterranean.”</p>
          <p>The government of Liberia has not had a smooth path, for,
envious of the great natural wealth which the country contains,
some of the European powers have artfully tried to undermine
the republic. In 1910 a commission, appointed by President of
U. S., visited Liberia to look into the condition of the country,
as the Liberians had urgently requested America to come to
their aid. The commission consisted of Messrs. Roland P.
Folkner, George Sale and Emmett J. Scott: the latter has been
for many years, secretary to Dr. Booker T. Washington. The
commission reported favorably and the United States has
established a sort of financial protectorate over the country and
has placed American officials in charge of Liberian customs.</p>
          <p>Writing of Liberia in 1832 a visitor says: “All my expectations
in regard to the health, harmony, order, contentment,
industry and general prosperity of the settlers were more than
realized. I saw no intemperance nor did I hear a profane
word. I know of no place where the Sabbath appears to be
more respected than in Monrovia; no man, not even a native,
could be hired “for love or money” to work on the Sabbath
day. Most of the settlers appear to be rapidly acquiring property
and I have no doubt that they are doing better for <sic corr="themselves">themserves</sic>
and their children than they could do in any other part
of the world.”</p>
          <p>“Previous to the settlement of Liberia the mouths of the
rivers St. Paul, Mesurado and St. John were the greatest marts
for slaves on the windward coast. Thousands came down
those streams each year and were sold away. Now those
rivers are used by the husbandmen to bring their produce to
Monrovia, Grand Bassa and Etina, and the native paddles
<pb id="pendle52" n="52"/>
his canoe in safety under the protection of the colonies founded
by the Colonization Society.”</p>
          <p>A visitor to Liberia in 1910 writes: “The people of Monrovia
look, act and dress very like the better class of Negroes
of Atlanta or Louisville. All the Americo-Liberians (and
many civilized natives) are neatly but not flashily clothed, and
most of the aborigines put on an extra cloth when they come
to town. I doubt if there be anywhere in the United States a
Negro community of the size of Monrovia where there is so
little boisterousness or profanity. Swearing is a lost art and I
saw but one case of drunkenness during my first month in
Monrovia.”</p>
          <p>“The Liberian Sabbath suggests the quiet of a New England
city—a quiet that is broken only by the sound of church
organs and congregational singing. The churches are well
attended and the services are conducted with due regard to
dignity and reverence.” So you see that for at least eighty
years the Liberians have conducted themselves with the same
dignity and have had no need to be ashamed of their country.</p>
          <p>A writer describes the inaugural ceremonies of President
Howard, held January 1, 1912, as very imposing. “It was the
first inauguration ever attended by native chiefs, headmen and
retainers, and their presence was significant. They talked
nothing but peace and prosperity, and promised to do all in
their power to make the new administration a highly successful
one. Nearly two thousand natives from the interior listened to
President Howard advocate that they be given equal rights,
and when on the second day President Howard and Vice
President Harmon donned attire similar to that worn by the
native chiefs, the incident occasioned much good feeling.”</p>
          <p>Following is the official family of the new administration:
President, Daniel Edward Howard; Vice President, Samuel
George Harmon; Secretary of State, C. D. B. King; Secretary
of Treasury, Thomas W. Haynes; Secretary of War and Navy,
Wilmot E. Dennis; Postmaster General, Col. Isaac Moort;
Secretary of Interior, J. J. Morris; Attorney General, Samuel
<pb id="pendle53" n="53"/>
A. Ross; Secretary of Education, B. W. Payne; Executive
Secretary to the President, Walter F. Walker.</p>
          <p>Still another writer sums up a recent article on Liberia as
follows: The Republic needs men, not so much missionaries
in the ordinary sense of the word. Like the Negroes of the
United States, she appears to have no lack of preachers. She
needs men who will support themselves by their toil, and who,
as citizens, will strive for the national good. Especially does
she need men of mechanical ability to grapple with her industrial
tasks. I think if I were a Negro, Liberia would appeal
to me strongly upon this ground. I think I would count it a
privilege to cast in my lot with the Negro Republic, to toil with
her for high national ideals, for the assimilation and civilization
of my brothers of the jungle, and to prove to the world
what the black man can do.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
          <head>HAITI AND SANTO DOMINGO.</head>
          <p>HAITI lies in the Atlantic Ocean a short distance, about 600
miles, to the southeast of Florida. This little island
which Christopher Columbus named Hispanola or little
Spain and which was afterward called Santo Domingo, has<figure id="ill7" entity="pendl54"><p>THE PRESIDENT'S PALACE, PORT AU PRINCE, HAITI.</p></figure>
been the scene of many stirring events which we can here but
briefly mention. On this island Europeans built the first city
and erected the first Christian church in the New World; here
Negro slaves struck their first blow for freedom and here was
founded the first Negro Republic.</p>
          <p>In formation the country is diversified by mountains and
valleys, by majestic plains and swiftly flowing rivers; the
landscape is attractive and the climate delightful. When Columbus
and his fellow-voyagers came upon the island in December, 1492,
the beauty of the country and the kindness of
<pb id="pendle55" n="55"/>
the natives so impressed him that in reporting his discovery
to the King and Queen of Spain, he said: “These people love
their neighbors as themselves; their discourse is ever sweet
and gentle and accompanied with a smile. I swear to your
Majesties there is not a better nation or a better land.” You
will regret to learn that the example of these natives (who
though ignorant of the Christ, yet practiced his precepts) was
utterly lost upon the Spaniards, so-called followers of Jesus.
The Spaniards had not long been settled upon the island before
they had turned the friendly natives into bitter foes and
the bitterest foe of all was Caonbo.</p>
          <p>He had his stronghold in one of the mountain fastnesses and
after the Spaniards began to cruelly treat the natives Caonbo
and his followers would descend from the mountains and
wreak vengeance upon the whites. For a long time he was a
terror to the settlers, but he was finally captured by treachery
and placed on board a vessel bound for Spain, though he did
not live to reach there.</p>
          <p>It is said that when the Spaniards discovered the island, the
natives numbered about one million and in fifteen years,
through overwork and cruel treatment, only about one-twentieth
of them were living and by the year 1600 the last native
had died. The childish, trusting natives were taught from the
beginning that the Spaniards came from heaven and as the
cruelties increased and life became unbearable, they began to
ask their oppressors when they would return to heaven and to
beg them to hasten their departure.</p>
          <p>When it became evident that the natives would finally die
out entirely, the wicked plan was formed to capture natives of
Africa and bring them over the sea to do the work and suffer
the treatment which had killed so many thousands of the native
Indians of Hispanola; this, in the early sixteenth century
was the beginning of Negro slavery in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
          <p>The English and the French had long envied the Spanish
their West Indian possessions, and in 1630 French people established
<pb id="pendle56" n="56"/>
a colony at St. Christopher on the island of Santo Domingo,
but the Spanish drove them away. The French then took
refuge on the tiny island of Tortuga near by and lived quietly
there for awhile; but the Spanish went there one day while
the men were at sea and killed all the women and children.
The Frenchmen, their hearts filled with grief and rage, became
pirates; others joined them and for over fifty years war was
waged between them and the Spanish. In 1697, the French
obtained from Spain a regular cession of the western part of
the island of Santo Domingo and began to colonize it, naming
their part Haiti.</p>
          <p>After that, the two nations lived peacefully on the island;
the fertile soil was thoroughly cultivated and prosperity
reigned. Meanwhile, there had sprung up three distinct divisions
of the population: the whites, of European descent;
the blacks, of African descent, and the mulattoes, who were an
admixture of the other two races. From time to time the
blacks had risen in insurrection because of cruel treatment,
many had escaped to the mountains and had there made for
themselves homes; but the large majority were slaves. The
mulattoes, though free in name, were far from free in reality;
they were taken advantage of, imposed upon and the worst
indignities heaped upon them; they were allowed to hold no
public office, to take no part in public affairs and to practice
no profession, it mattered not how well qualified they might
have been. So they busied themselves with the buying of
land and other property and with the acquirement of education
and culture; they were compelled to serve a length of
time in the army and became skilled in the tactics of war.
Numbers of them grew very wealthy, traveled abroad, educated
their children in France and were persons of refined
and cultivated tastes.</p>
          <p>At the outbreak of the revolution in France, the population
of Haiti was about 500,000, of which about 40,000 were whites,
30,000 mulattoes and the remainder, a tremendous majority
as you see, were black slaves; the mulattoes at this time owned
<pb id="pendle57" n="57"/>
about one-third of the soil and one-fourth of the slaves. While
residing in France, the mulattoes had made friends among the
most advanced thinkers of that country and, putting before
these friends the state of affairs in Haiti, had received great
sympathy.</p>
          <p>The whites of Haiti largely sided with the revolutionary
party in France (though some were Royalists) and at once
responded to the call of the National Convention in Paris by
sending delegates and by adopting the motto: “Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity.” The mulattoes also demanded representation
which was denied them, so they sent a delegation of their
own, headed by J. Vincent Ogé, who had been educated in
France. This delegation was well received by Lafayette, Abbe
Gregoire, Robespierre and other influential Frenchmen, who
belonged to a society called the Friends of the Blacks, and
who were really trying to put into practice their noble motto;
said Robespierre, “Perish the colonies rather than sacrifice
one atom of our principles.”</p>
          <p>When Ogé and his fellow delegates returned to Haiti
they were arrested “for their presumption” and put to
death in a horrible manner. This news aroused great indignation
in Paris and the Friends of the of the Blacks brought such
influence to bear upon the National Assembly that a decree was
passed declaring that “all persons of color, born of free parents,
were entitled to all the privileges of French citizens.”</p>
          <p>During these happenings neither whites nor mulattoes
had given a thought to the slaves, but the pulse of Freedom
throbbing throughout the world and the blacks were thinking
for themselves. They had long been secretly planning a stroke
of some kind and on August 23rd, 1791, they arose and swept
from plantation to plantation, killing and burning as they
went. It is said that fully one thousand plantations were destroyed
and twelve hundred families reduced to want and
misery. As mulattoes and whites were both slave-holders,
this blow drew them together for the time against the blacks;
the Spanish of Santo Domingo attacked the Haitians, Royalists
<pb id="pendle58" n="58"/>
fought Revolutionists and the war which resulted was
“neither a civil war nor a foreign war, nor a war of races,
but a composite of all three.”</p>
          <p>At this moment appeared the mighty leader of the Blacks,
Pierre Dominique Toussaint Breda, who, because he could
always find a way or make one, was once called by a French
General, Toussaint the Opener, Toussaint L'Ouverture and
this is the name by which he is known to history. As a child
Toussaint possessed unusual intelligence and was taught to
read and write by a fellow slave. As he grew he was constantly
improving his mind; he gained quite a knowledge of Latin
and medicine and was often employed as a horse doctor.
He was finally promoted to be coachman by his master and
allowed the use of the library in his spare time. This advantage
he fully appreciated as you may judge.</p>
          <p>When the slave insurrection broke out on an adjoining plantation,
Toussaint refused to join the blacks because he thought
their plans cruel and useless. He secretly conveyed his
master and family to an American vessel which was about to
sail sending with them as much produce as he could gather.
Then, seeing the aimlessness of the insurrection and the need
of leaders, he joined the blacks and immediately was placed
in a responsible position. He disciplined and trained his men,
who were devoted to him, until they were worthy the name
“soldiers.”</p>
          <p>Meantime France and England had gone to war and in May, 1794,
an English squadron appeared before Port-Au-Prince; the French
gave up the city and the English took quiet possession. The blacks
and mulattoes had now joined forces and occupied the mountainous part
of the island under the command of Toussaint and Regaud, a mulatto.
In March, 1797, the French government appointed Toussaint
commander-in-chief of all the armies in Haiti. He began a campaign
against the English “who found him a powerful opponent, and dreaded
exceedingly to fall into his hands.” He also aided in conquering the
Spanish who occupied the eastern part of
<pb id="pendle59" n="59"/>
the island and they, by treaty, gave, over the whole island to France.
Toussaint next concluded a treaty with General Maitland, head of
the English forces, who “in behalf of his government acknowledged
Haiti to be an independent, neutral power and agreed to withdraw his
forces from the island.”</p>
          <p>In connection with the withdrawal of the English a story is told which
shows what manner of man Toussaint was. To make final arrangements,
General Maitland had agreed to visit General Toussaint at his headquarters,
and to do so he was obliged to cross territory filled with hostile Negro
soldiers. General Roume, a Frenchman, who had a command some
distance away, knowing that Maitland was practically defenceless,
sent word to General Toussaint to capture the Englishman. When the
latter arrived at headquarters he was compelled to wait quite a while
before Toussaint appeared, and, realizing his position began to grow
uneasy. When Toussaint finally made his appearance, he gave Maitland
two letters to read; the first was the treacherous advice of Ronnie
and the other his reply, which read as follows: “What! Have I not
passed my word to the English general? How then, can you suppose
that I will cover myself with dishonor by breaking it?
His reliance on my good faith leads him to put himself into my power;
and I should be forever infamous, if I were to act as you advise.
I am faithfully devoted to the Republic; but will not serve it at the
expense of my conscience and my honor.” It is needless to say that
General Maitland was ever after a firm friend of Toussaint L'Ouverture.</p>
          <p>When peace was restored, Toussaint who had been appointed governor for life,
showed himself as able to lead in the affairs of state as in affairs of war.
He caused the adoption of a constitution which acknowledged the
authority of France, but allowed no distinction between citizens because
of race or color; the whites were protected and their estates restored to
them and prosperity returned to Haiti. When Napoleon Bonapart made
himself First Consul of France, Toussaint, admiring his genius, sent him
a communication addressed
<pb id="pendle60" n="60"/>
“From the First of the Blacks to the First of the Whites.”
Napoleon, incapable of valuing such qualities of mind and heart as
Toussaint possessed, deeply resented what he considered the
presumption of the ex-slave; he could not bear the thought of Haiti,
independent and free, and resolved to establish slavery again.</p>
          <p>To this end he fitted out an expedition under command of his brother-in-law,
Le Clerc, which suddenly appeared off Cape Francois. Le Clerc seized Sanjos,
the harbormaster, and threatened to hang him if he refused to lead the
squadron into the harbor or to reward him with 2,000 pounds sterling
if he consented. Sanjos heroically refused to betray his country, but Le Clerc
succeeded in making a landing near by. General Henri Christophe,
commander of the forces in the vicinity, upon hearing of the arrival
of the French, burned the town to ashes and marched his men to Toussaint's
residence about forty miles away.</p>
          <p>Le Clerc had brought over with him Toussaint's sons who had been studying in
France. He sent them, under guard, to their father to beg him to yield quietly,
claiming (the boys really believed it) that Napoleon had only the good of Haiti
at heart. Toussaint's wife joined her prayers to those of her children and the
great general began to feel that they might be right. But soon his insight taught
him that the French meant nothing but evil and once more he took up arms.</p>
          <p>When Le Clerc found that he could not subdue the Haitians he made
a treaty of peace with them which he had no intention of keeping.
Shortly after this the home of Toussaint was surrounded at midnight
and he and his family were placed on a vessel and hurried to France.
It is said that the noble general did not lose hope, but felt that Napoleon
would give him justice. Being himself the soul of honor, capable of
justice to his humblest enemy, he judged the First Consul by himself,
but he was to find out his sad mistake. Upon arriving at France he was
separated from his family; he never saw Napoleon, but was taken from
one prison to another and finally
<pb id="pendle61" n="61"/>
unused to the climate and tortured by cold and hunger, on April 27th, 1803,
in the gloomy dungeon of Joux, great Toussaint died.</p>
          <p>The Haitians, furious at the treacherous and inhuman treatment of their
leader, took up arms under General Jean Jacques Dessalines. The French
army was reduced to a handful, as much by yellow fever as by war and was
compelled to capitulate. On January 1st, 1807, Haiti proclaimed her independence
and Dessalines was appointed governor for life, shortly after taking upon
himself the title of Emperor Jean Jacques I. Unfortunately, he had not experienced
and witnessed the inhumanities of the French and Spanish in vain, and after
a reign of about two years, marked by the greatest cruelties to the whites,
he was assassinated.</p>
          <p>The Spanish now took back the eastern part of the island and the western
was governed in the north by Henri Christophe and in the south by Petion;
Christophe took the title of King Henri I and had his family proclaimed
as royal, but Petion remained satisfied with the title of president. Upon the
death of these two, Haiti was united under the rule of Boyer. He succeeded
in bringing the Spanish part under his government, and the whole island became
one republic and was recognized by France in 1825. In 1842, the citizens
revolted against Boyer and compelled him to flee, and in 1844 those of the
Spanish section formed themselves into an independent republic, taking
their old name, Santo Domingo.</p>
          <p>The capitol of the Republic of Santo Domingo is the city of the same
name which was founded in 1496 by Bartolemeo Colombo,
brother of Christopher Columbus. It was destroyed by hurricane in 1547,
and rebuilt on right bank of the Ozama. The government is in the hands
of a president, a senate, and a chamber of deputies; there is a supreme
court and a regular army. The inhabitants are largely of mixed European
and African blood and there are many Turks and Syrians; the language
is Spanish and the religion Roman Catholic. The
<pb id="pendle62" n="62"/>
people engage in cattle raising, etc., and sugar growing is a
flourishing industry.</p>
          <p>The Republic of Haiti is governed by a president, a senate
and a chamber of commerce. The inhabitants number about
960,000, about nine-tenths of whom are rated Negroes, the
remainder mulattoes. There are four hundred national
schools, for which one million dollars are annually appropriated;
the religion is Roman Catholic, the language French;
the people chiefly engage in agricultural pursuits and excellent
coffee, cotton and cocoa are grown. There is a light railway
and a tramway of about five miles in Port-au-Prince, the capital.</p>
          <p>Besides the men already named, the following have ruled over
Haiti: Jean Pierre Boyer, from 1818 to 1843; Herard-Riviere,
four months; General Pierrot; General Soulouque, who called
himself “Faustin I, Emperor of Haiti,” and ruled from 1847 until 1859,
organized a terrible massacre of mulattoes. He was succeeded by
a mulatto, Fabre Geffrard, 1859-67; then came Sylvain Salnave,1867-9;
Nissage-Saget, 1869-74; Michel Domingue, 1874-6; General Boisrond-Canal,
1876-9; General Salomon, 1879-88; Gen. F. D. Legitime, 1888-9; General
Hyppolite, 1889-96; Gen. T. A. S. Sam, 1896-1902; Gen. Nord Alexis,
1902-08; Gen. H. E. A. Simon, 1908-1911.</p>
          <p>Hon. R. D. Bassett, of Pennsylvania, was the first United States Minister
to Haiti, and served from 1869 to 1877. He was succeeded by John
M. Langston. Other ministers were Frederick Douglass, John S. Durham,
W. F. Powell.</p>
          <p>The Rev. Theodore Holly, minister of the Protestant Episcopal
Church, made a visit to Haiti in 1855 to consult with the authorities
there as to the proposed settling in that country of American Negroes.
In 1861, a number of colored people left this country to make their homes
in Haiti, and some of their descendants are there at the present time. In 1874,
Mr. Holly was consecrated Bishop in Grace Church, New York, and was given
charge of the work in Haiti. Bishop Holly gained
<pb id="pendle63" n="63"/>
the affection of the people and did a notable work in the island. He died
March 22, 1911.</p>
          <p>The history of Haiti is not a peaceful one, for the Haitians are, as we have seen,
both by inheritance and training, a warlike people and there have been
many uprisings and revolutions. It has been said, however, that the mass
of the people have long since tired of war; and, indeed, how could it be
otherwise since they are always the ones who suffer most?</p>
          <p>There has been and is, however, a set of men who, instead of devoting their time
and talents to the arts of peace, are always ready to bring about an <sic corr="upheaval">upheavel</sic>
hoping thereby to gain for themselves wealth or position; there are also
men of other nations who, hoping for financial gain, are constantly,
though secretly, urging the Haitian malcontents to revolution.</p>
          <p>How sad that the example of great Toussaint should so often be forgotten;
Toussaint to whom Haiti was always first and self last; Toussaint,
true patriot, statesman and soldier of whom it has been said: “It is to
affirm the scantiest truth that to the names of Cincinnatus and Washington,
history has added that of Toussaint L'Ouverture.”</p>

          <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
          <head>BRAZIL, JAMAICA, AND BERMUDA.</head>
          <div3 type="chapter section">
            <p>THE early history of the Negro in Brazil and in all the West
Indies Islands was much the same as the early history of the
wicked system of slavery in Haiti. In each place we see the 
native Indians oppressed, crushed and killed in great numbers;
we then see native Africans brought over to take the<figure id="ill8" entity="pendl64"><p>A MAROON TOWN IN JAMAICA.</p></figure>
place of the Indians. Brazil was the headquarters of
slavery in South America, and the first African slaves were brought
to Brazil by the Dutch, in the early seventeenth century.
Though for many years the Dutch and the Portuguese contended for
power in Brazil, to the Negro it mattered not which side won for he
still remained in slavery. Both nations established colonies
in Africa whence they exported natives to the New World,
and it is said that for years the average exportation was not
less than forty thousand each year.</p>
            <pb id="pendle65" n="65"/>
            <p>In the latter part of the seventeenth century, about seventy years
after the arrival of the first slaves, a number of Negroes working
in the forests of Pernambuco, beat down their overseers, took
their freedom and for many years harried the Portuguese. In 1719
a plot was formed by Negroes in Minas Geraes, southeast Brazil, to
kill all the whites on Holy Thursday; but the plan was betrayed
before the time and most of those concerned in it fled to the forests
and lived with the Indians. These and other escaped slaves in Brazil
and the West Indies became known as Maroons.</p>
            <p>The origin of the word “Maroon” is uncertain, but it was a
name greatly dreaded by the whites of the countries above named,
for the Maroons were merciless and fearless. In the Dutch colony
of Surinam, a band of Maroons had been forming for some years
and by suddenly descending upon the settlers, from time to time,
had obtained arms and ammunition. The authorities of the colony
repeatedly tried to conquer or scatter them, but were always unsuccessful.</p>
            <p>In 1736, thinking to terrify the Maroons, the officials of Surinam
executed in a horrible manner a few who had been captured. “One
man was hanged alive by an iron hook stuck through his ribs, two others
were burned alive, six women were broken upon the wheel and two little
girls were beheaded.” But instead of terrifying the Maroons these awful
deeds made them furious. They waged such effective warfare that the
Dutch governor of Surinam finally offered a treaty of peace which
was accepted and signed by the great Maroon chief, Captain Adjoe,
in 1749. Peace lasted, however, but a short while, and after that, for many
years, there was war between the colonists and the Maroons.</p>
            <p>In 1773 troops were brought over from Holland but were unable
to subdue the Negroes, who added to their dauntless courage a perfect
knowledge of the country, and finally the colonists gave up the contest.
The Maroons formed an independent republic with laws and customs of their own.</p>
            <p>The great majority of the Negroes in Brazil, however, still
<pb id="pendle66" n="66"/>
remained in slavery, though few of them became reconciled
to that condition. Many committed suicide and the more courageous
joined the Maroons or went to live with the natives in the forests.</p>
            <p>Laws were passed in favor of the slaves and from the sixteenth century
they were allowed about eighty-five days in each year in which to
earn money with which to purchase their freedom; beside, “any
slave who was the parent of ten children could demand his or her freedom.”</p>
            <p>A number of the freedmen acquired great wealth, educated their children
and not a few became priests and bishops in the Roman Catholic Church.
In 1828 an English clergyman visiting Brazil wrote of the Negro as follows:</p>
            <p>“For the first time I saw an African Negro under four aspects of society;
and it appeared to me that in every one his character depended upon
the state in which he was placed, and the estimation in which he was held.
As a despised slave he was lower than other animals of burden that
surrounded him, more miserable in his look, more revolting in his nakedness,
more distorted in his person and apparently more deficient in intellect
than the horses and mules that passed him by. Advanced to the grade
of a soldier, he was clean and neat in his person, amenable to discipline,
expert at his exercises, and showed the port and bearing of a white man
similarly placed<corr sic="placed As">.</corr> As a citizen he was remarkable for the respectability
of his appearance, and the decorum of his manners in the rank
assigned him; and as a priest, standing in the house of God, appointed
to instruct society on their most important interests, and in a grade
in which moral and intellectual fitness is required, and a certain
degree of superiority is expected he seemed even more devout in his
orations and more correct in his manners than his white associates.
I came, therefore, to the irresistible conclusion in my mind that color
is an accident affecting the surface of a man and having no more to do
with his qualities than his clothes—that God had equally created an
African in the image of his person and equally given him an immortal
<pb id="pendle67" n="67"/>
soul; and that an European had no pretext but his own cupidity,
for impiously thrusting his fellow man from that rank in the creation
which the Almighty had assigned him, and degrading him below the
lot of the brute beasts that perish.”</p>
            <p>It has been nearly one hundred years since these words of wisdom were
written and slavery has long since been abolished in Brazil and elsewhere.
As you grow older, my children, you will understand that these words
are as true of the Negro today as ever they were and you will wonder
that all men everywhere cannot grasp this simple truth.</p>
            <p>At the present day the population of Brazil is largely an admixture
of Negro and Indian, the number of whites being comparatively small.
In the northern provinces the Indian element is largest, while in
Pernambuco, Bahai, Rio de Janeiro and Minas, Negroes are more numerous.
The Negroes of Bahia are said to be physically superb.</p>
            <p>Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1822, when it became independent
under the title of the Empire of Brazil, and Dom Pedro, son of the King
of Portugal, was crowned Emperor. In 1871, a law was passed for the
gradual abolition of slavery and in May, 1888, slavery was entirely abolished in Brazil.</p>
            <p>The peasant class, called Moradores, an admixture of Negroes,
Negroid and Indians, settle on the estates of the larger land owners and
are encouraged to do so by the owners since they give labor for rent.
They purchase goods and borrow money of the landlords and are usually
in their debt. The landlord and his wife are often godparents for the children
and share with them the two principal meals of the day. Speaking of this
class a writer says: Until the Negro in Brazil acquires money and invests it
in the buying and development of land so long will the white man hold
the political and social <sic corr="ascendancy">ascendency.</sic></p>
            <p>But there is no color line, and as the Negro has been given every
opportunity to advance, since the emancipation and many have
made splendid use of their opportunities, they have
<pb id="pendle68" n="68"/>
proven themselves good citizens in every sense of the word, and it is
said that more than one president of the republic has had Negro
blood in his veins.</p>
            <p>The wealthier <sic corr="Brazilian">Brazillian</sic> Negroes travel extensively, educate their
children abroad and buy much of their clothing in the shops
of London and Paris.</p>
          </div3>
          <div3 type="chapter section">
            <head>JAMAICA.</head>
            <p>The island of Jamaica, lying about sixty miles to the southwest
of Haiti, furnished another background for scenes of Negro daring
and bravery in their pursuit of freedom. The lives of the slaves were
exceedingly miserable, and in the early days many committed suicide,
believing that thus they would return to Africa. The first slaves were
brought over by the Spaniards about 1517, and almost from the beginning,
the Negroes began running away to the mountains and living with the
natives, as in Brazil. When the English gained possession of the island,
in 1657, these Maroons were so numerous and so well organized that the
new government was compelled to recognize them. To every man who
would promise obedience, twenty acres of land was given and a “Black Regiment”
was formed of the younger men under command of Juan de Bolas, in 1664.
He was the first Negro to receive the rank of colonel in the <sic corr="Jamaica">Jamacia</sic> militia.
But the Black Regiment was in existence but a short time before its
leader was killed and it was disbanded.</p>
            <p>From that time on, for over seventy years there was constant warfare
between the Maroons and the colonists. Jamaica abounded in fruits of
many kinds, there were many wild pigs, turtles and pigeons so
that the Maroons were well provided with food. They would frequently
descend upon the planters murder them and their families and burn their homes.
And this was kept up, as has been said for more than seventy years.
Toward the end of that period the government employed great packs
of savage dogs and imported a number of
<pb id="pendle69" n="69"/>
Indians from South America to harry and hunt down the Maroons.</p>
            <p>In 1738 a treaty of peace was signed by Governor Sir William Trelawney
and the Maroon chiefs, Cudjoe, Quaco, Accompong, and Cuffee. By the
terms of this treaty the Maroons were given their freedom and were to be
paid thirty shillings for each runaway slave returned to the colonists.
So much anxiety had the Maroons caused the planters that an English
statesman advised that they be “settled near some large town in the lowlands
where they would have easy access to alcohol, the use of which would
decrease their numbers and destroy the hardy constitutions gained in the
mountains.” What a temperance lesson should this suggestion teach us!</p>
            <p>From the signing of the treaty for nearly sixty years the Maroons
lived peaceably with the English, but in 1795 they revolted and nearly
succeeded in inducing the slaves to join them. The rebellion was put down
in a few months, and “those who gave themselves up before January 1, 1796,
were allowed to remain in Jamaica, and from them are descended the
Maroons of today settled at Moore Town, Trelawney Town and at various
places in their old haunts round the Cockpit country.” Nearly six
hundred of those who delayed to surrender were deported to Nova Scotia
and it was of them you have read in the story of Sierra Leone.</p>
            <p>Besides the Maroons there were in Jamaica many thousands of Negroes who
were held in slavery, and from time to time several uprisings occurred among
them. Writing of them in 1735 an Englishman says: “We who buy slaves say
we confer a good, removing them to a better state both temporal and spiritual,
the latter, few among us have the hypocrisy to own; to remove Negroes from
their homes and friends, where they are at ease, to a strange country,
people and language must be highly offending against the laws of natural
justice and humanity, especially when this change is to hard labor,
corporal punishment and for masters they wish dead. We are accessories by
trade to all that cruelty to their countrymen,
<pb id="pendle70" n="70"/>
which has subjected them to the condition of slaves little better
in our plantations than that of cattle. The rigour of their
usage having made some hundreds of them at Jamaica run
away into barren mountains where they choose to trust to
Providence rather than to their fellow Christians in the plantations.”</p>
            <p>But the wickedness and cruelty of slavery came to an end
in <sic corr="Jamaica">Jamaca</sic> in 1834 and the Negroes were allowed to fit themselves
to freedom as best they could. That this was not an easy
thing to do at first, you will readily understand. They suffered
injustice and discrimination and there was much unrest and
dissatisfaction.</p>
            <p>What has been called the Morant Bay Rebellion was the
outcome of years of oppression and injustice. The “Rebellion”
began on October 12, 1865 and lasted but two or three
days, the Negroes and the whites killing each other and burning
each other's homes. There were eighteen killed in all and
about thirty-one wounded. The whole island was in a state of
panic and martial law was <sic corr="proclaimed">proclaimd</sic>. Hundreds of innocent
Negroes were put to death and thousands made homeless. The
chief victim of the “Rebellion” was the Hon. George William
Gordon, a well-educated Negro of property and influence. He
had held several public offices, but was disliked by the governor.
The latter accused him of inciting the Negroes to riot, and
though time has proven him to have been innocent, he was
hung just eleven days after the beginning of the riot.</p>
            <p>“As early as 1850 the Negroes of Jamaica had made progress;
at the time of emancipation there were practically no
Negro land owners, but in sixteen years they were worth one
hundred thousand dollars. At that time there was no distinction
between white and colored; people were rated by culture
and wealth, though Negroes were on a much higher footing
than Jews, or ex-shopkeepers. The Negroes furnished two
regiments of soldiers and almost the entire police force of the
island was colored, The public printers, Messrs. Jordan and
<pb id="pendle71" n="71"/>
Osborn were colored, and likewise the editors of the Kingston
journal, the government paper.</p>
            <p>“The famous West India Regiments grew, in 1795, out of
a local militia corps called the St. Vincent Rangers. All the
twelve regiments took part with the navy in the capture of the
French, Dutch and Danish possessions in America. After the
Napoleonic wars were over, the West India Regiments (one or
more of which had been qualified as ‘Royal,’ so that their
direct descendant of today has royal emblems in its insignia),
were reduced and reorganized. After the abolition of slavery
in the 30's, they became more especially a body of Negro
troops, only the officers of which were white, and included
many Barbadians in their midst. Two Regiments (now two
battalions of the West India Regiment) were stationed at
Freetown, Sierra Leone, and from 1850 onwards they fought
many battles for the British government on the Gambia river
in the interior of Sierra Leone and in Ashanti. At the present
day the First Battalion is stationed in Jamaica and the Second
Battalion in Sierra Leone. The total strength of the two
battalions is about eleven hundred.”</p>
            <p>“Their present uniform, so picturesque, yet business-like,
and so attractive to recruits, was practically the invention of
Queen Victoria. It was introduced in 1858. These remarkable
Negro soldiers could, if necessary, play a considerable
part in maintaining the British position in tropical America,
if it were ever menaced.”</p>
            <p>At this time (1911) the Negroes of Jamaica are very progressive,
they have perfect political and social freedom, the
educational advantages are many and the standard high—the
Cambridge (England) examinations having been held annually
for forty years. Negroes, besides tilling the soil, fill nine-tenths
of the positions under the government, while many earn
a living as doctors, dentists, preachers, teachers, lawyers, musicians,
clerks, waiters, tradesmen, skilled artisans, postal employees,
press reporters and many other positions of honor and trust.</p>

            <head>BERMUDA.</head>
            <p>The Bermudas or Somers Islands consists of a number of
islands (said to number over three hundred) covering in all
about twelve thousand acres of land. The group is a British
possession, and in modern times its great value lies in the fact
that it is a naval station and coaling depot for English ships.
Bermuda was first discovered in 1522 by a Spaniard who
merely sighted and named them but did not land. Not long
after, Henry May, an Englishman, was shipwrecked on one
of the largest of the group. The story goes that he built, with
the aid of materials gathered from the wreck of his own ship,
a vessel of the cedar wood with which the island abounds, and
returned to England. He published an account of his adventures
and of the island, then entirely uninhabited.</p>
            <p>In 1609, Sir George Somers and others were also shipwrecked
upon the islands, while on their way to Virginia. It
is said that they, too, built a vessel and finally reached their
destination. There are no springs of fresh water in the island.</p>
            <p>It is said that Negro slaves were probably landed here in
1620 and that in ten years there were several hundreds of
them in Bermuda. Beginning with the latter part of the seventeenth
century and running through a period of more than
one hundred years, the colored people joined their masters in
seafaring and became a “fine, bold race of seamen.” “They
built sailing ships of from two to three hundred tons from the
timber of the Bermuda “cedar” (a red juniper), and in these
vessels brought the fish from the Newfoundland Banks to the
coasts of Portugal and the Mediterranean, or waited at the
islands of Madiera, Ascension or St. Helena for the returning
Indiamen, from whom they obtained cargoes of tea, spices,
porcelain, silks and other wares of the Far East. They carried
back port wine to Newfoundland, and Madeira wine to New
England and the Carolinas; and distributed all along the eastern
seaboard of North America the products of the East
Indian trade.”</p>
            <pb id="pendle73" n="73"/>
            <p>The House of Assembly, for which Negroes and Mulattoes
may now elect members and in which, if elected, they
themselves may sit, dates almost from 1620. Certainly from
1684, in which year the Bermudas became a colony directly
governed by the Crown. There is a garrison of five or six
thousand soldiers and seamen and besides these, there are
about 1,320 electors out of a population of nineteen thousand;
and there are no discriminations whatever on account of race
or color.</p>
            <p>The climate of the Bermuda is most delightful and it is
becoming quite a winter resort for persons from the United
States. It is said that there is hardly a more beautiful sight in
the floral kingdom than a field of Bermuda lilies in bloom.</p>

          <head>SLAVERY.</head>
          <p>HAVE you ever owned a kitten or any other living creature?
Was it your very, very own, to treat just as you
pleased? If you are a sweet-tempered child you have<figure id="ill9" entity="pendl74"><p>ANCIENT SLAVERY.</p></figure>
always been kind to Kittie, you have always seen to it that she has
been well fed and comfortable; no doubt you have often kept her in
when she would have liked to be free to come and go, and you may
have given her meat to eat when she wanted fish or milk. But because
Kittie was not a human being she <hi rend="italics">may have</hi> (we cannot tell) considered
you a good owner and made herself satisfied.
<pb id="pendle75" n="75"/>
If you are a cruel child with a bad temper, Kittie has had a
hard time; you have kicked, pinched, beaten, maybe half
starved her, perhaps even killed her; you have not cared
whether she was comfortable or not so long as you had her
to play with.</p>
          <p>If you have ever owned any living thing you can form some
idea of what it meant to be a slave owner and if you will
quietly think for a while you can faintly imagine what it meant
to be a slave; to talk, walk, dress, eat, move, live, not as one
wanted or knew to be best, but in obedience to the will of one's
owner. I have compared the state of a slave with that of your
kitten because nearly every child has owned a kitten, but the
comparison is a feeble one and as you come to understand
more about slavery, I want you to think out for yourself a
more just comparison. Of course, a kitten cannot talk, or
think, or plan, or hope, in other words, it is not, as you know,
a human being, but it is weak and<sic corr="defenseless"> defenceless</sic>, and you have
had absolute power over it, even the power of life and death.</p>
          <p>In our talks we have often mentioned slavery and it has always
been the Negro or the Indian who was the slave. I want you
to know how old and how evil a system slavery was, how in
ancient times it covered the then known world, and how none of
the races of  the earth have escaped its effects. Slavery existed in
one form or another since history began. Those who had the
strength and the power have ever been willing to compel the weaker
to do their bidding and not until the coming of Christ was there any
persistent attempt either to destroy slavery or to soften the hard lot
of the slave, but strange to say, it took hundreds of years before the
preaching of Christ's Golden Rule and Gospel of Love was so understood
by Christians every where as to cause them to work with energy
and determination for the freeing of all slaves.</p>
          <p>The ancient Hebrews, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Chinese,
the people of Indian, all held their conquered enemies as slaves. The
Phoenicians were great slave traders and kidnapped people of any and
every nation, selling them as slaves.
<pb id="pendle76" n="76"/>
“They stole Greeks and sold them, twelve centuries before
Christ, and they also sold stolen people to the Greeks.” It is said that
in every country the condition of female slaves was much worse
than that of the males and that they were required to do the hardest
work and were treated in the harshest manner.</p>
          <p>The Greeks held many slaves and the bondsmen of Athens
are said to have been much better treated than those of Sparta.
Since the Spartans were so stern with their children, they would
hardly have been tender with slaves. The slaves of Sparta were called
helots; they belonged to the state and were assigned to land owners,
so many to a certain amount of land. Their condition was very miserable
and as they increased in numbers they grew very restless, finally uniting
and marching against Sparta, which they nearly succeeded in taking.
As a usual thing, however, they were as loyal as they possibly could be
and often fought in the armies of Sparta, but they received little gratitude
from the state. The masters, through guilty consciences perhaps, were kept
in constant fear of uprisings, and at times would secretly give young Spartan
men permission to massacre the helots by night. At one time two thousand
helots who had valiantly fought for Sparta were slain.</p>
          <p>The Romans owned many more slaves than the Greeks and their numerous
victories over other nations filled the slave market to over-flowing.
It is said that at the close of the war with Greece and the East “men
were sold for four drachmae each or about sixty-two cents of our money,”
and these were men of the highest type of ancient civilization. The Romans
seemed to prefer to humble the proudest, and men, who in their own
country had been slave owners, men who were cultured and who had
lived in luxury, were most desired as slaves by the Romans. “All races furnished
their share of the greatest population of slaves that ever existed under
one dominion.” The Roman conquests extended through Germany
and France and as far north as England, and many Englishmen
<pb id="pendle77" n="77"/>
men were carried into slavery, and their chiefs chained to the chariot
wheels of the conquerors.</p>
          <p>“Roman citizens who had committed certain crimes became ‘slaves of
punishment;’ thieves who could not repay four times the value of what they
had stolen, became slaves to those whom they had robbed; children were
sold into slavery by their parents, and poor debtors were sold as slaves.”</p>
          <p>Many citizens owned a great number of slaves, some as
many as twenty thousand each. “The price of slaves were not
fixed; good actors, doctors, cooks, beautiful women, handsome
boys and jesters brought heavy sums. Learned men, grammarians,
architects, rhetoricians, and gladiators also sold at high prices; some
classes of artisans and laborers sold for upward of three hundred dollars
of our money each, but one hundred dollars was a fair average price for
a common slave, and when a slave could be bought for about half that
sum, the price was held to be low.” Rome as well as Greece experienced
many slave insurrections and these were usually led by the gladiators or
trained fighters; the insurrection of which Spartacus, the renowned gladiator
was the leader, cost many lives and would probably have been
successful had not the leader been slain early in the conflict.</p>
          <p>You can see that a country in which so many of the inhabitants were
restless, discontented and miserable and where so many others were
cruel tyrants, could not survive. Slavery is said to have been one of the
chief causes of the fall of Rome. After the decline of the Roman power,
the peoples who overthrew the empire, established there the feudal
system and serfdom, another form of slavery.</p>
          <p>The word serf means a servant or slave, and serfdom existed in nearly
every country in Europe. By this system the whole mass of poor people
were just a little better off than slaves; they were compelled to work the land
for the lords or owners and though they could not be removed from the land
and were only bought or sold with it, their condition was pitiable
<pb id="pendle78" n="78"/>
in the extreme; they were housed and fed with less care
than the livestock and clothed themselves as best they could.</p>
          <p>When the Christian nations of western Europe united to
take back the Holy City of Jerusalem from the Turks, every
serf who enlisted in these wars (which were called Crusades)
became free to live where and how he pleased upon his return
home, and from this time serfdom gradually died out in
most European countries; Hungary in 1848 and Russia in
1861, being the last to give it up. As the general emancipation
of Negro slaves in the United States took place in 1865, Russia
was but a few years ahead of this country in freeing its bondsmen.</p>
          <p>During the long wars between the Turks and the peoples of
southern and eastern Europe, in the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries, after each encounter, the defeated army was sold
into slavery; each also invaded the others territory and captured
women and children for slaves. It was about this time
that Negro slavery came into prominence, but white slavery
still continued in Turkey and the Barbary states, being carried
on by the corsairs or pirates until 1816, when an English fleet
under Lord Exmouth successfully bombarded Algiers.</p>
          <p>You have seen how, at some time in their history, members
of every great European race have been held in slavery. In
the early days of this republic white Americans had, in their
own persons a bitter taste of slavery in a most <sic corr="humiliating">humilitating</sic>
form; before this country possessed a navy, many American
merchant vessels were captured while passing through the
Mediterranean, by the Corsairs, of North Africa and the officers
and seamen of these vessels were sold as slaves. In
order to ransom those American citizens the United States
Government was compelled to pay the sum of one million dollars.
It seemed to give the Dey or ruler of Algiers the greatest
pleasure to insult and humiliate Americans.</p>
          <p>Speaking of the enslavement of the Negro in ancient times
a writer says: “The fact that the ancients regarded black
slaves as luxuries proves that their number could not have
<pb id="pendle79" n="79"/>
been large in European countries to which they were taken,
either by the way of Egypt or that of Carthage. Such details
as we have concerning the black slaves of antiquity all serve
to show that they were not numerous, far less so, indeed, than
were slaves belonging to some of the highest of the white
races.”</p>
          <p>It is said that with Admiral Don Christopher Columbus,
when he made his first voyage of discovery in 1492, was “Pietro
Alonzo, or Alonzo the Negro, who piloted the Nina, one of
the three vessels under the command of Columbus.” “Diego
el Negro was another Spanish Negro who sailed with Columbus
on his second voyage in the capacity of cabin boy. The
Negro pilot, Pietro Alonzo also made minor discoveries and
was the first European Negro navigator to discover the Pearl
Coast, after having purchased pearls from naked men. Alonzo
the Negro was also a pilot on Columbus' second voyage and
navigated the flagship on which Columbus himself sailed.
After leaving the Cape Verde Islands, Columbus relied upon
this black man's knowledge of navigation.”</p>
          <p>“Alonzo afterward became master and captain of a fleet that
sailed from Cadiz in, January, 1496, and upon his return to
Spain from America, this black navigator was given a public
dinner at Seville by the Duke of Medina, which was attended
by the city authorities and court officials, in recognition of his
achievement in opening up to Spain a veritable ‘gate of pearls;’
so that Negro brains aided in the discovery of America on the
very first voyage which Christopher Columbus made to this
continent.”</p>
          <p>It is also said that three hundred Negro porters and soldiers
accompanied Cortes on his Mexican expedition; Negroes carried
the loads of Balboa on his discovery of the Pacific Ocean
in 1513, and went with Hernandez to Peru in 1530. Negroes
assisted as servants and laborers in the founding of the Spanish
city of St. Augustine, in Florida, in 1565, and were sailors
in the Spanish ships which explored the coasts of Virginia in
<pb id="pendle80" n="80"/>
1521. A Spanish Negro explorer, Estevan, discovered New
Mexico, the land of the Zuni Indians, in 1539.</p>
          <p>In 1562, John Hawkins, an English sea captain, together
with a number of other Englishmen, asked permission of
Queen Elizabeth to capture native Africans and sell them in
the New World. The request was granted, but the ships were
so packed that a great many died on the voyage. When the
Queen heard of it she was shocked, and called Hawkins before
her to reprimand him and to take away his charter; but Sir
John grew very eloquent over the benefits of slavery to the
Negro and made the Queen believe that to bring the African
into contact with such highly civilized and Christian people
as their new owners, was to do God's service. So, instead of
scolding, the Queen praised him, took shares in his company
and in 1564, lent him one of her ships. John Hawkins was at
heart, you see, a knave instead of a knight.</p>
          <p>In the Mohammedan countries there have been black slaves
from the time of the prophet, and they often rise very high, as
well in the state as in the household. But in all these cases, the
Negro has but shared the common lot and might have been
sold on the same day with the Greek and Arab and by the same
trader. The Negro was then sold, not because he was a Negro,
but because be was a man whose services could be turned to
profitable account.</p>
          <p>While, as we have seen, Negro slavery was known in antiquity,
it was left to the New World in general, and to the
country which we call our own, the United States of America,
in particular, to bring it to its largest and worst development.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
          <head>THE NEGRO IN THE COLONIES.</head>
          <p>PICTURE to yourselves, dear children, a small group of
foreigners frightened and sad, with hearts aching for
home and for the loved ones from whom they had been
torn, with minds filled with dread as to what was about to
befall them; picture them landed, half clad and in chains in a
country where the climate, the people, the manners and customs
were all totally different to anything they had ever known
and you will have a faint idea of the feelings and the condition
of the first group of Negroes who landed on the continent of
North America.</p>
          <p>Although authorities differ as to the exact date of the landing
and also as to the exact number of persons which made up
this little group, we know that about the year 1619, a small
number of native Africans were landed in the Colony of
Virginia and that these were the forerunners of countless
others who were to be brought here to take a part as slaves
and freemen in the development of this country.</p>
          <p>The early part of the seventeenth century belongs to the
dark ages of the world's history, to the time when men had
not yet understood that it is the right of every human creature
to be free and that it is the solemn duty of every man and
every race to help toward true freedom every other man and
every other race. So that, at this period in North America,
we find the Negro and the Indian enslaved and white men and
women convicted of crime in Europe sent to the colonies as
bond servants. The latter were on much the same level as the
slaves, the great difference being that slaves were bound for
life, while bond servants were held for a limited number of
years.</p>
          <p>The story of the Negro during the first one hundred and
fifty years of his stay in America has been but briefly recorded
and the record shows little that is bright and pleasant. When
<pb id="pendle82" n="82"/>
the first slaves were landed the colony of Virginia included
what shortly afterward became Maryland and the history of
the Negro in the two colonies is much the same. The raising
of tobacco had not yet become an important industry, there was
no particular work for the Negro to do and for about fifty
years the increase in the number of slaves was but slight.
Until 1662 they were held because they were powerless to help
themselves, and because the whites found the holding of
slaves an easy and profitable thing, but no laws had been passed
concerning slavery in the Colony of Virginia. The law passed
in 1662 concerned the children and provided that the children
of slave mothers should be slaves, but eight years later the
following act was passed: “It is resolved and enacted that all
servants not being Christians, imported into this country by
shipping shall be slaves for their lives; but those who come
by land shall serve, if boys or girls, until thirty years of age,
if men or women twelve years and no longer.” Those coming
by water were Negroes and those by land were Indians. On
this point one writer says: “No doubt the Indian was as
thoroughly despised as the Negro; but the Indian was on his
native soil and therefore was a more dangerous subject.”
From this time on several acts were passed concerning slavery,
but most of them were designed to make the lot of the slave
harder and more hopeless.</p>
          <p>In the colony of New Netherlands, which as you know, was governed
by the Dutch, Negro slaves were much prized. Here, as in the other colonies,
a large amount of labor was necessary to make the country habitable,
and it was the Negro who did this heavy work, and without whom this
whole U. S. would doubtless have been at least one hundred and fifty years
behind its present state of development.</p>
          <p>The Dutch brought their slaves from the coast of Guinea and from their possessions in Brazil, and employed them as farmers, as roadmakers and as house servants. “The jolly Dutch fed and clothed their slaves as well as their
white servants. There were no severe rules to strip the Negroes of social
<pb id="pendle83" n="83"/>
amusements or public feasts. They were married and given in marriage,
and if there were no schools for them there were no laws against their
acquirement of knowledge.” Many bought or were given their freedom.
This is said to be very different to the treatment of the natives of South
Africa by the Dutch of modern times.</p>
          <p>When, in 1664, the English took possession of New Netherlands (naming it New
York), the condition of the slaves was not changed for the better. Severe
laws were passed putting the slaves on a plane very much worse than that
which they had occupied under Dutch rule. The English pretended to be
anxious to convert the slaves to Christianity, but they hastened to assure
the owners that no slave could become free by professing a belief in Christianity.</p>
          <p>“In 1709 a slave market was erected at the foot of Wall street and here Negroes
and Indians, men, women and children, all as sheep in the shambles, were
daily declared the property of the highest cash bidder.” “By law free Negroes
were prevented from holding property and there was therefore, but little
hope for the Negro in either state—bondage or freedom. There was little
in this world to allure him, to encourage him, to help him. The institution
under which he suffered was one huge sepulchre and he was buried alive.”</p>
          <p>The most stirring event in the history of slavery in the colony of New York was
the so-called Negro plot, of 1741. Some time before this the Negroes
had risen, burned a house and killed some of the whites; but the
troops had been called and the riot quelled. A feeling of insecurity, however,
took possession of the colonists and when in May, 1741, the charge
was made that a number of Negroes and a few whites had plotted to
kill the residents of New York city and burn down their homes, the
people became insane with fear and unable to reason.</p>
          <p>Innocent men and women were accused and cast into prison; false witnesses
arose on every hand; the accused, hoping to clear themselves,
made charges against others and every one
<pb id="pendle84" n="84"/>
was at the mercy of any enemy he might have. “From the 11th
of May to the 29th of August, one hundred and fifty-four
Negroes were cast into prison, fourteen of whom were burnt,
eighteen hanged, seventy-eight transported and the
remainder pardoned. During the same space of time
twenty-four whites were committed to prison, four
of whom were executed and the remainder discharged.”
This period has been likened to the time when so many
innocent persons were burnt as witches, at Salem, Mass.</p>
          <p>In the colony of Massachusetts the Pequod Indians were
the first slaves, but as they “would not endure the yoke,”
they were sent to the Bermudas and exchanged for Negroes
in the hope that the latter would bear slavery more
patiently. “The first exchange of Indians for Negroes
was made in 1637, the first year of the Pequod war and was
doubtless kept up for many years.” As in Virginia, slavery
here was at first of slow growth, but towards the end
of the seventeenth century the institution grew rapidly.
Slavery bred in this colony, as elsewhere a disregard
for human feelings in dealing with the Negro and
“Negro children were considered <sic corr="encumbrances">incumbrances</sic>, and
when weaned were often given away like puppies.” But
while these and many other hardships were imposed upon
the slaves the general tenor of public feeling was more
humane than in colonies farther south. So that when
a ship from Boston raided a native town on the
Guinea coast and brought home the captives as slaves,
the people protested and the kidnapped Africans
were ordered to be returned to their own country.</p>
          <p>The question of slavery, pro and con, was always being
discussed in this colony and in May, 1766, the
representatives of the people were instructed to vote
for the total abolition of slavery; but the measure was
not passed.</p>
          <p>In an address on slavery published in 1769 the author says:
“What! cries our good people here, Negro slaves in <sic corr="Boston">Bostion</sic>?
It cannot be. It is nevertheless true. For though
the Bostonians have grounded their rebellion on the ‘immutable
<pb id="pendle85" n="85"/>
laws of nature’ yet, notwithstanding their resolves
about freedom in their town meetings, they actually
have in town two thousand negro slaves.”</p>
          <p>The slaves, however, understood what was going on around
them, the undying longing for freedom within their
own breasts was increased and strengthened by the
conversations which they overheard and by the speeches
which some heard and repeated to others; there were
also a few slaves who had managed to obtain some
little education, of which they made the very most.
Being thus moved by the spirit of liberty it was
but natural that they became restless and sullen in
their bonds and their manner caused fear among the
whites, some of whom began to charge every fire or
other untoward happening to the Negroes.</p>
          <p>But white friends came forward to plead the cause of
the Negro slave and many efforts were made to enact
laws in his behalf. Encouraged, doubtless by the
friendly attitude of the best whites, many slaves
sued their owners for their liberty, charging that
they were unlawfully held in bondage, and in several
instances their petition was granted by the courts of
Massachusetts. On June 25, 1773, a petition, signed
by Felix Holbrook and other Negroes, was read before
the House of Representatives, “praying that they
may be liberated from a state of bondage and made
freemen of this community; and that this court would
give and grant to them some part of the unimproved
lands belonging to the province, for a settlement;
or relieve them in such other way as shall seem good
and wise upon the whole.” This petition, which had
been laid aside was read again before the house in
January, 1774. The committee which was appointed
to consider it presented, instead, “a bill to prevent
the importation of Negroes and others as slaves into
this province.” This bill with additions was read
in the House of Representatives, read in the Council
and sent to Governor Hutchinson, who refused to
sign it. It was then read before the general court,
sent again to the Council but finally failed to become a law.</p>
          <pb id="pendle86" n="86"/>
          <p>In the colony of Rhode Island there was, almost from the
beginning a feeling against slavery and laws were passed
against it, but neither the sentiment nor the law was strong
enough to prevent the holding of slaves in this colony. But
here the Negro had many white friends especially among those
known as Quakers; these friends did all they could to lighten
the lives of the oppressed, but their kindness angered the slave
owners. Laws were passed to fine those who entertained
slaves and to whip them if they could not pay the fine. As in
nearly every other slave-holding colony laws were passed
forbidding Indians as well as free Negroes to assemble
at night or to walk the streets after nine o'clock without
a pass or a lawful excuse.</p>
          <p>The many vessels which entered the ports of New England
and of Rhode Island especially, opened up a path to
liberty which the slaves were not slow to take;
they were constantly running away and shipping
on these vessels. The officers encouraged this, for they
made splendid seamen, but the loss to the owners
was so great that a law was passed forbidding the
masters of vessels to ship them. Vermont and New
Hampshire had always the smallest number of slaves.</p>
          <p>The Quakers, or Friends, did much to help the slaves
in Pennsylvania. “The first recorded protest of an
American against slavery was written in 1688 by a Quaker,
Francis Daniel Pastorius, adopted by the Germantown
Friends and by them sent up to the monthly meeting at
Philadelphia. Speaking of the slaves, Pastoria asks,
‘Have not these Negroes as much right to fight for
their freedom as you have to keep them slaves?’
He believed the time would come—</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <lg>
              <l>‘When from the gallery to the farthest seat,</l>
              <l>Slave and slave owner should no longer meet,</l>
              <l>But all sit equal at the master's feet.’”</l>
            </lg>
          </q>
          <p>In the colonies of Maryland, Delaware and Connecticut,
conditions were much the same as those recited above.
The colony of New Jersey was the only one in which the Negro
<pb id="pendle87" n="87"/>
was tried by jury, the law also requiring the presence
of three justices of the peace<sic corr=",">.</sic> though in Pennsylvania
a negro charged with murder must be tried before six
freeholders and two justices of the peace. Other humane
laws were passed, but when New Jersey passed into the
hands of the English, these laws were not regarded.</p>
          <p>Slavery was encouraged in the Carolinas from the very
beginning, but in 1690 an act more positive than any
passed by the other colonies legalized <sic corr="slavery">salvery</sic>.
A part of the act reads: “It shall be always presumed
that every Negro, Indian, Mulatto and Mustizo is a slave
unless the contrary can be made to appear,
the Indians in amity with this government excepted,
* * * Providing also, that nothing in this shall be
construed to hinder or restrain any other court of
law or equity in this province, from determining the
property of slaves or their right of freedom.” Until
1732 Georgia was included in the Carolinas.</p>
          <p>Because of the rice industry, the number of slaves increased
rapidly but their lot was an exceedingly hard one.
“They were not allowed to go to other plantations on
Sundays, fast days or holy days, even though they had
written passes; they were not allowed to hire or buy a
house or plantation; they could not own a horse, a boat
or cattle.” These oppressive laws became unbearable
and many slaves ran away; those who were caught were
beaten, branded with hot irons, suffered
other cruel punishments and often were barbarously killed.</p>
          <p>In most of the colonies in the early days education was
neglected, the whites themselves as a rule having but
little learning. In 1670, the government in England
requested an account of education in the colony of
Virginia and in his reply the governor, Sir William
Berkeley, said: “I thank God there are no free schools
nor printing and I hope we shall not have these hundred
years; for learning has brought disobedience and heresy
and sects into the world; and printing has divulged them,
and libels against the best government. God keep us from
both.” You see, that though an English peer and a college-bred
man the governor was really very ignorant as he
<pb id="pendle88" n="88"/>
had not the first idea of the true value of a sound
education. But an earnest desire for knowledge has
always been characteristic of the Negro and the slaves
in the colonies showed themselves so eager to learn and
it so often happened that white friends were willing to
teach them that in nearly every province, laws were
passed forbidding any one to teach them even to read or write.</p>
          <p>There is one thing which you must remember, dear children,
that is that always, always in every country, the Negro
has had staunch, true, courageous white friends, will
always have them, nor can we do without them. There will
ever be a larger or a smaller number who will firmly stand
for righteousness, justice and truth. So let us ever
appreciate, honor and be worthy of all our friends.</p>
          <p>Throughout the colonies there were a number of slaves who
had, in one way or another, gained freedom; in some cases
they were set free by their masters, in others by making
every spare moment count and often by working all night,
they had earned enough money to buy themselves; sometimes
their owners, dying, would leave them free. But freed
Negroes were feared and distrusted by the whites and
despised by the slaves, and many laws which worked to
their discomfort were passed. In some colonies it became
quite customary to free a slave or let him buy himself
for a small sum when old age or ill health caused him
to be no longer useful to his master. But you can see
that such a practice was almost as cruel as slavery.</p>
          <p>In the ancient cemetery at Concord, Mass., is the grave
of a slave, born in the early part of the eighteenth century,
over which is a headstone bearing the following:</p>

          <p>THE latter half of the eighteenth century is notable as
showing the first unmistakable signs of the remarkable
fitness of the Negro for modern civilization; during this<figure id="ill10" entity="pendl90"><p>PHILLIS WHEATLEY.</p></figure>
period also, began in England and America the organized
persistent efforts of the friends of the slave who were
usually called Abolitionists. During this time the colonies
fought with England and became free and independent states,
and in this war of the Revolution the Negro played, as we
shall later see, a noble part.</p>
          <pb id="pendle91" n="91"/>
          <p>You have heard that several slaves in Massachusetts entered
suit for liberty against their masters. It was a woman
who began it, Jenny Slew of Ipswich, Essex County, who sued
the man who claimed to own her in September,1775. The
case was at first decided against her, but she appealed
to the Superior Court and won her freedom and four pounds,
English money, besides. Think what a brave, determined woman
Jenny Slew must have been! Following that, many slaves
obtained freedom in like manner. After the colonies declared
themselves independent, Massachusetts adopted a constitution
in 1780, and again a woman, Elizabeth Freeman, led in suing
for liberty under the new constitution. Mr. Sedgwick, who
afterward became a United States senator, pleaded Elizabeth's
case and won it, and this is said to have been the death blow
of slavery in that colony. When the census of 1790 was taken
there were no slaves in Massachusetts.</p>
          <p>Before that time the Negroes of Massachusetts had
addressed two strong and able petitions to the legislature, the
first of which is as follows:</p>
          <p>To His Excellency, Thomas Hutchinson, Esq., Governor:</p>
          <p>“To the Honorable, His Majesty's Council, and to the Honorable
House of Representatives in general court assembled
at Boston, the 5th day of January, 1773:</p>
          <p>The humble petition of many slaves living in the town of
Boston and other towns in this province, is this namely—</p>
          <p>That Your Excellency and Honors, and the Honorable the
Representatives, would be pleased to take their unhappy state
and condition under your wise and just consideration.</p>
          <p>We desire to bless God, who loves mankind, who sent His
Son to die for their salvation, and who is no respecter of
persons, that he hath lately put it into the hearts of
multitudes, on both sides of the water, to bear our burthens,
some of whom are men of great note and influence, who have
pleaded our cause with arguments, which we hope will have
their weight with this Honorable Court.</p>
          <pb id="pendle92" n="92"/>
          <p>We presume not to dictate to your Excellency and Honors,
being willing to rest our cause on your humanity and justice,
yet would beg leave to say a word or two on the subject.</p>
          <p>Although some of the Negroes are vicious (who doubtless may be
punished and restrained by the same laws which are in
force against others of the king's subjects) there are many
others of quite a different character, and who, if made free,
would soon be able, as well as willing, to bear a part in the
public charges. Many of them of good natural parts are discreet,
sober, honest and industrious; and may it not be said
of them that they are virtuous and religious, although their
condition is, in itself, so unfriendly to religion and
every moral virtue, except patience. How many of that number
have there been and now are in this province, who had every
day of their lives embittered with this most intolerable
reflection, that, let their behavior be what it will,
neither they nor their children, to all generations, shall
ever be able to do or to possess and
enjoy anything—no, not even <hi rend="italics">life itself,</hi> but in a
manner as the <hi rend="italics">beasts</hi> that perish.</p>
          <p>We have no property! We have no wives! We have no children! We
have no city! No country! But we have a Father in heaven, and
we are determined, as far as His grace shall enable us, and
as far as our degraded condition and contemptuous life will
admit, to keep all his commandments; especially will we be
obedient to our masters, so long as God, in His sovereign 
Providence, shall <hi rend="italics">suffer</hi> us to be holden
in bondage.</p>
          <p>It would be impudent, if not presumptuous, in us to suggest
to your Excellency and Honors, any law or laws proper to be made
in relation to our unhappy state, which although our greatest
unhappiness is not our fault; and this gives us great
encouragement to pray and hope for such relief as is
consistent with your wisdom, justice and goodness.</p>
          <p>We think ourselves very happy, that we may thus address the
great and general court of this province, which great and
<pb id="pendle93" n="93"/>
good court is to us the best judge under God of what is wise,
just and good.</p>
          <p>We humbly beg leave to add but this one thing more: we
pray for such relief only, which by no possibility can ever be
productive of the least wrong or injury to our masters, but to
us will be as life from the dead.”</p>
          <p>A later petition is signed by Lancaster Hill, Brister Slenfen,
Peter Bess, Prince Hall, Jack Pierpont, Nero Funelo and Newport
Sumner. As the last three are recorded as making “their
mark,” the others were evidently able to write.</p>
          <p>Prince Hall became famous as the founder of Freemasonry
among the Negroes of America. Born in <sic corr="Barbadoes">Barnadoes</sic>, West
Indies, in 1748, he went, a youth of seventeen, to Boston and
entered at once into the life of the community. He quickly
learned to read and write and by the time he was twenty-five
was a taxpayer and a voter.</p>
          <p>In 1775 he applied for admission, and was initiated, into
British Army Lodge, No. 58, and having induced fifteen other
colored men to become initiated in the same lodge, Hall set up
with these men the African Lodge, Number 459.</p>
          <p>Speaking of Hall, a writer says: “He knew that virtue,
temperance, charity, education, justice, honor and truth
are necessary to make good citizens, which are the glory of
any community. Prince Hall's foresight led him to believe that
his race in North America, through the providence of God, would
live as one people, free and <sic corr="untrammeled">untrammelled</sic>, as to education and
rights of citizenship. He lived to see the doors of schoolhouses
opened to colored people in 1796 in Massachusetts.”</p>
          <p>Until his death, in 1807, Hall was a leader among his people,
and composed several petitions to the House of Representatives.
As a preacher he was noted for his eloquence and his
deep religious feeling.</p>
          <p>The latter part of the eighteenth century also found the
Negro with an acknowledged leader in the field of literature,
and this leader was a woman—Phillis Wheatley. When but a
<pb id="pendle94" n="94"/>
frail little girl, eight years of age, she was taken from home
and friends in Africa and brought to this country; wrapped in
a piece of soiled carpet she stood in the slave market of Boston,
when Mrs. John Wheatley, who had gone to the market
to buy a house maid saw the child. Liking the appearance of
the little girl, Mrs. Wheatley bought her intending to train her
to do housework, but the child seemed so intelligent that Mrs.
Wheatley and her daughter made the experiment of teaching
her to read and write, They were surprised and delighted
with her aptness, for within eighteen months after she had
landed in this country, the little girl whom they named Phillis
could read well. Even the most difficult portions of the Bible,
which was in those days, the great text-book of
English-speaking peoples, was easily read by Phillis.</p>
          <p>The Wheatley family was one of refinement and culture
and by contact with them and their friends, the very best that
was in Phillis was brought out. When she was twelve years
of age she was able to write and converse with great ease and
when she was seventeen her first poems were published in
pamphlet form in Boston.</p>
          <p>About this time also, in 1770, Phillis accepted the Christian
religion and though there was a law which forbade the baptising
of slaves, she was baptised in the Old South Meeting
House. About three years later the Wheatleys set Phillis free,
but she still made her home with them, for the family treated
her as a beloved daughter and she returned their affection.</p>
          <p>After obtaining a sound foundation in English, Phillis took
up the study of Latin and did so well that her translations
were favorably spoken of in London and her fame gained for
her many English friends. She had never enjoyed robust
health and when, shortly after she had been emancipated at the
age of twenty, and her physician prescribed for her a sea voyage,
she went to England, and “she carried London by storm.”
“Thoughtful people praised her, titled people dined her and
the press extolled the name of Phillis Wheatley, the African
<pb id="pendle95" n="95"/>
poetess,” and in 1773 a little book of her poems was printed
by a London publisher.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Wheatley fell ill and longed to see Phillis whom she
dearly loved, so Phillis came back to America, but Mrs.
Wheatley lived but a short while afterward, and as her husband
and her daughter soon followed her to the grave, Phillis
was left alone in the world.</p>
          <p>The fact that a slave straight from Africa was capable of
being so thoroughly trained in mind, in manners and in morals
had a great influence upon the thoughtful people of her time;
it made many friends for the Negro and encouraged those
who were already friendly.</p>
          <p>Miss Wheatley was married to John Peters, a young man
“of talents and information,” who had read law and who
owned a thriving grocery business in Court Street. But he
was not kind to Phillis and her life with him was an unhappy
one. In December, 1784, she died, “greatly beloved and sincerely
mourned by all whose good fortune it had been to know her.”</p>
          <p>Benjamin Banneker, born near what is now Ellicott City,
Maryland, was another great Negro of this period. His
mother's father was an African prince, and her mother taught
Ben to read the Bible and to learn many of its beautiful verses by
heart. There was also in the neighborhood a private school
and the teacher admitted Benjamin and several other colored
children along with the whites. Benjamin cared more for
knowledge than for play and made the most of his time in
school. Leaving school, he went to live on his father's farm
and was considered an ideal farmer, making the most of the
soil and keeping his place neatly and in order. He read every
book he could buy or borrow (books were scarce in his neighborhood
in those days), being especially inclined to mechanics,
mathematics and astronomy. In 1770, using a borrowed watch
as a model, he made a large clock which struck the hours,
kept perfect time and was the wonder of the neighborhood.
<pb id="pendle96" n="96"/>
It is said to have been the first clock of its kind that was made
in America.</p>
          <p>In 1773 he made the acquaintance of Mr. George Ellicott,
whose business firm had built a flour mill and opened a store
not far from Banneker's home. As the post office was in this
store, Benjamin went there quite often and in that way became
acquainted with the farmers and gentlemen who lived
in the surrounding country. His large stock of information
and his modest bearing made him a great favorite and he exchanged
with the learned men of the vicinity problems in
mathematics which was a favorite pastime of the period.</p>
          <p>Benjamin was given full access to the library of his friend,
Mr. George Ellicott, and the latter encouraged and urged him
to make the most of his abilities. Benjamin made great progress
in astronomy, and at the suggestion of Mr. Ellicott he compiled
an almanac for Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia and
Maryland. In 1791 he sent a written copy of his Almanac to
Thomas Jefferson, together with a long letter pleading for the
Negro and begging that his own accomplishments, however
humble, might be taken as a sign of what the Negro could do
if given opportunity and encouragement. Mr. Jefferson's
reply was most courteous, and he informed Banneker that he
had sent the Almanac to scientific friends in Paris, as it deserved
wide publication. This Almanac was in manuscript,
but the next year Banneker had his Almanac printed and after
that they appeared each year until his death.</p>
          <p>Benjamin Banneker was invited to assist the men who laid
out the boundaries of the District of Columbia, and his qualities
of mind and modest, dignified deportment made a great
impression upon the other surveyors. He died at his home in
the year 1804, the most renowned and intelligent Negro of
this time, honored by all who knew him in America and
Europe.</p>
          <p>Connecticut furnished a noted Negro to the closing days of
the eighteenth century, in the person of Lemuel Haynes, who
was born in Hartford in 1753. He was educated for the ministry
<pb id="pendle97" n="97"/>
and was famous for his Biblical knowledge, his brilliant,
eloquent sermons and his forceful arguments. About 1788, he
made his home in Vermont where, as a preacher he was well
known and very popular. In 1804 Haynes received from
Middlebury College the honorary degree of A. M.</p>
          <p>Other famous ministers of the period were Absalom Jones,
who in 1792 founded in Philadelphia, St. Thomas Episcopal
Church. This was the first colored church of that denomination
in America, and Absalom remained its rector for about
twenty years.</p>
          <p>In New York City the Zion branch of the African Methodist
Episcopal Church was organized by James Varick, William
Miller, Abraham Thompson, and in Philadelphia, Richard Allen
and his friends organized in an old blacksmith shop, the
first church of the African Methodist Episcopal body.</p>
          <p>John Cuffee, born in Africa, and sold as a slave in Massachusetts,
stands out in bright colors for wealth, intelligence
and progressiveness. “After he learned the English language,
he turned his thoughts to freedom and in a few years, by working
beyond the hours he devoted to his master, was enabled
to buy himself.”</p>
          <p>By working and saving Cuffe was, in a few years, able to
buy a farm of one hundred acres, near New Bedford, where
his Christian character, his devotion to learning and his great
business ability caused him to be respected by all. He was
married to an Indian woman and one of their ten children
was Captain Paul Cuffe of whom you have read in the talk
on Sierra Leone.</p>
          <p>In our day there are many distinguished Negro physicians,
of whom we are justly proud. In the latter part of the eighteenth
century there was but one in the whole country—Dr.
James Derham. He was born a slave in Philadelphia in 1762
and his master taught him to read and write and to assist him
in the making of medicines, for in those days doctors compounded
themselves most of the medicines which they prescribed.
Though the master was as kind as he knew how to
<pb id="pendle98" n="98"/>
be, he did not free Derham, and the latter, upon the death of
his owner, was sold to a surgeon in the 16th British Regiment.</p>
          <p>The surgeon sold Derham at the close of the Revolutionary
War to Dr. Robert Dove of New Orleans. Dr. Dove appreciated
the ability of James and allowed him to buy his freedom
in a short time. Dr. James Derham then opened an office of
his own and gained a large practice. In 1789, when Derham
was only 27 years old, a white physician of Philadelphia
wrote a very complimentary article concerning him to a scientific
journal of the period. Dr. Derham is said to have spoken
the Spanish and French languages and to have been regarded
as one of the most able physicians of his day in the city of
New Orleans.</p>
          <p>In 1770, the year in which Phillis Wheatley's poems were
first published and Benjamin Banneker was making his clock,
the Negro race gave to the cause of American freedom the first
martyr—Crispus Attucks.</p>
          <p>Trouble with England had been brewing for some years and
the British soldiers in Boston and elsewhere treated the Americans
with insult and contempt, while the governors of the Colonies,
who were natives of England and appointed by the
crown, sympathized with the soldiers.</p>
          <p>Attucks, who twenty years before ran away from his master
who lived in Framingham, had later come to Boston and had
become intensely interested in the quarrel between England
and America. On one occasion he addressed the following
letter to Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <text>
              <body>
                <div1>
                  <salute>“To Thomas Hutchinson,</salute>
                  <p>Sir: You will hear from us with astonishment. You ought
to hear from us with horror. You are chargeable before God
and man, with our blood. The soldiers were but passive instruments,
mere machines; neither moral nor voluntary agents
in our destruction, more than the leaden pellets with which we
were wounded. You were a free agent. You acted coolly,
deliberately, with all that premeditated malice, not against us in
particular, but against the people in general, which, in the sight
<pb id="pendle99" n="99"/>
of the law, is an ingredient in the composition of murder. You
will hear further from us hereafter.</p>
                  <signed>Crispus Attucks.”</signed>
                </div1>
              </body>
            </text>
          </q>
          <p>There were several riots in the streets of Boston on Monday,
March 5, 1770, between the citizens and the soldiers, the
latter going from place to place trying to arouse the anger of
the citizens. “Fresh, wet snow had fallen and frost had covered
the streets with a coat of ice. The moon was in its first
quarter and shed a pale light over the town, when at twilight,
both citizens and soldiers began to assemble in the streets. By
seven o'clock fully seven hundred persons, armed with clubs
and other weapons were on King (now State) Street and,
provoked by the insolence and brutality of the lawless soldiery,
shouted: “Let us drive out the rascals! They have no business
here; drive them out!” At the barracks on Brattle Street the
soldiers rushed out, and leveling their muskets, threatened to
make a lane paved with dead men through the crowd.</p>
          <p>The excitement all over the city grew more and more intense
and when a detachment of soldiers under Captain Preston,
officer of the day, encountered a crowd of citizens near
the Custom House the soldiers were pelted with snowballs
and ice. Crispus Attucks, leader of the citizens, accused the
soldiers of cowardice and urging the citizens to attack them,
he rushed forward, seized one of the guns and was almost
immediately shot. Samuel Gray and Jonas Caldwell were also
killed, while Patrick Carr and Samuel Maverick were mortally
wounded.</p>
          <p>News of the tragedy spread over the town in a few minutes.
It was now near midnight. There was a light in every house,
for few besides children had retired on that fearful night in
Boston. The alarm bells were rung; drums beat to arms. A
cry went through the streets, “The soldiers are murdering the
people. To arms! To arms! Turn out with your guns!” Preston
also ordered his drums to beat to arms. But the colonel of
the regiment and the lieutenant-governor promised the citizens
that justice should be vindicated and order was restored.</p>
          <pb id="pendle100" n="100"/>
          <p>As Attucks and Caldwell were without relatives in the city,
their bodies were carried to Faneuil Hall, so justly called the
“Cradle of Liberty,” and from there they were buried. The
hearses met those containing the bodies of Gray and Maverick
in King Street, and from thence the procession moved in columns
six deep with a long line of coaches, containing the first
citizens of Boston. The obsequies were witnessed by a very
large and respectful concourse of people. The bodies were
deposited in one grave, over which a stone was placed bearing
this inscription:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <lg>
              <l>“Long as in Freedom's cause the wise contend,</l>
              <l>Dear to your country shall your fame extend;</l>
              <l>While to the world the lettered stone shall tell</l>
              <l>Where Caldwell, Attucks, Gray and Maverick fell.”</l>
            </lg>
          </q>
          <p>The murder of Crispus Attucks and his comrades was called
the Boston Massacre. Although in those days there were
neither steam cars, electric cars, telegraph nor telephone, the
news of the massacre spread like wild-fire through the colonies.
The feeling of indignation and resentment which the
affair aroused did much to unite the people. A statesman of
the period said, long afterward: “Not the battle of Lexington
or Bunker Hill, nor the surrender of Burgoyne or Cornwallis,
were more important events in American history than the battle
of King Street, on the fifth of March, 1770. The death of
four or five persons, the most obscure and inconsiderable that
could have been found upon the continent, has never yet been
forgiven in any part of America.”</p>

          <pb id="pendle101" n="101"/>
          <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
          <head>THE NEGRO IN THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.</head>
          <p>BESIDES the achievements noted in the foregoing chapter
the Negro played a courageous and distinguished part
in the War for American Independence. By this time
there were many free Negroes in the colonies; besides those<figure id="ill11" entity="pendl101"><p>NEGROES IN THE BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL.</p></figure>
who had been able to buy themselves and those who had
obtained their liberty by other means, a number of men had
been freed for brave conduct shown during the Indian and
French wars. From the very beginning these men stood ready
to fight with the Americans.</p>
          <p>At the battle of Bunker Hill, when the English leader, Major
Pitcairn, suddenly appeared before the American breastworks,
calling upon the colonists to surrender and exclaiming to his
followers, “The day is ours,” for a few moments the Americans
were dumbfounded and neither answered nor fired. “At
<pb id="pendle102" n="102"/>
this critical moment a Negro soldier stepped forward, and
aiming his musket directly at the major's bosom, blew him
through,” thus checking temporarily the advance of the British.</p>
          <p>The Negro who so distinguished himself was Peter Salem,
an ex-slave of Framingham, the place where Crispus Attucks
had lived. Salem served for seven years in the Continental
army and came out of the war unharmed. He received many
honors during his life and died at Framingham in 1816.</p>
          <p>Salem Poor was another who was known as a brave and
gallant soldier. He fought in the battle of Bunker Hill and in
other engagements and the officers under whom he served sent
a petition concerning him to Congress in which they state that
Salem Poor had “behaved in battle like an experienced officer,
as well as an excellent soldier,” and that “the reward due
to so great and distinguished a character, we submit to
Congress.”</p>
          <p>Not only the freedmen but the slaves were anxious to help
the colonists, the latter feeling that if they loyally assisted
their masters to throw off the British yoke there would be a chance
of securing also their own freedom. But the Committee of
Safety early decided that slaves should not be allowed to enlist,
and any who had attached themselves to the army were
ordered to be returned to their masters.</p>
          <p>Many masters in the northern colonies offered to free their
slaves, hoping thereby to strengthen the army. The southerners
objected to that and the whole subject of allowing the Negro
in the army was warmly debated, by the delegates from the
northern and southern colonies. A committee which included
Benjamin Franklin, Benjamin Harrison and Thomas Lynch
with the deputy governors of Connecticut and Rhode Island,
met a committee of the Council of Massachusetts Bay and it
was agreed “That the Negroes be rejected altogether.”</p>
          <p>Later General Washington advised that the free Negroes
who had served faithfully in the army at Cambridge might
reenlist therein, but no others. “The General was induced to
take this action by a committee of freemen, headed by Prince
<pb id="pendle103" n="103"/>
Hall, who went to headquarters and laid their case before the
commander-in-chief.”</p>
          <p>While the Americans were divided as to allowing the Negro
to enlist, the English were offering freedom to all who would
join them, and in many colonies, especially in Virginia, South
Carolina and New York, many slaves flocked to the British
standard. General Washington saw that this would prove a
serious blow to the cause of the Americans, especially in the
south. To take the Negroes out of the field, from raising
produce for the army and place them in front of patriots as
opposing soldiers, he saw was a danger that should be averted.
And so the matter was discussed backward and forward and
decided first one way then another.</p>
          <p>“In the south the dread in which the colonists held the Negro
was equal to that with which they regarded the Indians. The
incendiary torch, massacre, pillage and revolt were ever presenting
to their minds a gloomy and disastrous picture. Their
dreams at night, their thoughts by day, in the field and in the
legislative hall, were how to keep the Negro down. If one
should be seen in a village with a gun, a half score of white
men would run and take it from him, while the women in the
street would take shelter in the nearest house. The wrongs
which they continued to practice upon him were a terror to
them through their conscience, though then, as in later years,
many, and particularly the leaders, endeavored to impress
others with their feigned belief of the natural inferiority of the
Negro to themselves. This doctrine served them, as the whistle
did the boy in the woods; they talked in that way simply to
keep their courage up and their conscience down.”</p>
          <p>Although the southerners, as a whole, opposed the enlistment
of Negroes, there were among them wise and farseeing individuals
who advocated it. Prominent among the latter were
the Hon. Henry Laurens and his son, Col. John Laurens, of
South Carolina. Colonel Laurens had acted as aid-de-camp to
General Washington and his services in Rhode Island and elsewhere
had given him a chance to correctly value the Negro as
<pb id="pendle104" n="104"/>
a soldier. He spent much energy, time and thought in an
endeavor to have the people of his native section agree to the
enlistment of Negroes. Until his death he urged upon his
southern countrymen the advisability of this step, but in vain.</p>
          <p>Meantime, both north and south, Negroes were attaching
themselves to the American army in various capacities, always
earning the respect of their comrades. They realized, as you
have read in the petition of the Boston Negroes, that the
arguments, which led their masters to fight applied much more
truly to themselves and they hoped by meritorious conduct to
compel their owners to see as they did. “The Negro's ancestors
were not slaves, so upon the altar of their hearts the fire of
liberty was rekindled by the utterances of the white colonists.”</p>
          <p>The distressing condition of the American army at the close
of the campaign of 1777, when it lay at Valley Forge and
many soldiers for want of shoes walked barefoot on the frozen
ground; few, if any, had blankets for the night, and great
numbers sickened, caused the authorities to welcome strong
and able-bodied men. Those who favored the enlistment of
the Negro again began to plead for him. Before the close of
the war many Negroes were enlisted in the companies of the
southern colonies, but Rhode Island was the only colony which
had an entire regiment of Negroes.</p>
          <p>In Connecticut a Negro company was organized and David
Humphreys, a gallant Negro, became the captain. Congress
commissioned him as lieutenant colonel in November 1782
with the order that his commission should date from the 23rd
of June 1780, when he received his appointment as aid-de-camp
to the commander-in-chief. Colonel Humphreys served until
the close of the war.</p>
          <p>In Massachusetts and in some of the other northern colonies
friends of the Negro insisted that there should be no separate
companies, hoping in that way to overcome race prejudice,
consequently there is but a fragmentary record of the deeds
of Negro soldiers. Following are the names of some who gave
<sic corr="praiseworthy">praiseworhy</sic> service:</p>
          <pb id="pendle105" n="105"/>
          <p>Ebenezer Hill was a slave at Stonington, Conn., who served
throughout the war and who took part in the battles of Saratoga
and Stillwater, and witnessed the surrender of Burgoyne.</p>
          <p>Prince Whipple acted as bodyguard to General Whipple, one
of Washington's aids. Prince is the Negro seen on horseback
in the engraving of Washington crossing the Delaware, and
again pulling the stroke oar in the boat in which Washington
crossed. “Deborah Gannett, a Negro woman enlisted in the
Fourth Massachusetts Regiment in disguise, under the name
of Robert Shurtliff in 1782, and served a year and a half, for
which the General Court paid her thirty-four pounds sterling
in 1792.”</p>
          <p>“At the storming of Fort Griswold Major Montgomery was
lifted upon the walls of the fort by his soldiers and called upon
the Americans to surrender. John Freeman, a Negro soldier,
with his pike, pinned him dead to the earth. Among the American
soldiers who were massacred by the British soldiers, after
the surrender of the fort were two Negro soldiers, Lambo
Latham and Jordan Freeman.</p>
          <p>“Quack Matrick, a Negro, fought through the Revolutionary War,
as a soldier, for which he was pensioned. Also Jonathan Overtin,
who was in the Battle of Yorktown. Simon Lee, of Virginia, and Major
Jeffrey, of <sic corr="Tennessee">Tennesse</sic>, also rendered excellent service.”</p>
          <p>Following is an interesting account of an aged Negro patriot
from the Burlington Gazette, written in the early nineteenth
century: “The attention of many of our citizens has doubtless
been arrested by the appearance of an old colored man who
might have been seen sitting in front of his residence in east
Union street respectfully raising his hat to those who might be
passing by. His attenuated frame, his silvered head, his feeble
movements, combine to prove that he is very aged, and yet
comparatively few are aware that he is among the survivors
of the gallant army who fought for the liberties of our country.</p>
          <p>“On Monday last we stopped to speak to him, and ask how
old he was. He asked the day of the month, and upon being
<pb id="pendle106" n="106"/>
told that it was the 24th of May replied with trembling lips,
‘I am very old; I am a hundred years old today.’</p>
          <p>“His name is Oliver Cromwell, and he says that he was
born at the Black Horse (now Columbus) in this county, in
the family of John Hutchins. He enlisted in a company commanded
by Captain Lowry, attached to the Second New Jersey
Regiment, under the command of Col. Israel Shreve. He was
at the battles of Trenton, Brandywine, Princeton, Monmouth
and Yorktown, at which latter place he saw the last man killed.
Although his faculties are failing, yet he relates many interesting
reminiscences of the Revolution. He was with the army
at the retreat of the Delaware, on the memorable crossing of
the 25th of December, 1776, and relates the story of the battle
on the succeeding day with enthusiasm. He gives the details
of the march from Trenton to Princeton, and told us, with
much humor that they ‘knocked the British around lively’ at
the latter place.”</p>
          <p>“Cromwell was brought up with a farmer, having served
his time with Thomas Hutchins. He was for six years and
nine months under the immediate command of Washington,
whom he loved affectionately. His discharge, at the close of
the war was in Washington's own handwriting, of which he
was very proud, often speaking of it. He received annually
ninety-six dollars pension. His long life was an honorable
one.”</p>
          <p>The census for 1775 gave the slave population as follows:
Connecticut, 5,000; Delaware, 9,000; Georgia, 16,000; Maryland,
80,000; Massachusetts, 3,500; New Hampshire, 629;
North Carolina, 75,000; New York, 15,000; New Jersey,
7,600; Pennsylvania, 10,000; Rhode Island, 4,373; South <sic corr="Carolina">Caroline</sic>,
110,000; Virginia, 165,000. By the end of the eighteenth
century, Massachusetts and Vermont had freed their slaves,
but many of the other colonies had increased their holdings.</p>
          <p>So that in spite of the distinguished services which Negro
soldiers and sailors gave to their country, in spite of the
expectations of the slaves and their friends, the close of the
<pb id="pendle107" n="107"/>
war brought little relief; indeed many who had fought with
great Bravery were returned to slavery, and the beginning of
the nineteenth century found hope almost dead in the breast of
slaves. Almost, but not entirely, for there have always been
those among us whose faith and trust in God has never wavered
and whose belief in the final triumph of justice and right
has remained unshaken.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
          <head>THE NEGRO IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.</head>
          <p>What is called the “Negro Problem” has occupied the time
and thought of Americans from the very beginning of the existence
of the United States. True patriots have never doubted
what was best to do with the Negro—simply to treat him as<figure id="ill12" entity="pendl108"><p>NEGRO SAILORS IN THE WAR OF 1812.</p></figure>
any other human being, to give him every opportunity and
encouragement, and to demand of him strict obedience to the
same laws which equally apply to other men. But, alas, how
small a proportion of true patriots and statesmen has this
country so far produced! How few who comprehend that
naught but good can come to the individual or the nation that
persistently deals justice and righteousness!</p>
          <p>The convention of delegates which met in New York in
May, 1787, and over which George Washington presided,
agreed, after a heated debate, upon a compromise by which
<pb id="pendle109" n="109"/>
the merchants of the northern states were to have the shipping
privileges (they owned most of the ships) and the southern
rice-planters were to have the privileges of importing slaves
from Africa or elsewhere during a period of twenty years;
all the colonies but North Carolina, South Carolina and
Georgia had previously passed laws against the importation of
slaves.</p>
          <p>At the close of the Revolutionary War, the people began to
move from the older colonies and to spread out to the south
and west. It was not long before the dwellers in the newly
settled territory began to apply to Congress for admission into
the Union. At once began the struggle between the Abolitionists
and those who desired to perpetuate slavery; the former
saw slavery to be a curse upon the land and people, the latter
could think of nothing but the labor which they could wring
from the slave and the wealth it would bring them.</p>
          <p>Most of the New England and Middle States had passed laws for
gradual emancipation and in New York, New Jersey
and Pennsylvania the Quakers worked without ceasing for universal
emancipation. In 1799, when Kentucky revised her constitution,
Henry Clay, then a young man, made a brilliant speech in favor of
gradual emancipation in the state, but in spite of his eloquence,
the clause was not inserted. Up to 1802 Georgia included all the
territory that is now Alabama and Mississippi; in April of that year,
with the provisions that slavery should be allowed, Georgia ceded the
territory and “Alabama and Mississippi became the most cruel slave
states in the Union.”</p>
          <p>The following census for 1810 will show that though slavery
had decreased in some parts of the Union it had greatly increased
in other parts since 1775: District of Columbia, 5,395;
Rhode Island, 108; Connecticut, 310; Pennsylvania, 795;
Delaware, 4,177; New Jersey, 10,851; New York, 15,017; Louisiana,
34,660; Tennessee 44,535; Kentucky, 80,561; Georgia,
105,218; Maryland, 111,502; North Carolina, 168,824; South
<pb id="pendle110" n="110"/>
Carolina, 196,365; Virginia, 392,518; Mississippi Territory,
17,088; Indiana Territory, 237; Louisiana Territory, 3,011;
Illinois Territory, 168; Michigan Territory, 24.</p>
          <p>When war was declared with Great Britain in 1812, Negroes
offered themselves as soldiers, but at first few were accepted;
it is said, however, that about one-tenth of the crews of the
war vessels were Negroes, and that they fought bravely in all
the battles on the Great Lakes. New York raised two colored
regiments. After the British had captured Washington,
burned the Capitol, President's house and many other public
buildings and threatened Baltimore, an English fleet suddenly
appeared outside New Orleans.</p>
          <p>General Andrew Jackson, commander of the army of the
southwest, issued a call for free Negroes as soldiers, in which
he said: “Through a mistaken policy you have heretofore been
deprived of a participation in the glorious struggle for national
rights in which our country is engaged. This shall no
longer exist. * * * As sons of freedom you are now called
upon to defend our most inestimable blessing. As Americans,
your country looks with confidence to her adopted children
for a valorous support, as a faithful return for the advantages
enjoyed under her mild and equitable government. As fathers,
husbands, and brothers, you are summoned to rally around the
standard of the eagle, to defend all which is dear in existence.”</p>
          <p>Of course the brave Negroes responded (five hundred of
them) and were organized into two battalions. On December
18th, 1814, when General Jackson reviewed his forces, his address
to the Negroes was as follows: “Soldiers, from the
shores of Mobile I collected you to arms. I invited you to
share in the perils and to divide the glory of your white countrymen.
I expected much from you; for I was not uninformed
of those qualities which must render you so formidable to an
invading foe. I knew that you could endure hunger and thirst,
and all the hardships of war, I knew that you loved the land
of your nativity, and that, like ourselves, you had to defend
<pb id="pendle111" n="111"/>
all that is most dear to man. But you surpass my hopes. I
have found in you, united to these qualities, that noble enthusiasm
which impels to great deeds.</p>
          <p>“Soldiers, the President of the United States shall be informed
of your conduct on the present occasion; and the voice
of the Representatives of the American nation shall applaud
your valor, as your general now praises your ardor. The
enemy is near. His sails cover the lakes, but the brave are
united, and if he finds us contending among ourselves, it will
be for the prize of valor, and fame its noblest reward.”</p>
          <p>The Negroes behaved gallantly and the Black heroes of the
battle of New Orleans were loudly applauded at home and
abroad, but the noise of the slave marts soon silenced this
praise and nowhere were the laws more rigidly enforced
against the Negroes, both slave and free, than in Louisiana.
Nor did gratitude affect the lot of the slave in any state where
slavery existed.</p>
          <p>It is said that about this time a gang of slaves were being
driven through Washington on the Fourth of July. The city
was gaily decorated, cannon were booming, drums beating and
flags flying under shadow of the dome of the Capitol of this
“mild and equitable” government. One of the men lifted his
hands, loaded with irons, toward the flag and sang in bitter
irony, “Hail Columbia! Happy Land.”</p>
          <p>The bravery of the Negro and the injustice and cruelty with
which he was treated filled the hearts of humane white people
with pity for him and with determination to help him. As you
know, the Quakers or Friends have always been foremost
among the lovers of justice and mercy. Though uniformly
kind to their slaves when convinced of the wickedness of the
system, they had freed their slaves by the hundreds and wherever
possible had caused the passage of immediate or gradual
emancipation laws.</p>
          <p>Anthony Benezet was a Frenchman by birth, who had settled
in Philadelphia and joined the Society of Friends. He
<pb id="pendle112" n="112"/>
was a “reasoning, eloquent, learned and eager denouncer of
slavery and the slave trade and published several works on the
subject.” He wrote to Queen Charlotte and interested her in
the matter and also corresponded with Granville Sharpe and
other members of the Abolition Society in England.</p>
          <p>In 1750 he established in Philadelphia the first school for
colored people in the state and “taught it himself, without
money and without price.” He said, “I can, with truth and
sincerity, declare that I have found among the Negroes as
great variety of talents as among a like number of whites, and
I am bold to assert that the notion entertained by some that the
blacks are inferior in their capacity is a vulgar prejudice,
founded on the pride or ignorance of their lordly masters, who
have kept their slaves at such a distance as to be unable to
form a right judgment of them.” In January, 1770,
through his influence was appointed a special committee of
Friends who sought to employ an instructor to teach (not more
than thirty at one time) Negro children “in the first rudiments
of school learning and in sewing and knitting.” Benezet died
May 3rd, 1784, greatly mourned, especially by the Negroes to
whom he had proven so kind and true a friend.</p>
          <p>Another Quaker, Benjamin Lundy, talked and wrote without
ceasing against slavery; he traveled from place to place
and as he journeyed, he preached his doctrine and distributed
his paper, “The Genius of Universal Emancipation,” which he
had established in 1821. “He raised his voice against slave
keeping in Virginia, Ohio, Tennessee, Maryland and the District
of Columbia, and once he made a tour of the Free States,
like another Apostle Paul, stirring up the love of the brethren
for those who were in bonds, lecturing, obtaining subscribers
for his paper, writing editorials, getting them printed where
he could, stopping by the wayside to read his proof, and directing
and mailing his papers at the nearest post office; then,
packing up his column rules, type, heading and direction book,
he would journey on, a lone, solitary Friend.”</p>
          <pb id="pendle113" n="113"/>
          <p>Lundy's paper reached the editorial desk of an enthusiastic
young man away up in Bennington, Vermont. The latter was
William Lloyd Garrison, who was publishing a paper called the
Journal of the Times. He had been advocating the principles
of Peace and Temperance, and to those he now added “an intense
hatred for slavery.” Garrison secured many names to a
petition to Congress to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia,
as that territory was, and is, under Congressional control.</p>
          <p>Lundy was so pleased with Garrison's forceful writings and
original methods, that he went to Bennington to see him. You
can imagine how both enjoyed that conference, for up to that
time the number of people who felt as they did were comparatively
few. Garrison consented to go to Baltimore and edit the
Genius of Universal Emancipation and Lundy was to sell the
paper and attend to other details.</p>
          <p>Garrison had not long been in <sic corr="Baltimore">Balitmore</sic> when he witnessed
the shipping of a load of slaves for the New Orleans market.
The heart-rending scenes, as husbands and wives, parents and
children were torn from each other, probably to meet no more,
made a deep impression upon the young editor. He published
in his paper such a scathing article upon the subject that he
was arrested for libel and thrown into prison, while a large
sum was demanded as bail.</p>
          <p>When finally released he came out of prison more than ever
the unfaltering, <sic corr="implacable">implicable</sic> enemy to slavery. Before this the
cause of Abolition had lacked leadership; it now found in Garrison
a leader in every way fitted for the task. He determined
to go to Boston, the birthplace of Liberty, and there he published
his new paper, the Liberator. Speaking of his purpose,
he said: “Let Southern oppressors tremble; let their secret
abettors tremble; let all the enemies of the persecuted Black
tremble.” “I am aware that many object to the severity of
my language, but is there not cause for severity?” “I am in
earnest. I will not equivocate; I will not excuse; I will not
retreat a single inch, AND I WILL BE HEARD.”</p>

          <p>William Lloyd Garrison kept his vow and lived to see the cruel system of
slavery crushed to death and the oppressed Negro set free. Among the
first subscribers to the Liberator was James Forten, a colored man of
Philadelphia, who gave fifty dollars.</p>
          <p>There is a long list of noble women and men who took active part in
the Abolition movement; among them were: Wendell Phillips, Charles Sumner,
Gerrit Smith, James G. Birney, Myron Hally, Beriah Greene, Samuel Green,
Lewis and Arthur Tappan, John P. Hale, John G. Saxe, Owen Lovejoy, Benjamin
Ward, Joshua R. Giddings, S. J. Chase, Jas. M. Fitch, Chas. G. Finney, W. A.

Seward, Edward and Samuel H. Blake, Frederick Seward, Jas. H. Wilson,
Lucretia Mott and Professor Goldwin Smith. Of some of the Negroes who
were prominent Abolitionists, you shall hear later.</p>
          <p>While the Abolitionists were striving for emancipation, with tongue and pen,
the lot of the slave became so unbearable in some places that some of them
plotted to kill their masters and gain freedom in that way. It is very possible that
they had heard of what had been accomplished in Haiti; at any rate, in 1800,
a Negro named General Gabriel planned an uprising by which he hoped to take
possession of the city of Richmond.</p>
          <p>He expected to bring together eleven hundred men and they were to meet
at a brook about six miles from the city, where the force was to be divided
into three parts. The attack was to be made at night, “the right wing was to
fall suddenly upon the penitentiary (which had been turned into all arsenal)
and sieze the arms; the left wing was to capture the powder house and the two
columns were to supply the third with arms. The third column was to divide and
enter the town (which at the time had only about eight thousand inhabitants) from
both ends, while the other two columns were to act as reserves.”</p>
          <p>The plan failed and the leaders were punished, but the effort caused a great
commotion throughout the country and the insurrection was pointed out as one
of the evil results of slavery.</p>
          <p>In 1822, Denmark Vescy, Peter Poyas and others plotted for an uprising in
Charleston, S. C. It is said that hundreds of Negroes were in the plot and that it
extended for fifty miles around the city; the leaders made a point of enlisting no
one who was talkative or intemperate, and house servants were not welcomed.
It was through one of the latter, however, that the plan was betrayed and the
leaders captured and executed. They died without revealing the details of their plan.</p>
          <p>Nathaniel Turner was born in Southampton County, Virginia, October 2nd, 1800,
just about one month after “General” Gabriel's plot was discovered. His father was a preacher and
<pb id="pendle116" n="116"/>
his mother a very pious woman, who believed the Old Testament Scriptures
would again be fulfilled in her day and that her little son was to be a prophet
and a “Moses” for his people. She taught him to believe this, also, when he was very young and she urged him to prepare himself for his mission. Consequently Nat grew up with serious thoughts; he took no part in the social life of his acquaintances; it is said he never laughed, but whenever he could he would go off into the woods or the mountains where he could be alone. His grandmother
also encouraged Nat in peculiar thoughts and actions and the name of Nat Turner
was known to the Negroes for miles and miles around as that of a leader and prophet.</p>
          <p>Finally, like Joan of Arc, Nat declared that he heard spirit voices which told him
that the time had come to strike a blow for the freedom of his people. He summoned four men whom he could trust, and without weapons they started on the night of August 21st, 1831, to kill, with their own weapons, all the white people in the neighborhood. They succeeded in reaching nine plantations and killing fifty-one
persons,  when the alarm was sounded and companies of infantry and cavalry
were soon on the scene.</p>
          <p>The name of Nat's four friends were Hark Travers, Samuel
Edwards, Henry Porter and Nelson Williams; on their way
to the first plantation they were joined by a man named
“Will,” whose master had treated him with great cruelty and
had sold his wife to the traders. Will armed himself with a
sharp broad-ax and with it killed several people. When the
militia arrived he would not surrender, but fought to the last
and when dying asked that his ax be buried with him.</p>
          <p>Nat, with one or two, escaped to the swamps, where they remained for more
than two months. When he had surrendered and was brought to trial, he pleaded
“Not guilty,” and insisted to the last that God had called him to do what he did.</p>
          <p>Mr. Gray, the white gentleman to whom Nat explained his visions and belief,
said of him: “It has been said that he was ignorant and cowardly, and that his object was to murder and
<pb id="pendle117" n="117"/>
rob, for the purpose of obtaining money to make his escape. It is notorious that
he was never known to have a dollar in his life, to swear an oath, or to drink a drop
of spirits. As to his ignorance, he certainly never had the advantages of
education, but he can read and write, and for natural intelligence and quickness
of apprehension, is surpassed by few men I have ever seen. As to his being a coward,
his reason as given for not resisting Mr. Phipps shows the decision of his character.
When he saw Mr. Phipps present his gun, he said he knew it was impossible for him
to escape, as the woods were full of men; he therefore thought it was
better for him to surrender and trust to fortune for his escape.”</p>
          <p>“He is a complete fanatic, or plays the part most admirably. On other subjects
he possesses all uncommon share of intelligence, with a mind capable of attaining
anything, but warped and perverted by the influence of early impressions. He is
below the ordinary stature, though strong and active, having the true Negro face,
every feature of which is strongly marked. I shall not attempt to describe
the effect of his narrative, as told and commented upon by himself in the condemned
hole of the prison; the calm, deliberate composure with which he of his late deeds
and intentions; the expression of his fiend-like face, when excited by enthusiasm;
still bearing the stains of the blood of helpless innocence about him, clothed with rags
and covered with chains, yet daring to raise his manacled hands to Heaven with a spirit
soaring above the attributes of man. I looked on him and the blood curdled in my veins.”</p>
          <p>Nat Turner was tried and sentenced to be hanged, and the sentence was carried out
at Jerusalem, Southampton County, 1831.</p>
          <p>As you have heard, whenever a territory applied to Congress for admission into the
Union as a state the question as to whether the state should be a free or a slave
state always brought on an earnest discussion. When Missouri applied the
<pb id="pendle118" n="118"/>
question was voted up and voted down in the House and Senate for nearly three
years. Finally, it was agreed that Missouri should be admitted as a slave state, but
that all lands lying north of latitude 36 degrees, 30 minutes should be forever free
and this agreement was known as the Missouri Compromise. Remember this for
you will hear more of it later.</p>
          <p>Many earnest people thought that to send the Negro back to Africa was the best way
to solve the problem, and so the American Colonization Society was formed with
branches in many states. A number of slave holders freed their slaves that they
might return to their native land. You have already heard something of the work
of the Colonization Society in Liberia.</p>
          <p>What was called the Underground Railroad was not run under the ground nor
was it a railroad. It was the name given to the friends, both colored and white,
of the Negro, whose homes formed a chain of stopping places or “stations” between
the slave states and Canada where slavery did not exist.</p>
          <p>A large volume has been written of the exciting events and the hairbreadth escapes
which they experienced who sought freedom through the Underground Railroad.
A large number of the members of the U. G. R. R. were Quakers, and all who took
part in it were people of great kindness and compassion, intelligence and ingenuity.
Sometimes men slaves were disguised as women, sometimes women disguised
as men; persons of fair complexion passed themselves off as the owners of the
darker skinned runaways; some with the help of friends, were nailed up in boxes
and sent as freight, and the whole story of the U. G. R. R. showed how many and
how good were the white friends of the Negro during this period.</p>
          <p>We have had in this chapter a sketch of what was done for and against the
Negro in the first half of the nineteenth century; in the next chapter we shall hear
of what the Negro did for himself during the same space of time.</p>

          <p>AT THIS period (1800-50) the Negroes were beginning to
better understand the benefits of united action, and their
white friends gave them all possible support and encouragement.<figure id="ill13" entity="pendl119"><p>BISHOP RICHARD ALLEN<lb/>Founder of the African Methodist Episcopal Church</p></figure>
A number of Philadelphia Negroes presented, in 1800, through Mr. Waln,
the delegate, a petition to Congress calling attention to the unlawful dealing in
slaves which was going on between several American ports and Guinea, and
stating that a number of freedmen had been kidnapped and
<pb id="pendle120" n="120"/>
sold into slavery. The southern delegates were very indignant that such a petition
should have been presented. However, the petition was finally referred to a
committee which brought in a bill forbidding American vessels to carry slaves
from this country to foreign markets.</p>
          <p>The Negroes of Philadelphia were thoughtful and progressive and in 1817, they
held a local convention to protest against the plans of the American Colonization
Society. In 1830 Rev. Richard Allen, Junius C. Morel, James C. Cornish, Cyrus
Black, and Benjamin Pascal requested the free people in the several states to send
delegates to a meeting called for September 20, 1830. The purpose of the meeting
was to discuss ways and means for the establishment of a colony in upper Canada.
The delegates met and recommended that a parent society be formed with branches
in different towns and money be raised to buy a tract of land for the proposed colony.
Agents were sent to Canada to see if the plan would be advisable. Some of the
States had already passed laws forcing the free Negroes to leave and many of these
exiles had made their home in Canada.</p>
          <p>Consequently what was called the “First Annual Convention of the People of Color”
met in Philadelphia, June 6-11, 1831, in the Wesleyan Church on Lombard street.
The delegates were as follows: Philadelphia, John Bowers, Dr. Belfast Burton,
James Cornish, Junius C. Morel, William Whipper. New York, Rev. William Miller,
Henry Sipkins, Thomas L. Jennings, William Hamilton, James Pennington; Maryland,
Rev. Abner Coker, Robert Cowley; Delaware, Abraham D. Shad, Robert Cowley;
Virginia, William Duncan. The officers chosen were: President, John Bowers;
vice presidents, Abraham D. Shad, William Duncan; secretary, William Whipper;
assistant secretary, Thomas L. Jennings. The stated purpose of the meeting was to
discuss the general condition of free Negroes.</p>
          <p>A committee made a report in which those who were engaged
in the Canadian settlement were praised and urged to continue
<pb id="pendle121" n="121"/>
the work; and among other things, the virtues of education, temperance and
economy were recommended to the race. “The convention attracted public attention
on account of the intelligence, order and excellent judgment which prevailed.
It deeply touched the young white men who had, but a few months previous, enlisted
under the broad banner William Lloyd Garrison had given to the breeze.”</p>
          <p>“The Rev. S. S. Jocelyn, of New Haven, Conn.; Arthur Tappan, of New York; Benjamin
Lundy, of Washington, D. C.; William Lloyd Garrison, of Boston, Mass.; Thomas
Shipley and Charles Pierce, of Philadelphia, visited the convention, and were cordially
received.” Messrs. Jocelyn, Tappan and Garrison made stirring addresses and especially
urged the establishment of a college for the education of colored youth. A committee
appointed to consider the matter reported as follows: “The plan proposed is that a college
be established at New Haven, Conn., as soon as $20,000 are obtained
and to be on the manual labor system, by which, in connection with a scientific
education, they may also obtain a useful mechanical or agricultural profession; and
(they further report having received information) that a benevolent individual has
offered to subscribe one thousand dollars toward this object, provided that a farther sum
of nineteen thousand dollars can be obtained in one year.”</p>
          <p>The report of the committee was received and adopted, a soliciting agent and a
treasurer appointed and committees appointed in several cities. You can see that
for a long time the subject of manual training has engaged the attention of thoughtful
people. But the people of Connecticut showed themselves very unfriendly to Negro
schools as we shall presently see, and the idea of the college in that State was given
up. Nearly every year during this period, conventions of colored men were
held and the delegates represented the intelligence, the culture and the learning
of the race in the United States.</p>
          <p>In the town of Canterbury, Conn., a select school for young
<pb id="pendle122" n="122"/>
ladies was established in the summer of 1832 by Miss Prudence
Crandall, a Quaker lady. It was intended to give instruction
in the higher branches of learning. Not long after the school
opened, Sarah Harris, a colored girl seventeen years old, whose
father was a well-to-do farmer applied for admission to the
school. She stated that she had finished the highest grade in
the village schools and wanted to increase her knowledge so as
to teach among her own people.</p>
          <p>Miss Crandall admitted Sarah and for a few days all went well, for many
of the other girls had known Sarah in the village school and liked her. But
after a time some of the parents called on Miss Crandall and objected to a
Negro girl attending a private school with their children, no matter how good
she was nor high and unselfish her aim. But Miss Crandall was firm and
when the white parents withdrew their children she advertised to teach colored girls.</p>
          <p>The angry parents called a town meeting to discuss the matter and a set
of resolutions were drawn up protesting against the founding of a colored school
in their neighborhood. Nevertheless Miss Crandall received into her school in
April, 1833, about twenty young colored girls from Boston, Providence, New York,
Philadelphia; but the storekeepers refused to serve Miss Crandall and her pupils;
the latter met with insult, contempt and abuse in the streets, the well and the doorsteps
of the house were filled with refuse and a number of other petty meannesses were
practiced, but Miss Crandall and the girls remained firm.</p>
          <p>The right-thinking people of the neighborhood came to Miss Crandall's
<sic corr="support">suport</sic>, among them being the Rev. Samuel May, Mr. Arnold Buffom, Mr. George
Benson and others. But a man named Judson, a citizen of Canterbury, and a leading
politician of the State, was bitterly opposed to the school and he so exerted his
influence that a law was passed forbidding the founding of Negro schools anywhere
in the State. This law, which was called a “black law,” reads in part as follows:</p>
          <p>“Be it enacted that no person shall set up or establish in this
<pb id="pendle123" n="123"/>
State any school, academy or other literary institution for the instruction or
education of colored persons, who are not inhabitants of this State, or harbor
or board, for the purpose of attending or being taught in any such school,
academy or literary institution, any colored person who is not an inhabitant
of any town in this State, without the consent in writing, first obtained,
of a majority of the civil authority, and also of the selectmen of the town in
which the school, etc., is situated.” The reason for the law was that the whites
did not wish the colored population to increase and a fine was attached in case
the law was violated. The law was passed May 24, 1833.</p>
          <p>When the news reached Canterbury that the law had passed, the people were wild
with joy, bells were rung, cannon fired as if a great battle had been won, a battle
with a whole state on one side and a little Quaker teacher and twenty children on
the other. Miss Crandall went on with her teaching until the latter part of June, when
she was arrested and after a brief hearing she was committed until the next session
of the Supreme Court of the State, in August.</p>
          <p>Her enemies, knowing that to put her in jail would weaken their cause with good
people, hoped that her friends would not allow her to go to jail; but they hoped
in vain for she was taken to jail and placed in a cell where a <sic corr="murderer">murdered</sic> had been
kept. The news of this outrage spread throughout the north and made many
friends for Miss Crandall and her school. Next day bond was given for Miss
Crandall, but nothing could undo the treatment she had received; she was brought
to trial August 23, 1833, and as the jury could not agree, she was again tried in
October, when the verdict was against her. Her counsel appealed to the Court of
Errors, but the case was finally dropped.</p>
          <p>A short time afterward Miss Crandall's house was set afire,
and though this did not cause her to close the school, when the building was
again attacked by a mob one night in September and the doors and windows broken
in, it was thought best for the pupil's safety to give up the effort. Said Mr. May, who
<pb id="pendle124" n="124"/>
at Miss Crandall's request dismissed the school, “Twenty harmless, well-behaved girls,
whose only offense against the peace of the community was that they had come
together there to obtain useful knowledge and moral culture, were to be told that
they had better go away, because, forsooth, the house in which they dwelt, would
not be protected by the guardians of the town. The words almost blistered my lips.”</p>
          <p>Miss Crandall's school was closed but efforts to educate the Negro were made in other
States, though the laws of the several States differed widely. In some States the
teaching of Negroes was strictly prohibited, among these were Alabama, Georgia,
Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi, Missouri, Indiana, South Carolina, and Virginia.
In other States, while education was not prohibited by law, it was by custom,
while still other States tolerated efforts to enlighten the Negro. Those latter, of course,
were the States where the white people were most enlightened.</p>
          <p>You have read of the splendid work of Benezet in Philadelphia. The first school
for Negroes in New York, was also started by a native of France, Elias Neau,
in 1704. In his home he had embraced the Protestant faith, and being exiled, took up
his abode in New York. His heart was touched by the condition of the Negroes, and,
at first, he taught them by going from house to house after his day's work was done.
Later, he was given permission to have them meet at his home in the evenings
and in 1708, the average attendance was two hundred which shows how his work
was appreciated. Besides reading, writing and arithmetic, he taught his pupils the
truths of the Bible and many became communicants of Trinity P. E. Church, while the
Rev. William Vesey was rector. In spite of many hindrances, Elias Neau continued his
work until 1722, “when amid the unaffected sorrow of his Negro scholars and the
friends who honored him for their sake, he was removed by death.” The school had
several teachers, chiefly assistant rectors of Trinity, who kept the good work
alive, year after year.</p>
          <pb id="pendle125" n="125"/>
          <p>In 1786, a school was opened in Cliff street and in 1791, a woman was engaged
to teach the girls needlework. This school had many trials and in 1815, the schoolhouse
having been burned down, a substantial brick building was erected in William street
and opened for colored pupils. The number of pupils grew so rapidly that, in 1820,
another school was opened on Mulberry street, which accommodated five
hundred children.</p>
          <p>General Lafayette visited this school in 1824, and Master James M. Smith, one of the
pupils, aged eleven years, came forward and made the following speech:</p>
          <p>“General Lafayette: In behalf of myself and fellow-schoolmates may I be permitted
to express our sincere and respectful gratitude to you for the condescension you
have manifested this day in visiting this institution, which is one of the noblest
specimens of New York <sic corr="philanthropy">philanthrophy</sic>. Here, sir, you behold hundreds of the
poor children of Africa sharing with those of a lighter hue in the blessings of
education; and while it will be our pleasure to remember the great deeds you have
done for America, it will be our delight, also, to cherish the memory of
General Lafayette as a friend of African emancipation, and as a member of
this institution.”</p>
          <p>In 1836, Mr. John Peterson, colored, was appointed principal of Colorado Grammar
School No. 1, and Mr. R. F. Wake, also colored, principal of School No. 2. These
gentlemen served with great success and when in 1853, the Board of Education
established a colored normal school, Mr. Peterson was appointed principal of it.</p>
          <p>Some of the educated and cultured colored men of New York were: “Dr. Henry
Highland Barnett, Dr. Charles B. Ray and the Rev. Peter Williams in the pulpit;
Charles L. Reason and William Peterson as teachers; James McCune Smith
and Philip A. White as physicians and chemists; James Williams and Jacob
Day among business men.” Rev. Dr. Alex Crummell was ordained priest in
the Protestant Episcopal Church in 1884. In 1852 he graduated from the
University of Cambridge, England. After fifty years as a minister he retired
<pb id="pendle126" n="126"/>
from active service. Peter Ogden founded the G. U. O. O. F. during this period.</p>
          <p>As you know, the women of our race have from the beginning taken part in
every movement which has sought to uplift, so when the Anti-Slavery
Women of America met in New York in May, 1837, colored women were of
the number. Mary S. Parker was chosen president of the convention, Angelina E.
Grimke, secretary, and Sarah Douglas, a colored woman, was a member of the
central committee. The convention sent out a circular telling of its object and
plans and Sarah Forten, a colored member, composed the poem with which the
circular ended. It reads as follows:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <lg>
              <l>“We are thy sisters. God has truly said</l>
              <l>That of one blood the nations He has made.</l>
              <l>O Christian woman in a Christian land,</l>
              <l>Canst thou unblushing read this great command?</l>
              <l>Suffer the wrongs which wring our inmost heart,</l>
              <l>To draw one throb of pity on thy part?</l>
              <l>Our skins may differ, but from thee we claim</l>
              <l>A sister's privilege and a sister's name.”</l>
            </lg>
          </q>
          <p>In Ohio, the first schools for Negroes were opened in 1820, through the efforts
of colored men of Cincinnati, foremost among whom was Owen T. B. Nickens.
Other schools were opened later and were supported by a white educational society
assisted by Negroes of means, Dennis Hill, William O'Hara, John Woodson, Baker
Jones, John Liverpool and Joseph Fowler being among the latter.</p>
          <p>In 1833, Oberlin College was opened and from the first Negro students were well
received. Some of the earlier graduates were William Howard Day, John Mercer
Langston and George B. Vashon.</p>
          <p>The Cincinnati High School for colored pupils was established in 1844 by a cultured
and wealthy white gentleman, the Rev. Hiram S. Gilmore, and in 1850, public schools
for colored children were opened. On account of some defect in the law,
<pb id="pendle127" n="127"/>
these schools were closed after three months, and the teachers went unpaid.</p>
          <p>A mass meeting of the colored people was called by John I. Gaines, a brave and
intelligent Negro, and the people were urged to take their case to the courts; they
did so and, after an appeal to the Supreme Court, won their case. But there was
dissatisfaction and friction with regard to the management of the schools until 1856,
when the law was altered and the colored people were given the right to elect their
own trustees, by ballot. Two years later, Nicholas Longworth built a schoolhouse
for the use of colored people and leased it to them on condition that they pay for it
in fourteen years.</p>
          <p>One of the pupils of the Cincinnati schools was Moses Dickson. He was born in that
city in 1824, and when he was fourteen years old, his mother died; as his father had
died some years before, he was forced to help support himself. He learned to be a
barber while still going to school and when he was sixteen, he went to work on
a steamboat. For three years he followed this occupation, and as he was a very
observant young man, the condition of his people throughout the slave States
made a great impression on him, and at length he resolved to find a way to help them.</p>
          <p>In the early part of 1844, when only twenty years old, he called together at St. Louis,
eleven other earnest young men and they decided to organize and form a plan to
help the slaves. They knew that a thing of that kind should be arranged thoroughly
and secretly, so they separated to meet again in two years from that time.
Meanwhile each was to travel, hear and see as much as possible, so as to be able
to make wise and helpful suggestions. Free Negroes traveling in this country, at
that time, especially in the slave States, ran many risks. They might be captured
and sold as slaves, if a white person attacked or beat them, they had no redress, and
if they were killed little would be said about it.</p>
          <p>But these young men were brave, fearless and determined. Dickson made a trip
through Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, and
<pb id="pendle128" n="128"/>
other States and on August 12, 1846, the twelve friends met again
in St. Louis. They called themselves the Knights of Liberty, and,
after talking over what they had learned, each one went out as an
organizer to form societies wherever he could. They did not mean to
spring their plan for ten years, but during that time they were to make
the separate bodies as many and as strong as possible. While doing this,
they worked with the Underground Railroad and helped thousands of slaves
to gain freedom.</p>
          <p>When the ten years were over, it could readily be seen that the
state of the public mind was such that all the slaves would soon be free,
and the Knights of Liberty did not attempt to put their plans into action.
A remarkable thing about the organization was that for years no outsider knew
of its existence, nor the names of the twelve founders, and the full
extent of work and final plans of the Knights were never made known.</p>
          <p>After the civil war Dickson, who had been a soldier, and had also
become a licensed preacher of the African Methodist
Episcopal Church, founded a beneficial order in memory of the
Twelve Knights, which he called the Order of Twelve of the Knights
and Daughters of Tabor, “which has for its object the encouragement
of Christianity, education, morality and temperance among the colored
people.” The Order is said to have, at present, more than sixty-five
thousand members.</p>
          <p>In Pennsylvania, the education of Negroes was greatly assisted by the
bequest of Benezet. In 1787, with the aid of five hundred pounds sterling
from Thomas Shirley, a colored man, a schoolhouse was erected. In 1819,
a committee of women Friends, to have charge of the admission and
general superintendence of girls, was added to the board which had charge
of the school.</p>
          <p>Other buildings were erected, and in 1849, statistics showed that “there
was one grammar school, with 463 pupils, two public schools with 339 pupils,
an infant school under charge of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society,
with 70 pupils, a ragged school and a moral-reform school with 81 pupils.
There were
<pb id="pendle129" n="129"/>
about twenty private schools with 300 pupils, making an aggregate of
more than 1,300 children receiving an education.”</p>
          <p>Richard Humphreys, who died in 1832, provided, by his will ten thousand
dollars for the establishment of an Institute for Colored Youth
in Philadelphia, and in 1837, the school was opened. By the terms of
the will, the money was placed in charge of trustees who were to pay it
over to any society that would undertake the work. An association was
formed by thirty Quakers, for the purpose and they stated their ideas as
follows: “We believe that the most successful method of elevating the moral
and intellectual character of the descendants of Africa, as well as of
improving their social condition, is to extend to them the benefits of a
good education, and to instruct them in the knowledge of some useful
trade or business, whereby they may be enabled to obtain a
comfortable livelihood by their industry; and though these means to
prepare them for fulfilling the various duties of domestic and
social life with reputation and fidelity, as good citizens and pious men.”</p>
          <p>In 1839, the trustees purchased a farm in Bristol township and boys
were taught farming, shoemaking, wheelwrighting, blacksmithing, etc.
Several legacies, including one from Jonathan Zane, were added to the
school funds and the work flourished for about seven years, when it
came to a standstill and the farm was sold. In 1852, the work was again
started in the city of Philadelphia, under the management of Charles
L. Reason, a young colored man of New York, who was well educated and
had an especial fitness for this work. A girls' school was started under the same
management, and “many worthy and competent teachers and leaders
of the Negro race came forth from these schools.”</p>
          <p>In 1835 the African Methodist Episcopal Church issued the first copy
of the Christian Recorder. Among the leading colored men of Philadelphia
were William Whipper, Stephen Smith, Robert Purvis, William Still,
Frederick Hinton and Joseph Cassey.</p>
          <pb id="pendle130" n="130"/>
          <p>The three pioneer Negro educators of the District of Columbia knew not
one letter of the alphabet, but, with the respect for knowledge
which characterizes the Negro, they planted that others might reap. George
Bell, Nicholas Franklin and Moses Liverpool were the names of these
lovers of their race, and in 1807, they had built the first schoolhouse
for colored children and hired a teacher. But there were, at that time,
only 494 free Negroes in the city and it was not an easy thing for them
to support a school, so it was closed for a while.</p>
          <p>In 1818, an announcement that the Resolute Beneficial Society would open
“a school for the children of free people of color, and others that
ladies and gentlemen may think proper to be instructed in
reading, writing, arithmetic, English grammar, etc., was published in
the National Intelligencer.” The advertisement was signed by
William Costin, George Hicks, James Harris, George Bell, Archibald
Johnson, Fred Lewis, Isaac Johnson and Scipio Beens.</p>
          <p>A number of schools for colored children were afterward
opened in Washington, by both white and colored people. John
Adams was the first Negro teacher. Others were Mrs. Anne
Maria Hall, John W. Prout, Lindsay Muse, John Brown, Benjamin
McCoy, Charlotte Norris, Sibby McCoy, John F. Cook,
Catherine Costin, George F. T. Cook, Louise Park Costin,
Martha Costin, James Enoch Ambush, Maria Becraft, Mary
Wormley, Nancy Grant, Fanny Hampton, Dr. John N. Fleet,
Charles H. Middleton, Alexander Cornish, Eliza Anne Cook,
Annie Washington, Elizabeth Smith, Isabella Briscoe, Charlotte
Beans, Rev. James Shorter. A large number of pupils
were trained under these teachers, many of whom have proven
an honor to themselves and to the race.</p>
          <p>Primus Hall, an intelligent colored man of Boston, opened in
his home in 1798, the first separate school for Negro children,
and the teacher, Elisha Sylvester, was paid by the parents of
the children. “In 1800, sixty-six colored citizens of Boston
presented a petition to the school committee, praying that a
school might be established for their benefit,” but the town
<pb id="pendle131" n="131"/>
meeting refused to grant it. In 1806 the colored Baptists 
arranged for a school room in the basement of their church in
Belknap street and the school was removed from Mr. Hall's house
to the church.</p>
          <p>Abiel Smith left a sum of money to build a schoolhouse for Negro
children and in 1835 this building, which was called the Smith
schoolhouse, was erected. Interesting exercises marked the opening of
the school and the address of the occasion was made by Hon. William
Minot. The city made an annual appropriation of two hundred dollars
and the parents paid twelve and a half cents per week for each child
who attended. Among those who taught this school was John B.
Russwurm.</p>
          <p>From 1820 to 1855 the colored children of Boston attended
separate public schools, but in the latter year a law was passed
by the Legislature which forbade any distinction being made
between the children “on account of race, color or religious
opinion.”</p>
          <p>John Brown Russwurm, the teacher just mentioned, graduated from
Bowdoin College in Maine in 1826, and was the first of his race in
America to be so honored. It was through the goodness of his
stepmother that he was supported and encouraged, and his career
at college justified her kindness. For a short while he had charge
of Freedom's Journal, an Abolition paper published in New York;
but in 1829 he went to Liberia as superintendent of public schools.
After holding other public positions there he was appointed Governor of
the Maryland colony at Cape Palmas, which place he held until his
death in 1851. Governor Russwurm has been described as follows:</p>
          <p>“He was a man of erect and more than ordinary stature, with
a good head and face and large keen eye. Of sound intellect,
a great reader, with a special fondness for history and politics.
Naturally sagacious in regard to men and things, a man of strict
integrity, a good husband, father and friend, and in later life
a devoted member of the Protestant Episcopal Church.”</p>
          <pb id="pendle132" n="132"/>
          <p>Other prominent Negroes of Boston were “among its clergymen, Leonard
Grimes and John T. Raymond; among its lawyers, Robert Morris and E. G.
Walker; among its business men, J. B. Smith and Coffin Pitts; among
its physicians, John R. Rock and John V. DeGrasse; among its authors,
William W. Brown and William C. Nell; among its orators, Remond
and Hilton.” During this period Alexander Pouskin, the celebrated
Russian writer of prose and poetry, and Alexander Dumas, the
famous French novelist, both of negro descent, came into public notice.</p>
          <p>In Baltimore, the Oblate Sisters of Providence, colored women who were
refugees from San Domingo, opened St. Francis Academy for colored girls in
1829. For about twelve years before that time there had been schools
also supported by the Catholics.</p>
          <p>In 1835, a colored man named William Wells opened a free school for
colored pupils, and upon his death left the sum of seven thousand
dollars for the support of the work. The Wells school rendered good
service to the race and community.</p>
          <p>A distinguished Marylander of this period was Ira Aldridge,
who was born in Belaire, in 1810. When quite a young man
he served as valet for Wallack, the actor and theatrical manager.
In this way he came into contact with the theatrical
world, and felt himself capable of becoming an actor. Edmund
Kean recognized his ability and encouraged him, and Aldridge
went to England where he appeared in several plays. As
Aaron, the Moor, in Titus Adronicus, he created a sensation,
and he was also very successful in his interpretation of Shakespearian
plays, appearing as Othello in Covent Garden in 1833.
At the time of his death in 1867, he was considered the greatest
Othello. Aldridge was highly esteemed and greatly honored
by the crowned heads of Europe, receiving from them many
medals and other decorations. Sir Ira owned nine villas in
different parts of Europe and was said to have been worth
more than $250,000.</p>
          <p>Perhaps the most distinguished son of Maryland was Frederick Douglass,
of who we shall hear in the next chapter.</p>

            <head>FREDERICK DOUGLASS—OTHER NOTABLES.</head>
            <p>THE life of Frederick Douglass reads like a romance, at times almost
tragic in its development. Born on the forsaken Eastern Shore of
Maryland, the exact date of his<figure id="ill14" entity="pendl133"><p>FREDERICK DOUGLASS.</p></figure>
birth unknown to him, born a slave and suffering all which
that condition entailed in the first quarter of the nineteenth
<pb id="pendle134" n="134"/>
century, he lived to gain the respect of the whole enlightened
world and the admiration and friendship of rulers of the earth.</p>
            <p>His mother, having nothing else to bestow upon him, started him off
in life with the resounding cognomen of Frederick Augustus Washington
Bailey. This name his companions soon shortened to “Gus Bailey,” and by
the latter title he was known for some years. While still very young,
he was separated from his mother, and his earliest recollections of her
were that she would often steal from the plantation where she worked,
miles away, and would come to see him in the middle of the night.</p>
            <p>Long after the Civil War, Mr. Douglass once told the following story
of his life to the pupils of a colored school in Talbot County, Maryland,
the county in which he was born: “I once knew a little colored boy whose
father and mother died when he was six years old. He was a slave and had
no one to care for him. He slept on a dirt floor in a hovel and in
cold weather would crawl into a meal bag, headforemost, and leave his
feet in the ashes to keep them warm. Often he would roast an ear of
corn and eat it to satisfy his hunger, and many times has he crawled
under the barn or stable. and secured eggs, which he would roast in the
fire and eat.</p>
            <p>“This boy did not wear pants like you do, but a tow linen shirt.
Schools were unknown to him, and he learned to spell from an old
Webster's spelling book, and to read and write from posters on cellars
and barn doors, while boys and men would help him. He would then preach
and speak, and soon became well known. He finally held several high
positions and accumulated some wealth. He wore broadcloath and did
not have to divide crumbs with the dogs under the table. That boy was
Frederick Douglass.</p>
            <p>“What was possible for me is possible for you. Do not think because
you are colored you cannot accomplish anything. Strive earnestly
to add to your knowledge. So long as you remain in ignorance, so
long will you fail to command the respect of your fellow men.”</p>
            <pb id="pendle135" n="135"/>
            <p>At an early age Frederick Douglass was taken to Baltimore
where he lived with members of the Auld family, his <sic corr="owners. When">owners,
When</sic> about sixteen years old, he was sent to work with other
slaves on the farm of Edward Covey, and it was here that he
made his first resistance against the system of slavery by overpowering
an overseer who attempted to whip him. The attempt was not made
again. After an unsuccessful attempt to
escape in 1836, he was caught and sent to Baltimore. But his
mind was made up to flee from slavery and after a while he
escaped to New York and later to New Bedford, Mass. By
this time he had learned to read and write, and above all, <hi rend="italics">to
think</hi>. In New Bedford he changed his name to Frederick
Douglass and here also he was wed to Miss Anna Murray, a
free woman, who bore him several children.</p>
            <p>In 1839, Edwin Thompson, a noted Abolitionist, traveled through
Massachusetts making speeches in the anti-slavery cause. Mr.
Douglass was present at one of these meetings held in New Bedford,
and some years afterward said that it was Thompson who waked him up
on the subject and by quoting some of Whittier's poems, inspired him
and made him feel, indeed, a new man. In 1841, Mr. Douglass was, after
much begging and persuading, induced to relate to the congregation of
the Rev. Thomas James—himself an ex-slave—the story of his
experiences in slavery.</p>
            <p>This was his first public talk, and though his audience was small and
humble, it is said that he was very nervous and ill at ease. This man
who was destined to stir the world by his oratory, was at first
overcome by timidity at the thought of addressing an audience of
his own people. But once started and brought to realize his possession
of the divine gift, he went on from triumph to triumph.</p>
            <p>Like water seeking its level, he made one acquaintance after another among
the enlightened, broadminded, cultured people of Massachusetts;
for people of that caliber were the only ones who were capable of
appreciating him. He consorted
<pb id="pendle136" n="136"/>
with the noble company who were working for the overthrow of
slavery—Wendell Phillips, William Lloyd Garrison, Owen Lovejoy
and many others; and since he realized that the love of freedom is not
bounded by sex, he threw his support also to the cause of equal
suffrage, and was the friend of such noble women as Elizabeth Cady
Stanton, Lucretia Mott, Sojourner Truth, the Grimke sisters, Susan B.
Anthony and a host of others.</p>
            <p>It is interesting to note that about this time, the “Jim Crow” car law
was in full force in Massachusetts and colored persons were forced to
travel in a rough car with hard seats, much as in the case in the
Southern States today. Those who protested against this and entered
other cars, were thrown off bodily. It is related that Mr. Douglass
was frequently thrown from the cars and that on one occasion in Lynn,
four seats were broken in trying to get him out, as he would not help
himself out. And this reminds me of an incident told of Mr. Douglass
and the Jim Crow cars of the South.</p>
            <p>It is said that on a certain occasion, he had an engagement to lecture
in a southern city and toward the end of his journey was compelled
to use the section reserved for colored people, which in this case was an
end of a freight car. This, it will easily be understood, was
particularly obnoxious and when the delegation which went to meet him saw
him in such surroundings they began to apologize that coming to them
had caused him to be so humiliated and degraded. Drawing himself
up to his full height, the grand old mail replied, “Gentlemen,
by ignoble actions I may degrade myself, but <hi rend="italics">nothing and no man can
degrade Frederick Douglass.”</hi> Those words should never be forgotten,
for the lesson they teach is worthy of imitation by all. Be master
of your soul, do nothing that is ignoble and whenever an attempt is
made to <sic corr="embarrass">embarass</sic> or humiliate you, you will be able to treat it with
the contempt which it deserves.</p>
            <p>In 1845 Mr. Douglass went to Europe to lecture on slavery; on the
trip over he was not allowed a first cabin berth. As the ship
neared her journey's end, the captain gave to the first
<pb id="pendle137" n="137"/>
cabin passengers a complimentary dinner, after which some of the
passengers knowing of Douglass' presence on board, desired to hear
him speak. As soon as he began a great uproar was started by those
who at heart were slaveholders, and there were loud cries
of “Kill him,” “Throw him overboard,” and for a time he was in great
danger. The captain, however, took his part, and invited those who
did not wish to hear Douglass to leave the dining saloon, threatening
that if the speaker was again interrupted, every one of the disturbers
should be put in irons. Douglass then went on and delivered one of
his most telling speeches.</p>
            <p>Upon his arrival in England his lectures upon slavery were delivered
to large audiences and won for himself and for his causes many friends.
A purse of $750 was made up by his English friends to purchase his liberty,
and he returned to this country a free man.</p>
            <p>In 1847 he began the publication of a newspaper, “The North Star,” in
Rochester, N. Y., and the paper was widely read by lovers of liberty.
While living in Rochester, his little daughter, Rosetta, applied for
admission to the public schools, but was denied admission on account
of color. Mr. Douglass at once began to fight the silly prejudice and
did not rest until “every door of the public schools of Rochester not
only swung wide open to the admission of his own children, but to
every child of every race.”</p>
            <p>Mr. Douglass had become an intimate friend of John Brown and in 1859
a despatch was sent to the sheriff of Philadelphia, where Mr. Douglass
was at the time, to arrest him for complicity in the John Brown raid.
The telegraph operator, being a friend of Douglass, held up the despatch
and left his office in search of Douglass' friends, advising them to
hurry the latter out of the country. This they did, and the despatch
was not delivered until Douglass was well on the way to Rochester.
He reached home in safety, went over into Canada, thence to Europe where
he remained until danger was over.</p>
            <pb id="pendle138" n="138"/>
            <p>At the beginning of the Civil War, he returned to this country and
helped persuade President Lincoln to arm the Negroes; the colored
regiments of Massachusetts were raised with his active assistance,
his sons becoming members of the famous 54th Massachusetts Volunteers.</p>
            <p>Besides his splendid work in other directions, Mr. Douglass held several
public positions of honor and trust. In 1871, he was appointed
assistant secretary to the Commission to San Domingo; upon finishing
that task, he was appointed a member of the Upper House of the
Territorial Legislature of the District of Columbia, which he had
previously chosen for his permanent home. In 1872 he was presidential
elector-at-large for the state of New York; he was successively appointed
United States Marshal for the District of Columbia, Recorder of Deeds
for the same place, and U. S. Minister to Haiti. The sympathy and
insight which he showed for the people of that Republic endeared
him to them and his memory is held in greatest reverence by all
patriotic Haitians. Mr. Douglass was married in 1884 to Miss Helen
Pitts.</p>
            <p>Mr. Douglass died at his home, Cedar Hill, Anacostia, D. C., February
20th, 1895, at the age of seventy-eight. An immense throng attended the
funeral services and many glowing tributes were paid to his worth.
Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton sent a letter which was read by Miss
Susan B. Anthony. The following is an extract: “I saw Mr. Douglass
first before a Boston audience, when he was fresh from the land of
bondage. He stood there like an African prince, conscious of his
dignity and power, grand in his physical proportions, majestic in
his wrath, as with keen wit, satire and indignation he portrayed the
bitterness of slavery, the humiliation of having been subject to
those who in all human virtues and capabilities were inferior to
himself. His denunciation of our national crime, of the wild and
guilty fantasy that men could hold property in man—poured like
a torrent that fairly made his hearers tremble.”</p>
            <pb id="pendle139" n="139"/>
            <p>“Thus I first saw him and wondered as I listened, that any
mortal man should have ever tried to subjugate a being with
such marvellous powers, such self respect, such intense love of
liberty. Around him sat the great anti-slavery orators of the
day, watching his effect on that immense audience, completely
magnetized with his eloquence; laughing and crying by turns
with his rapid flights from pathos to humor. All other speakers
seemed tame after Douglass. Sitting near I heard Wendell
Phillips say to Lydia Maria Child, ‘Verily, this boy, who has
only just graduated from slavery, throws us all in the shade.’
‘Ah,’ she replied, ‘the iron has entered his soul and he knows
the wrongs of slavery subjectively; the rest of you speak only
from an objective point of view.’ ”</p>

            <head>SOJOURNER TRUTH.</head>
            <p>One of the colored women who came into prominence during the first half
of the nineteenth century was Isabella Ardinburg, born a slave in New York.
By the Gradual Emancipation Act, she was entitled to her freedom in 1828,
but as often happened in these days, she was twice sold in spite of
the act. Isabella settled the matter by running away. She gave herself
the singular name of Sojourner Truth, claiming that God had commissioned
her to be a traveler or sojourner and that as she went from place to place
she was to preach and teach the truth.</p>
            <p>She could neither read nor write, but having a splendid memory,
all that was read in her hearing became a part of her, and
as she was remarkably intelligent she made the most of all she
received. It is said that she could quote passage after passage
of Scripture and could aptly apply it to the affairs of everyday
life. She was active in all good works, and was a forceful
and magnetic speaker having the happy faculty of expressing
a powerful thought in a few words. She was in great demand
at Woman Suffrage and Anti-Slavery meetings.</p>
            <p>Her unwavering trust in God made her a power among the people, in spite
of her ignorance of books, and during the Civil
<pb id="pendle140" n="140"/>
War she gave great assistance to the soldiers. After the war, she
formed the idea that the freedmen would be much better off as colonists
in the West, and while on her travels obtained many signatures to
a petition to Congress asking that body to take some
steps in the matter. Congress failed to act, but
Sojourner persuaded a large number of individuals to follow
her suggestion.</p>
            <p>Some years before the war she was present at a meeting in Rochester
when Frederick Douglass, saddened and discouraged by the operation of the
Fugitive Slave law, was making a very gloomy speech. Suddenly Sojourner
arose and said, “Frederick, is God dead?” The effect of her question was
magical, and Douglass immediately began to speak in a more hopeful tone,
finally making one of the best speeches of his life. “A short time before her
death in 1883, she claimed to be more than one hundred years old;
but at that time she seemed to be renewing her youth, as some of the
failing senses grew strong again, and her power as a speaker was not
abated.” Because of her wisdom and the pointed brevity with which she
expressed herself, Sojourner Truth was called the Libyan Sibyl.</p>

            <head>HARRIET TUBMAN.</head>
            <p>Harriet Tubman, born Arminta Ross, who still lives (February,
1912), is another strong character who became famous
during this period. She was married in 1844 to a free Negro
named John Tubman. She was a slave in Maryland, but decided
that she would not remain in that condition. Having
made her escape to freedom, she was not satisfied, but determined
to rescue her parents and as many of her former companions as she
could by making personal visits to her old home.</p>
            <p>“Her success was wonderful. Time and again she would visit Maryland
and be absent for weeks, running daily risks while making preparations
for herself and her passengers on the Underground Railroad. Great fears were
entertained for her safety, but she seemed wholly devoid of personal fear. The
<pb id="pendle141" n="141"/>
idea of being captured by slave hunters or slaveholders, seemed never to
enter her mind. Half of her time she had the appearance of one asleep, and
would actually sit down by the roadside and go fast asleep when on her
errands of mercy through the South, yet she would not suffer one of her
party to whimper once, however wearied they might be from hard travel day
and night.” A reward of $40,000 was offered for her capture but she laughed
when it was read to her by one whom she was helping to escape.</p>
            <p>Harriet had a very short and pointed rule of her own, which implied death
to any who talked of giving out and going back. Of course Harriet was
supreme, her followers called her “Moses” and had full faith in her;
so when she said to them that “a live runaway could do great harm by going
back, but that a dead one could tell no secrets,” she was sure to
have obedience. It is obvious, however, that her success in going into
Maryland as she did, was attributable to her adventurous spirit
and utter disregard of consequences.
Her like, it is probable, was never known before or since.</p>
            <p>It is said that on one occasion, while walking down the road
near her old home, she met her ex-master face to face. Her
presence of mind did not fall her, but drawing her sunbonnet
well over her face, she caused a bunch of chickens which she
was carrying, to keep up such a flutter that the man passed her
by without dreaming of who she was.</p>
            <p>At one time, up in the state of New York, a colored man was being
sought by slave catchers, under the fugitive slave law. Harriet Tubman
came up just as they were taking the man to be locked up. She at once took
command of the crowd of sympathetic bystanders and by her great courage,
nimble wit and physical strength caused the man to be rescued.</p>
            <p>Like Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman did not allow her interest in her
race to end with slavery, but in many ways busied herself in their behalf.
At Auburn., N. Y., she founded a home for the homeless and while her
strength lasted she
<pb id="pendle142" n="142"/>
ministered to the necessities of those within her gates. At
first the Harriet Tubman home consisted of a brick house and
seven acres of land; at present there are two other houses and
a total of twenty-six acres of ground. Aunt Harriet, who is
said to be nearly one hundred years old, is a tenderly cared for
inmate of the home and receives a small pension from the government
as well as help from her own people, the Empire State
Federation of Women's Clubs contributing a generous share.
Harriet was personally acquainted with John Brown who introduced
her to Wendell Phillips as “General Tubman, one of
the bravest and best persons on the continent.” During the
Civil War she acted as nurse, spy and scout in the Union Army.</p>

            <head>FRANCES ELLEN WATKINS HARPER.</head>
            <p>In contrast to the two women just mentioned, Frances Ellen
Watkins was born free and had in her youth some advantages
of education. She was born in Baltimore in 1825, and having
lost her parents when very young, she was reared by an aunt.
Her uncle, William Watkins, taught a private school, and to
this school Frances went until she was thirteen years old. She
then went to work for a lady who owned quite a library and
who took quite an interest in Frances and allowed her to read
any book in the library during her spare time, ‘except a novel.”</p>
            <p>Frances preferred reading to <sic corr="anything">anthing</sic> else and eagerly took
advantage of her opportunities. She soon began to make
rhymes and before she was twenty-one, she had written a number
of pieces, both prose and poems. In 1846, they were published
in a little book called “Forest Leaves.” One of the
poems, called <sic corr="Ethiopia">Ethopia</sic>, was printed at the time in an English
journal. It read as follows:</p>
            <pb id="pendle143" n="143"/>

            <p>Leaving Baltimore in 1851, Miss Watkins resided first in
Ohio and then in Pennsylvania, teaching school in both states.
But the sight of a man who had been captured and brutally
treated under the Fugitive Slave Law caused her to feel that
she could do more good as a lecturer in the Anti-Slavery cause,
and in 1854 she began that work in New Bedford. Her first
lecture was called the Education and the Elevation of the Colored
Race. Her engagement lasted for about eighteen months
and during that time, she spoke in nearly all of the New England
states, addressing her audiences upon various phases of
the subject so dear to her heart.</p>
            <p>She then visited the flourishing colony of Negroes in Upper
Canada. She became a warm friend of Mrs. John Brown and
spent two weeks at the home of the latter during the sad time
that the Hero of Harpers Ferry was waiting to be executed.
In 1860 Miss Watkins was married to Mr. Fenton Harper of
Ohio, but household duties did not entirely prevent her keeping
up her literary work and following the course of public
events. After a happy married life her husband died in 1864.</p>
            <p>Upon the issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation, Mrs.
Harper was invited to address a public meeting in Columbus,
and from that time on was almost constantly engaged in writing,
lecturing or ministering in other ways to the needs of our
people. Throughout the southern states she went, carrying a
loving heart, a cultivated mind and an unconquerable soul. She
plead the cause of temperance, industry, thrift and equal opportunity.
Many times she was advised to abandon a lecture,
as to give it might be dangerous, but she never took such advice.
As a temperance lecturer she was said to be unsurpassed.</p>
            <p>A southern white man who once heard her, described her as
follows: “Her voice was remarkable—as sweet as any woman's
voice we ever heard, and so clear and distinct as to pass every
syllable to the most distant ear in the house. The speaker left
the impression on our mind that she was not only intelligent
and educated, but, the great end of education, she was enlightened.
She comprehends perfectly the situation of her people,
<pb id="pendle145" n="145"/>
to whose interests she seems ardently devoted.” “Get land,”
she said, “every one that can, and as fast as you can. A landless
people must be dependent upon the landed people. A few
acres to till for food and a roof, however humble, over your
head, are the castles of your independence.”</p>
            <p>Mrs. Harper died in Philadelphia in 1911, full of years and
honors. Her own words, written in 1871, seem her most fitting
epitaph: ‘But after all, what matters it when I am in my grave,
whether I have been rich or poor, loved or hated, despised
or respected, if Christ will only own me to His Father,
and I be permitted to a place in one of His mansions of rest.”</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
          <head>AN EVENTFUL DECADE.</head>
          <p>The years from 1850 to 1860 were to the Negro full of interesting
and important events, In 1850 the Fugitive Slave
Law was passed, which allowed owners to hunt for and
claim their runaway slaves in any part of the Union. By this time<figure id="ill15" entity="pendl146"><p>JOHN BROWN AT HARPER'S FERRY</p></figure>
there were hundreds of fugitives who had found freedom and
made homes for themselves in the northern and western States
and this law carried terror to their souls. As many as could
do so fled to Canada, but numbers of those who had for years
enjoyed the blessings of liberty were claimed and dragged back
into slavery. This law became a broad cover, under which the
<pb id="pendle147" n="147"/>
kidnapping of free persons of color was extensively carried on,
and scores of men, women and children, born free were
dragged from their homes and consigned to hopeless bondage.</p>
          <p>On some occasions pitched battles were fought between
the fugitives and their owners, “every man was compelled to
become a slave hunter, under certain conditions, and every
kind-hearted woman who might give a cup of cold water or
the shelter of a roof to a suffering sister fleeing from intolerable
bondage, incurred the penalty of a felony.”</p>
          <p>But though the operation of the Fugitive Slave Law darkened
this whole decade, there was here and there a gleam of
light amid the darkness. In 1851, Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe
began to publish, in serial form, in the National Era, of Washington,
D. C., her epoch-marking story of Uncle Tom's Cabin.
From the beginning the story aroused the most intense interest,
and when it was published in book form, it was translated into
nearly every known language. The little author became famous
and thousands of friends were made for the slave through this
book. It hastened emancipation.</p>
          <p>Colored authors of the period were Rev. Daniel Payne, Martin R. Delaney,
Frederick Douglass, Rev. Samuel Ringgold
Ward, William C. Nell, Rev. Austin Stewart, Dr. William
Wells Brown.</p>
          <p>About this time, the Negro began to take his place in the
musical world and again a woman led the way. Elizabeth
Taylor was born in Natchez, Miss., in 1809, and was taken to
Philadelphia by Mrs. Greenfield, a Quaker lady. After a time
it was discovered that Elizabeth had a beautiful voice and a
kind young lady, a friend of Mrs. Greenfield's gave her vocal
and instrumental lessons. Elizabeth, who added Mrs. Greenfield's
name to her own, gained quite a name as a singer, and
in 1851 accepted an invitation to sing before the Musical Association
of Buffalo. Her voice was described by musical critics
of the time, as being “full, round, of immense compass and
depth and remarkable sweetness; her pronunciation very correct
and her intonation excellent. She plays with ability upon
<pb id="pendle148" n="148"/>
the piano, harp and guitar.” In compliment, she was called the
Black Swan.</p>
          <p>“After singing in nearly all the free States she resolved to
carry out her long-entertained purpose of visiting Europe in
order to perfect herself in the technique of her art.” Arrived
in London, May, 1853, she called upon Harriet Beecher Stowe,
who was also in the city at the time. Through Mrs. Stowe
Miss Greenfield was introduced into the most exclusive English
circles, and on one occasion she sang before the Queen. Her
beautiful voice and modest, dignified bearing gained many
friends for her as well as for the race. Upon her return to
America, her voice showed remarkable improvement, due to
the additional training which she had received, and until her
death in 1876, she devoted herself to her art.</p>
          <p>Thomas J. Bowers, of Philadelphia, styled “the colored
Mario,” and his sister, Sarah Sedgwick Bowers, were famous
musicians of this period, the former appearing with the Black
Swan, in 1851. Justin Holland, of Norfolk county, Va., performer
on the piano, guitar and flute; Henry Williams, of
Boston, composer and bandmaster; the Lucca family of Connecticut,
all became famous during this decade. The Luccas
toured for a while with the famous Hutchinson family, a group
of white musicians.</p>
          <p>In 1854 Dred Scott, a Negro, sued for his freedom because of
having been taken by his master from Missouri to Minnesota,
which latter State had been made free territory by the Missouri
Compromise. The case being decided for Scott was
appealed to the Supreme Court in 1856, and Judge Taney, a
Maryland slaveholder, there rendered his infamous decision
to the effect that Negroes “were beings of an inferior order
and altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in
social or political relations; and so far inferior that they had
no rights which the white man was bound to respect.” The
effect of this decision upon the Negroes and their white friends
may better be imagined than described. It was a milestone
toward the inevitable end.</p>
          <pb id="pendle149" n="149"/>
          <p>Efforts were still being made to educate the Negro. Abolitionists
were still trying to free him, and he was still trying
to help himself. Negro churches were endeavoring, as they
had from their organization, to serve as levers for moral and
spiritual uplift.</p>
          <p>The Rev. Charles Avery, of New York, left at his death, a
large sum for the benefit of the race in Africa and America.
He also left $25,000 as an endowment fund for the college
which he had founded in, Allegheny City and which bears his
name. In 1856, what was then called Ashmun Institute, but is
now known as Lincoln University, was formally dedicated.
It is situated in Chester county, Pa., and was founded for the
“scientific, classical and theological education of colored youth
of the male sex.”</p>
          <p>In the summer of 1856 the Cincinnati Conference of the
Methodist Episcopal Church decided to establish a university
for the education of colored youth. Its board of trustees consisted
of twenty-four members, four of whom were colored.
The latter were Bishop D. A. Payne, Rev. Lewis Woodson,
Mr. Alfred Anderson, and Mr. Ishmael Keith. The school was
dedicated in October, 1856, and remained open until 1862.
Colored Methodists bought the land and buildings in 1863 for
$10,000, and the growth of the institution under their management
is a credit to their church and their race.</p>
          <p>Charles Sumner, the learned and distinguished senator from
Massachusetts and the unfailing friend and defender of the
slave, was on May 22, 1856, struck down and beaten with a
cane while sitting at his desk in the Senate room. His assailant
was a member from South Carolina, who had taken offence
at a speech made by Senator Sumner. It is said the latter
never fully recovered from the effects of the assault; he died
in Washington in 1874.</p>
          <p>A colored woman, having been put off a street car in New
York on account of her color, employed Hon. Chester A.
Arthur as lawyer and entered suit against the company. She
<pb id="pendle150" n="150"/>
won her suit, and by the decision then given, no discrimination
in public conveyances was afterward allowed in the State.</p>
          <p>The members of the Underground Railroad were especially
active during this decade in defiance of the Fugitive Slave
Law. Besides those already named the following took earnest
interest in this work: Charles Wise, Edwin Coates, Esther
Moore, Abigail Goodwin, Daniel Gibbons, Lucretia Mott,
Thomas Garrett, James Mott, J. Miller McKim, Rev. William
Furness, William Wright, Elijah Pennypacker, Dr. Bartholemew
Fussell, John Hunn, Samuel Rhoades, Grace Anne,
Miriann and Elizabeth Lewis, John Needles, Thomas Shipley
and others. Prominent among the colored members were:
William Still, for many years secretary of the Philadelphia
Vigilance Committee, and author of a book containing the
records of the Underground Railroad; N. W. Depee, Jacob
White, Robert Purvis, William Whipper, Samuel Burris
Frances, E. W. Harper and many others.</p>
          <p>Another true friend was Miss Myrtilla Miner, who was born
in Brookfield, Madison county, N. Y., March 4, 1815. In
person she was very frail and spent several of her early years
as an invalid, but her strong and <sic corr="beautiful">beautifuul</sic> spirit upheld her
and enabled her to acquire, after many difficulties, a sound
education. It was this spirit which helped her to accomplish
what later became a master passion—the founding of a school
for the education of colored youth.</p>
          <p>As governess to the children of a Mississippi planter, she
came to understand the horrors of slavery and its blighting
effect upon both races. She saw, too, the pitiable condition of
free colored people and realized that to educate them was to
do them the greatest kindness. Accordingly, though friends
advised against it she determined to establish in the District
of Columbia a school for free colored girls.</p>
          <p>When in Rochester, visiting friends, she went to see Frederick
Douglass and told him of her plan. He did all he could
to prevent the attempt, as she seemed so fragile and he knew
full well what she would have to undergo in such a cause. But
<pb id="pendle151" n="151"/>
nothing could deter Miss Miner and she came to Washington
and opened her school with six pupils, in the home of Edward
C. Younger, a colored man, who lived on Eleventh street near
New York avenue.</p>
          <p>There were in Washington at that time, about ten thousand
colored free people and about three thousand six hundred
slaves. The number of Miss Miner's pupils rapidly increased
and she was compelled to remove several times. Finally, after
many struggles and trials, she bought in 1852 with the help of
friends, a lot containing three acres, bounded by New Hampshire
avenue and N street and Nineteenth and Twentieth
streets. There were two small frame houses on the lot, the
whole costing forty-three hundred dollars. Mrs. Harriet
Beecher Stowe gave toward its purchase one thousand dollars
of the money she received from Uncle Tom's Cabin, and other
friends gave largely. But Miss Miner was not allowed to teach
her school in peace. Rowdies gave her constant annoyance,
often gathering as the girls passed out to go home, and insulting
and terrifying them. Once her house was set on fire, but a
passerby awoke her and helped to put it out. Stones were
frequently thrown at her windows in the night time and she
was otherwise annoyed. At one time in answer to threats of
violence she fearlessly and indignantly exclaimed, “Mob my
school! You dare not! If you tear it down over my head,
I shall get another house. There is no law to prevent my
teaching these people, and I shall teach them, even unto death.”
So brave and so magnificent was the soul within that frail
body.</p>
          <p>In 1857, the Mayor of Washington began to oppose Miss
Miner's work and for a time it seemed that the school would
be closed, but that danger passed. In 1863, by act of Congress
the Institute for the Education of Colored Youth in the District
of Columbia was incorporated with the following as trustees:
Henry Addison, J. C. Underwood, G. J. Abbott, W. H.
Channing, Nancy M. Johnson and Myrtilla Miner. The first
<pb id="pendle152" n="152"/>
lot purchased was sold for nearly ten times its cost, and another
lot bought at Seventeenth and Church streets.</p>
          <p>In May, 1864, while in California for the benefit of her
health, Miss Miner met with an accident from which she never
recovered. She returned to Washington and died December
17, 1864. The Miner Building, used for years for pupils of
the colored normal school of Washington and another large
building are maintained by the Miner Board.</p>
          <p>When we remember the trials and sacrifices of Miss Miner,
Miss Crandall and a host of others, it does seem that not a
colored child in the whole country should be tardy or absent
from school without grave cause and that no colored child
should ever play truant.</p>
          <p>You have heard that the Fugitive Slave Law did much to
arouse pity and sympathy for the Negroes and added to the
number of their friends and well-wishers. But all the people
of the northern and western States were not <sic corr="friends">frinds</sic> of the
slave. There were many who valued nothing but money and
who resented the agitation which slavery was creating because
it was “hurtful to business.” It was this latter class who
assisted in the Boston riot of 1835, when William Lloyd Garrison
was dragged through the streets with a halter around his
neck. A sort of fury seemed to lay hold upon them and they
were glad to help catch slaves.</p>
          <p>When the people of the south heard of such actions they felt
encouraged and began to talk of seceding from the Union and
forming an independent government of which slavery was to
be the keystone—though of the latter plan they did not speak
openly. The question of whether or not the Union should be
preserved with slavery or without it was being discussed from
every angle in Congress and out of it and the southerners
claimed that the Missouri Compromise had taken all power
from the south and that the anti-slavery agitation would compel
them to withdraw from the Union—but that was only an
excuse.</p>
          <pb id="pendle153" n="153"/>
          <p>In 1854 a bill to repeal the Missouri Compromise was introduced,
and in the debate which followed, Senator Salmon P.
Chase said: “Now, sir, who is responsible for this renewal of
strife and controversy? It is slavery that renews the strife. It
is slavery that again wants room. It is slavery with its insatiate
demand for more slave territory and more slave States.” But
the bill was practically passed when Kansas and Nebraska were
admitted into the Union with the understanding that the
dwellers in those States should decide whether their land
should be slave or free.</p>
          <p>Since the whole eastern border of Kansas adjoined the slave-trade
State of Missouri there followed years of struggle, fighting,
murder, election frauds, etc., for the pro-slavery and the
anti-slavery people were each <sic corr="determined">determind</sic> to win. During this
time the State was called Bleeding Kansas. And on the scene,
brave, fearless and uncompromising, appeared John Brown,
the Man of the Hour.</p>
          <p>John Brown was of the fourth generation from Peter Brown,
who landed at Plymouth, Mass., December 22, 1620, from the
Mayflower. The former was born in the first year of the nineteenth
century (May 9, 1800), at Torrington, Conn. He was
of a stern and upright character, little given to talking, but
when he did speak, it was with purpose and power. For many
years he had been thinking deeply upon a plan to free all the
slaves, and had decided that the best way would be to arm
them and lead them into battle against their masters.</p>
          <p>Perhaps he felt that the plans of Gabriel, Vesey and Turner
might be enlarged and improved upon. At any rate he kept
his designs to himself and very few of his most intimate friends
had the slightest idea of what he was thinking. It is said,
however, that he took his sons into his confidence, and they
pledged themselves to help him in a cause which they all felt
to be a high and holy one.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, when the struggle began in Kansas (some of his
sons were living there) Brown appeared at a meeting at Ossowatomie,
where he made a speech, which threw the convention
<pb id="pendle154" n="154"/>
into consternation. He said that slavery had been the curse
of all ages, that slaves were men and that some active steps
should be taken to help them. “Talk,” he said, “is a national
institution, but it does no good to the slave.” He continued
his speech at some length and so great was the impression he
made that he was often referred to as “John Brown, of Ossawatomie.”</p>
          <p>He joined his sons at their home and in 1856 helped them
to gain a victory over the pro-slavery forces on the Kansas
prairie. In 1858 he began to unfold his plans to a chosen few,
and in May called a secret convention in Chatham Canada
West, to which were invited the white and colored friends of
freedom. The convention adopted a “Provisional Constitution
and Ordinances.” In June he returned to Kansas whence
in December he went over into Missouri and rescued some
slaves who were about to be sold, conveying them, after many
perils to Canada.</p>
          <p>About a year before this John Brown went to Boston, where
he made many personal friends and received large contributions
for the defence of Kansas. But as the terrors of slavery
increased, Brown, then in his sixtieth year, resolved to strike
a blow against the system. Gathering a handful of followers
in the summer of 1859 he secretly prepared for action by hiring
a farm a few miles from Harpers Ferry, where he stored as
many weapons of various kinds as he could gather.</p>
          <p>“On Sunday, October 16, 1859, under cover of profound
darkness, Brown, at the head of seventeen white men and five
Negroes, entered Harpers Ferry, put out the lights, seized the
armory and the railroad bridge and quietly arrested and
imprisoned in the government buildings the citizens found
here and there in the streets, each one of whom was ignorant
of what had happened. By eight o'clock Monday morning
Brown and his few followers among whom were two of his
sons, had full possession of the village and government works.
When asked what was his purpose and by what authority he
acted Brown replied: ‘To free the slaves and by the authority
of God Almighty.’ ”</p>
          <pb id="pendle155" n="155"/>
          <p>He felt assured that when the blow had been struck the
Negroes of the surrounding country would rise and flock to his
standard. He sincerely believed that a general uprising of the
slaves of the whole country would follow. But the slaves
knew nothing of his plans, his character, nor his past deeds and
so they knew not whether he was a real friend or was only
trying to entrap them.</p>
          <p>When the Virginia militia, arriving Monday night, attacked
the little band it was driven to a last stand in the fire-engine
house, and here Brown defended himself with great bravery.
With one son dead by his side and another shot through
he felt the pulse of his dying child with one hand, held his rifle
with the other, and issued commands to his men with all the
composure of a general in his marquee, telling them to be firm
and to sell their lives as dearly as possible.”</p>
          <p>The militia was reinforced by Col. Robert E. Lee, with two
pieces of artillery and ninety United States marines. The
soldiers broke open the doors of the engine house and captured
the insurgents, and the survivors were hurried off to prison.
Brown was quickly tried and indicted for murder and treason;
being found guilty, he was hanged December 3, 1859, at
Charlestown, just a short distance from Harper's Ferry.</p>
          <p>In a letter written to a Boston friend in November he said:
“I am quite cheerful and never more happy. Have only time
to write you a word. May God forever reward you and all
yours. My love to all who love their neighbors. I have asked
to be spared from having any mock or hypocritical prayers
made over me when I am publicly murdered; and that my only
religious attendants be poor little, dirty, ragged, bareheaded,
barefooted, slave boys and girls, led by some old gray-headed
slave mother. Farewell. Farewell.”</p>
          <p>His wish was granted for a negro mother brought her child,
and he kissed it as he passed on his way to the gallows. The
news of John Brown's raid spread terror to slave owners, and
they imagined that there were conspirators scattered over all
the country, but a strict investigation showed that only about
<pb id="pendle156" n="156"/>
twenty-five knew the details of his plan and most of them were
dead or imprisoned at the time of investigation.</p>
          <p>In the little burial ground at Oberlin, Lorain County, Ohio,
there is a monument dedicated to the memory of three of John
Brown's men as follows:</p>
          <p>L. S. Leary, died at Harpers Ferry, October 20, 1859, aged
twenty-four years.</p>
          <p>S. Green, died at Charlestown, Va., December 2, 1859, aged
twenty-eight years.</p>
          <p>J. A. Copeland, died at Charlestown, Va., Dec. 2, 1859, aged
twenty-five years.</p>
          <p>These colored citizens of Oberlin, the heroic associates of
the immortal John Brown, gave their lives for the slave.</p>
          <p>Though John Brown's raid seemed to be a failure the spirit
which moved him spread through the land and roused to word-conflicts,
fiercer than ever, the friends and foes of slavery.
“The Union must be dissolved,” cried some. “Save the Union
at all costs,” cried others. And over all the dark clouds of
civil war—a war in which brother should fight against brother
and father against son—lowered on the horizon.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
          <head>THE NEGRO IN THE CIVIL WAR.</head>
          <p>THE number of slaves in this country in 1860 was 3,950 531,
and of free Negroes there were 251,000. In December
of that year, the people of South Carolina through
representatives assembled at Charleston, adopted articles of
secession and declared South Carolina an independent State,<figure id="ill16" entity="pendl157"><p>BATTLE OF FORT WAGNER.</p></figure>
calling upon other southern States to follow their lead and
assist in forming a Confederacy. Six States soon responded
in the following order: Mississippi, January 9; Florida, January
10; Alabama, January 11; Georgia, January 19; Louisiana,
January 26; Texas, February 1. The ferment of secession
was active among the politicians of all the Southern States,
though in some cases, Virginia notably, the mass of the people
hesitated, but finally nearly all of the slaves States joined in
the secession.</p>
          <pb id="pendle158" n="158"/>
          <p>The people of South Carolina seized the Federal buildings,
drove out loyal officials, and on the morning of April 12, 1861,
after having demanded the surrender of Fort Sumter, which
was occupied by national troops, fired upon the fort. The
long-looked-for, long-planned-for war was begun! You have
already learned that not all the people who lived in the north
were friends of the Negro, or loyal to the Union. It is also
true that many who lived in the south were true to their country
and believed that all men should be free. But the latter
were very unpopular in their home section.</p>
          <p>In the light of what follows, it is interesting to note that, at
first, neither the government nor the secessionists acknowledged
that slavery had anything to do with the war. The first
claimed that it was a war to preserve the Union, the last, that
the war was to dissolve the Union, and both agreed that it was
“a white man's war.” So when President Lincoln issued his
first call fer troops, the northern Negroes who flocked to the
Union standard were scornfully rejected. In New York some
colored men, hired a room and began to drill, but when the
white people learned of it, they threatened to mob them, and the
Superintendent of Police ordered their drilling to cease.</p>
          <p>One of the leading Virginians said: “It is a gross mistake
to suppose that abolition is the cause of dissolution between
the north and the south. The Cavaliers, Jacobites and the
Huguenots who settled the south naturally hate, contemn and
despise the Puritans who settled the north. The former are
master races, the latter a slave race, the descendants of the
Saxon serfs.” We are told that God maketh the wrath of men
to praise Him, and we know that He is constantly using even
wicked men as instruments to work His will. The Civil War
was a black man's war and it was brought about to redeem
both white and black from the curse of slavery.</p>
          <p>For nearly two years Negroes were denied admission to the
Union army as soldiers and the army acted as a band of slave
catchers, returning runaway slaves to their masters. While
some of the commanding officers rebelled against this, others
<pb id="pendle159" n="159"/>
gave the slave hunters every assistance. Strange to say, as
early as May, 1861, there was a call for “patriotic men of
color” to assist the rebel army and it is said that several companies
of them fought on that side during the war. One wonders
what these men could have been thinking of. However,
the “Creole mulatto” who commanded three companies of
Negro Confederate troops, on guard at the Mint in New
Orleans, allowed his men to be cut off from the retreating white
Confederates, refrained from destroying the Mint, and quietly
surrendered to the Union forces which entered the city.</p>
          <p>In May, 1862, Robert Smalls was pilot of the Confederate
vessel, The Planter, and three other colored men were employed
on the boat—A. Gradine, engineer; William Morrison,
and John Smalls, sailors. While the officers of the vessel
were ashore in Charleston, Robert Smalls, with the help of the
others, carried the boat over Charleston Bar, past Fort Sumter
and delivered it to the commander of the United States ships
which were blockading the harbor. This daring deed was
greatly commended. Smalls was appointed pilot on a Union
boat, promoted to a captaincy in 1863, and placed in command
of The Planter, which position he held until the boat was put
out of commission in 1866.</p>
          <p>In the spring of 1862, Gen. David Hunter, with headquarters
at Hilton Head, S. C., feeling the need of a larger force and
receiving no help from his superior officers, organized and
equipped a regiment of Negroes. When the news reached
Washington, a representative from Kentucky, angrily called
for an investigation of the report. The reply of General
Hunter was at once so pointed and so witty that the matter was
laughed out of Congress, but the courageous general was not
supported in this matter as he deserved; though, a few weeks
later, an order was sent to the military governor in his department
to “arm, equip and receive into the service of the United
States such a number of volunteers of African descent” as
would be useful.</p>
          <p>In the summer of the same year General J. W. Phelps, of
<pb id="pendle160" n="160"/>
the Army of the Gulf, found the work of his soldiers hampered
by the large number of Negroes—men, women and
children—who flocked to his camp. He asked permission to
arm and enlist the men, but was instead told to employ them
in digging ditches, building fortifications, etc. Replying that
he had neither ability nor taste for the position of slave-driver,
General Phelps resigned his commission and returned to his
home in Vermont. Almost before his resignation went into
effect, the point for which he had contended was more than
gained, for in some instances the colored companies were officered
by colored men.</p>
          <p>On January 1, 1863, President Lincoln issued his Emancipation
Proclamation through which the slaves in the rebellious
section drew, for the first time, the breath of liberty, and the
laws which through two hundred years had been, passed to keep
them down, melted into nothingness. If the free men had given
valiant service, imagine with what eagerness the newly freed
slaves enlisted in the Federal army. But they were not always
received with kindness by their brothers in arms; they were
at first forced to suffer many humiliations. Most of those
who had witnessed the valor of the Negro in the war of 1812
were dead and in the minds of both enemies and friends was
the query, “Will the Negro fight?”</p>
          <p>Will the Negro fight! In the very first battle where Negro
companies were given a fair chance—the battle of Port Hudson,
May 20, 1863—they made their mark. With others the
First Louisiana Regiment, General Banks, commander, had
been ordered forward, and before leaving camp, their colonel
had made them a patriotic and inspiring speech, and ended by
addressing these words to the color-sergeant, Anselmas Plancianos:
“Color guard, protect, defend, die for, but do not
surrender these flags.” The sergeant replied: “Colonel, I will
bring back these colors to you, or report to God the reason
why.” And so, animated by the highest sentiments of courage
and patriotism, the black regiment moved against the
enemy. When ordered to charge the rebel fortifications they
<pb id="pendle161" n="161"/>
did so at a rush, but what was the amazement of officers and
men alike to find that between them and the enemy rolled an
impassable stream. It was only about forty feet wide, but the
enemy's guns were turned upon it and as the men reached the
edge of the stream they were mowed down like grass before
the scythe. Seven times this gallant regiment charged toward
the enemy in the hopeless effort to capture the fort, and the
bayou between rolled red with their blood.</p>
          <p>Captain Andre Callieux, “a man so black that he prided
himself upon his blackness,” was in command of Company E.
He rushed out at the head of his men, waving his sword and
crying, “Follow me.” He was struck by a shell and fell dead
and the enemy's guns so covered the place where he fell that
it was not possible to obtain his body. Soon afterward Sergeant
Plancianos proudly bearing the colors, was also struck
by a shell and fell dead, tightly clasping the flag. He went up
to “report to God” the blunder which had needlessly sacrificed
the lives of brave men. A comrade snatched the colors from
his dead hands, and he being almost immediately killed, the
flag was taken by another and borne aloft throughout the
battle. Forty days afterward, the body of Gallioux was reclaimed
and buried in New Orleans with the highest military
and civil honors. The news of the bravery of the black regiment
at Port Hudson spread throughout the country and their
praise was unstinted. The First, Second and Third Louisiana
and the First Engineer Regiment took part in this battle. The
following is an extract from a poem written in honor of the
Black Regiment:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <lg>
              <l>“Freedom,” their battle cry,</l>
              <l>“Freedom, or leave to die!”</l>
              <l>Ah! and they meant the word,</l>
              <l>Not as with us it's heard,</l>
              <l>Nor a mere party shout,</l>
              <l>They gave their spirits out;</l>
              <l>Trusted the end to God,</l>
              <pb id="pendle162" n="162"/>
              <l>And on the gory sod</l>
              <l>Rolled in triumphant blood,</l>
              <l>Glad to strike one free blow,</l>
              <l>Whether for weal or woe;</l>
              <l>Glad to breathe one free breath,</l>
              <l>Though on the lips of death.</l>
              <l>Praying, alas! in vain,</l>
              <l>That they might fall again</l>
              <l>So they could once more see</l>
              <l>That burst of liberty.</l>
              <l>That was what “Freedom” lent</l>
              <l>To the Black Regiment.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Hundreds on hundreds fell;</l>

              <l>Never in field or tent</l>
              <l>Scorn the Black Regiment.</l>
            </lg>
          </lg>
          <p>On the 13th, 14th, and 15th of July, 1863, occurred what
were called the New York Draft Riots. A draft to fill up the
ranks of the Union army had been ordered, and the low-class
whites of the city, claiming that the Negroes were to blame,
formed a plot to kill them all. Of the plotters it is said, “arson
and plunder, murder and maiming were their business and
recreation. Men and women were clubbed to death in the
streets, hung on lamp posts or butchered in their homes. The
infuriated rioters laid in ashes an asylum for colored children,
and the terrified inmates, who fled in every direction, were
pursued and some of the poor children were cruelly beaten and
maimed. The colored people throughout the city were hunted
<pb id="pendle163" n="163"/>
and treated as if they were noxious beasts, and many fled to
the country. Finally, the police, aided by troops suppressed
the insurrection, but not until several hundred human lives
had been lost, and property worth $2,000,000 destroyed.</p>
          <p>The rebels were so angry because Negroes were enlisted to
fight against them that they declared they would kill every
Negro captured, as well as the white men who officered them.
Special vengeance was vowed against General Butler who had
announced that all Negroes who came into his lines were free
as “contraband of war,” and against General Hunter who had
freed and armed those who came to him. In the battle of Milliken's
Bend, La., fought on June 6, 1863, the slaughter was
fearful. It is said “the rebels drove our forces toward the
gunboats, taking colored men prisoners and murdering them.
This so enraged their comrades, that they rallied and charged
the enemy more heroically and desperately than has been
recorded during the war. White and black men were lying side
by side, pierced by bayonets. In one instance, two men, one
white and the other black, were found dead side by side, each
having the other's bayonet through his body. Broken limbs,
broken heads, mangled bodies, all proved that it was a contest
between enraged men on the one side from hatred to a race,
and on the other, desire for self-preservation, revenge for past
grievances and the inhuman murder of their comrades. One
brave man took his former master prisoner and brought him
into camp with great gusto.”</p>
          <p>The 54th Mass., the first colored regiment from the North,
took part on July 18th, 1863, in the battle of Fort Wagner, on
Morris Island, S. C. Col. Robert Gould Shaw commanded,
and the post of honor and of danger, in front of the attacking
column, was assigned to the 54th. “A terrific fire was turned
upon the Union troops, and here the brave Shaw, with scores
of his black warriors, went down fighting desperately.” “What
fighting and what fearful carnage! Hand to hand, breast to
breast, here on this little strip of land, scarce larger than the
human hand, dense masses of men struggled with fury in the
<pb id="pendle164" n="164"/>
darkness, and so fierce was the contest that the sands were
reddened and soaked with human gore.”</p>
          <p>Color Sergeant Win. H. Carney, of New Bedford, dashed
up to the fortifications of the enemy and planted the
Union colors. But the enemy's fire thinned out the regiment, and
Sergeant Carney, being wounded, drew himself up on the
parapet of the fort, still holding the colors aloft. When his
comrades were finally compelled to retire, he crept away, but
did not lower the flag. “When he entered the field hospital,
where his wounded comrades were being brought in, they
cheered him and the colors. Though nearly exhausted with
the loss of blood, he said, ‘Boys, the old flag never touched
the ground.’ ”</p>
          <p>On April 13th, 1864, occurred the horrible massacre of
Union troops at Fort Pillow, Kentucky. There were 557 National
troops in the garrison, 262 of which were Negroes of
the 6th Battery. The rebels, in great numbers attacked the
fort, and after heavy firing on both sides, the attacking party
demanded, under flag of truce, the Union forces to surrender,
saying that if they were compelled to capture the works, they
would give “No quarter.” Major Bradford, the commander,
refused to surrender, when the whole Confederate force
(having crept close to the fort while under flag of truce)
charged the works and gained entrance. “They butchered
black and white, soldiers and non-combatants, men, women
and children. Disabled men were made to stand up and be
shot; others were burned within the tents wherein they had
been nailed to the floor. This carnival of murder continued
until dark and was even renewed the next morning. Major
Bradford was not murdered until he had been carried several
miles on the retreat.” The atrocities committed there made
such an impression upon the Negro troops throughout the
country that in every battle afterward “Remember Fort Pillow”
was their battle cry, spurring them to terrible vengeance.</p>
          <p>“Gen. Benjamin F. Butler commanded a number of Negro
troops at the battle of Fort Harrison where they made one of
<pb id="pendle165" n="165"/>
the most brilliant charges of the war and captured the works
in an incredibly short time, crying “Remember Fort Pillow”
A large number of them were slain and General Butler, who
ten years later, as a member of Congress, was making a speech
on the Civil Rights Bill, referred to Fort Harrison in the following
words: “It became my painful duty to follow in the
track of that charging column, and there, in a space not wider
than the clerk's desk, and three hundred yards long, lay the
dead bodies of five hundred and forty-three of my colored
comrades, fallen in the defence of their country, who had offered
up their lives to uphold its flag and its honor as a willing
sacrifice; and as I rode along among them, guiding my
horse this way and that way lest he should profane with his
hoofs what seemed to me the sacred dead, and as I looked
on their bronze faces upturned in the shining sun, as if in mute
appeal against the wrongs of the country for which they had
given their lives, whose flag had only been to them a flag of
stripes on which no star of glory had ever shone for them— 
feeling I had wronged them in the past, and believing what
was the future of my country to them—among my dead comrades
there, I swore to myself a solemn oath, ‘May my right
hand forget its cunning, and my tongue cleave to the roof of
my mouth,’ if I ever fail to defend the rights of those men
who gave their blood for me and my country that day, and for
their race forever, and God helping me, I will keep that oath.”</p>
          <p>Nearly two hundred thousand Negro soldiers, including a
number of officers, fought during the Civil War; they took
part in scores of battles and always distinguished themselves
for bravery. “At Petersburg, Deep Bottom, Chapin's Farm,
Fair Oaks, Hatchers Run, Farmville, the black soldiers won
for themselves lasting glory and golden opinions.” When the
war ended in 1865, no one asked the question, “Will the Negro
fight?”</p>
          <p>The following is a resumé of the American Negro as a warrior:
“The first blood shed in the Revolution was that of a
Negro, Crispus Attucks, on the 5th of March, 1770. The first
<pb id="pendle166" n="166"/>
blood shed in the war for the Union was that of a Negro,
Nicholas Biddle, a member of the very first company that
passed through Baltimore in April, 1861; while the very first
Negro killed in the war was named John Brown. The first
Union regiment of Negro troops raised during the Rebellion
was raised in the state that was first to secede from the Union,
South Carolina. Its colonel was a Massachusetts man, and a
graduate of Harvard College. The first action in which Negro
troops participated was in South Carolina. The first regiment
of Northern Negro troops fought its first battle in South
Carolina, where it immortalized itself. The first Negro troops
recruited in the Mississippi Valley were recruited by a Massachusetts
officer, Gen. B. R Butler, while their fighting here
was directed by another Massachusetts officer, Gen. N. P.
Banks. The first recognition of Negro Union troops by the
Confederate army was in December, 1863, when Major John
C. Calhoun, a grandson of the South Carolina statesman of
that name, bore a flag of truce, which was received by Major
Trowbridge of the First South Carolina Colored Regiment.
The first regiment to enter Petersburg was composed of
Negroes, while the first troops to enter the Confederate capital
at Richmond were Gen. Godfry Weitzel's two divisions
of Negroes. The last guns fired at Lee's army at Appomattox
were in the hands of Negro soldiers. And when the last expiring
effort of treason had laid our beloved President low in
death, a Negro regiment guarded his remains, and marched
in the stately procession which bore the illustrious dead from
the White House. And on the 15th of May, 1865, at Palmetto
Ranch, Texas, the 62nd Regiment of Colored Troops fired the
last volley of the war.”</p>
          <p>The colored sailors were noted for their valor and the following
colored soldiers received medals of honor from the
government of the United States for heroic conduct during
the Civil War: Sergeant-Major C. A. Fleetwood, Color-Sergeant
A. B. Hilton, Private Chas. Veal, all of the 4th Regiment; 1st Sergeant
James Brownson, Sergeant-Major M. M.
<pb id="pendle167" n="167"/>
Holland, 1st Sergeant Robert Pinn, 1st Sergeant Powhatan
Beaty, 5th Regiment; 1st Sergeant Alexander Kelly, 6th Regiment;
Sergeants Samuel Gilchrist, Wm. Davis, Corporal Miles
James, Private James Gardner, 36th Regiment; 1st Sergeant
Edward Ratcliff, Private William Barnes, 38th Regiment.
The 55th Mass. also played a notable part.</p>
          <p>The Emancipation Proclamation issued by the President
in 1863, was on Jan. 1st, 1865, extended to include the entire
United States and was ratified by Congress in the Thirteenth
Amendment to the Constitution. Hardly had Lee surrendered
to Grant at Appomattox Court House, on April 9th, 1865, than
the whole world was horrified by the assassination of President
Lincoln. Whatever hopes and plans he may have entertained
for the assembling of the scattered forces of the nation and
the bringing about of peace and prosperity, were suddenly
ended. Vice-President Johnson took up the reins of government,
but he proved more a hindrance than a help to re-adjustment,
and the country and the world bewailed the loss of
Lincoln.</p>

          <head>FIFTEEN YEARS OF FREEDOM—1865-1880.</head>
          <p>FREE at last! Free to make a home; free to educate our
children; free to enter business; free to keep our earnings; free
to build churches and publicly worship God!
Free at last! Such was the feeling of thoughtful Negroes at
the close of the war, and this class, North and South, began to
make the most of their opportunities.</p>

            </figure>
          </p>
          <p>Somehow, the idea that the Federal Government would give
to the head of each colored family forty acres of land and a
mule had obtained hold of many minds. Some waited around
to receive the gift, and were laughed at for their pains. But
the very fact that they wanted land and were willing to cultivate
it was a favorable sign; and to have made this dream come
true, would have been a splendid investment on the part of the
United States Government. At the time there were thousands
of acres of unclaimed land, and who can say how much poverty,
misery, disease and crime might have been prevented by
<pb id="pendle169" n="169"/>
turning the freedmen into landowners? But they were largely
left to work out their own salvation, and the end is not yet.</p>
          <p>At the close of the war there were in the South four classes
of white citizens. Those who would not accept defeat and
exiled themselves in foreign lands; those who remained at
home, but refused to take any part in the reconstruction of
their section; those who accepted conditions and did what they
could to help, and those who set themselves to hinder anything
the Federal Government might attempt. The last class seemed
to be the most numerous and the provisional conventions and
legislatures which convened in the southern states just after the
war, passed laws which would slyly undo all that the war and
emancipation had accomplished.</p>
          <p>It became clear that “any reconstruction that denied or postponed
the right of the freedman to the ballot and restored it to
his former master would have been foolish, wicked and disastrous.
This was the judgment of the patriotic statesmen of
that era. They represented a vast majority of the people of
the north, who were in no mood for trifling, but were resolved
that the blood shed and the treasure wasted by the Civil War
should be, as far as possible, compensated for by a re-establishment
of the Union that would preclude all possibility of
another rebellion based upon a demand for state rights or for
slavery in any form.” So the Fourteenth Amendment to the
Constitution, gave full rights of citizenship to all persons born
or naturalized in this country, and by means of this act the
Negro began to feel himself an American citizen.</p>
          <p>But this was more than rebel sentiment could bear and it
finally became necessary to further amend the Constitution and
in 1870 the Fifteenth Amendment, by which the privilege and
duty of voting was extended to all Americans without regard
to “race, color or previous condition of servitude.” During
this period many northern white men took up their residence
in the south, and began to accept election to various public
offices; many of these men were moved by the highest feelings
of philanthropy and patriotism, but others were actuated by
<pb id="pendle170" n="170"/>
selfish motives only. Between the northern politicians and the
Negroes on the one side and the Southerners on the other, there
arose the bitterest enmity. There followed a long series of
brutal outrages, murders, maimings, beatings, burnings of the
Negroes and their northern friends by the southerners, who
had organized themselves into secret societies for the purpose.
But notwithstanding this reign of terror, there were several
Negroes elected to high office during this period.</p>
          <p>Besides a large number who served in the legislatures of the
several states, there were two U. S. Senators, Hiram R. Revels
elected from Mississippi, served from February, 1870,
to March, 1871; Blanche K. Bruce, from Mississippi, served
from March, 1875, to March, 1881. United States Congressmen
were Richard H. Cain, elected from South Carolina,
served in the Forty-third and the Forty-fifth Congresses; Robert
C. DeLarge from South Carolina, Forty-second Congress;
Joseph H. Rainey, South Carolina, Forty-first, Forty-second,
Forty-third, Forty-fourth Congresses; John R. Lynch, Mississippi,
Forty-third, Forty-fourth Forty-fifth Congresses; Benjamin
Sterling Turner, Alabama, Forty-second Congress; Josiah
T. Walls, Virginia, Forty-fourth Congress; James T. Rapier,

Oscar J. Dunn, P. B. S. Pinchback, C. C. Antoine,
in Louisiana; Alex Davis in Mississippi; Alonzo J. Ransier,
Richard Howell Cleaves, South <corr sic="Carolina The">Carolina. The</corr> following entered
the diplomatic service: Ebenezer D. Bassett, Pennsylvania,
United States Minister to Haiti; John M. Langston, Virginia,
Minister Resident and Consul-General to Haiti in 1877;
J. Milton Turner, Missouri, Minister to Liberia; John H.
<pb id="pendle171" n="171"/>
Smyth, North Carolina, Minister to Liberia, 1866-82; Henry
Highland Garnett, Minister Resident and Consul-General to
Liberia. Besides these men and a host of others like them,
there appeared during this period a number of capable women
whose influence was for race advancement; among them were
Mrs. Mary Ann Shadd Carey, Mrs. Fannie Jackson Coppin,
Mrs. Charlotte Forten Grimke, Miss Louise De Mortie, Miss
Mary Jane Patterson, Miss Edmonia Lewis, Miss Martha
Briggs, Mrs. Sarah Jones, Miss Eliza Gardner and others.</p>
          <p>Politicians were not the only northerners who went south
during this time. Hardly had the war closed when a Grand
Army of Peace, an army of Christian men and women left
their homes and all that makes home dear to carry to the freedmen
the light of education, true religion and culture. Of them
there was a great host, too numerous to mention here, whose
work lives after them and will live. Some of those Christian
soldiers went in 1861 to the islands off the Carolina Coast and
took up work among the Negroes there. It is said that upon
these islands, in slavery days, the Negroes had been regarded
as beasts of burden and that they were hardly as well cared
for. “Cleanliness or neatness were as unknown as the alphabet
and decent homelife was nowhere to be found among the
plantation Negroes, to whom the appearance of a white face
was so rare as to frighten the children by its novelty.” The St.
Helena Island, noted for the excellent quality of the cotton
which it produces, is the home of one of the oldest schools for
Negroes in the south. Miss Laura W. Towne, the northern
lady who founded it, has been called the uncrowned queen of
the island. The founding of Penn School was the beginning of
a better time for the islanders and it is said that there is now
hardly in the south a more intelligent, industrious and prosperous
community of colored people.</p>
          <p>Major-General O. O. Howard was appointed Commissioner
of the Freedmen's Bureau, May 20th, 1865. His task was a
huge one, but he was equal to it. “He founded hospitals for
<pb id="pendle172" n="172"/>
the sick, infirm, blind, deaf and dumb, issued food and clothing
to the needy and apportioned land to the worthy. In six
months this bureau had furnished transportation for 1,946
freedmen. In 1870, General Howard reported that the Bureau
had furnished 654 school buildings, employed 9,307 teachers,
and instructed 247,333 pupils; the freedmen themselves supported
and owned 592 school buildings. There was 74 high
and normal schools, and 61 industrial schools; $1,002,896 was
expended and of this sum the freedmen raised $200,000.”</p>
          <p>“The work of education for the Negro at the south had to
begin at the bottom. There had been no schools at all for this
people, and hence, the work began with the alphabet. And
there could be no classification of the scholars. All the way
from six to sixty the pupils ranged in age; and even some who
had given slavery years of their existence—mothers and
fathers in Israel—crowded the schools established for their
race. Some ministers of the Gospel, after a half century of
preaching, entered school to learn how to spell out the names
of the twelve Apostles. Old women who had lived out their
three-score years and ten prayed that they might live to spell
out the Lord's prayer, while the modest request of many departing
patriarchs was that they might recognize the Lord's
name in print.”</p>
          <p>General Howard appointed over the Virginia branch of the
Freedmen's Bureau a young “veteran” of the Civil War, Gen.
Samuel Chapman Armstrong. Realizing the need, General
Armstrong decided to establish “a school to teach both sexes
manual labor as a moral force,” and Hampton Institute, near
Old Point Comfort, was the result. At Hampton every teacher
and every pupil has always been required to live up to the best
that was in him and Hampton graduates have had a mighty
part in race development. Regarding teachers, General Armstrong's
fixed policy was, “In the school the great thing is not
to quarrel, and to get rid of workers whose temperaments are
unfortunate, no matter how much knowledge or culture they
<pb id="pendle173" n="173"/>
may have. Cantankerousness is worse than heterodoxy.” It
is well for us all to remember that it takes more than one sort
of culture to make the desirable citizen—heart culture and
soul culture have a large part.</p>
          <p>By 1879, there was a long list of Negro schools and colleges,
supported principally by northern philanthrophy; most of them
were denominational schools for Methodists, Congregationalists,
Baptists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians and Roman Catholics
all took part in the mental and moral elevation of our race.
Bearing witness to their efforts, besides many primary and secondary
schools, are Atlanta University, Georgia; Berea College,
Kentucky; Leland University, New Orleans; Straight
University and New Orleans University, Louisiana; Shaw
and Alcorn Universities, Mississippi; Biddle University, North
Carolina; Wilberfore University, Ohio; Lincoln University,
Pennsylvania; Claflin University and College of Agriculture,
South Carolina; Central College, Tennessee; Fisk University,
Tennessee; Agricultural and Mechanical College, Hempstead,
Texas; Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, Virginia;
Howard University, Washington, D. C.</p>
          <p>There was, perhaps, in the whole country no greater power
for good at that time than the American Missionary Association,
the A. M. A. as <sic corr="its">it</sic> beneficiaries lovingly call it; Atlanta,
Fisk, Hampton, and numbers of other schools for Negroes,
owe a lasting debt to the heroic band of women and men who
spent themselves and all they owned for the colored people.
Among the true and devoted friends of the Negro, Mr. Robert
C. Ogden has stood for many years.</p>
          <p>A great many colored newspapers were started during this
period, about eight of which number are still being published.
Among Negro authors were Bishop Daniel A. Payne, Rev.
Benjamin T. Tanner, James Monroe Trotter, Sr., Wm. Still and
H. O. Flipper. Throughout this period the Negro, North and
South, began to show to the world his <sic corr="innate">inate</sic> love for music,
and his capacity for high attainment along musical lines. Some
<pb id="pendle174" n="174"/>
noted musicians were Anna Madah and Emma Louise Hyers,
of California; Frederick Eillot Lewis, of Boston; Miss Nellie
E. Brown, of Dover, New Hampshire; Samuel W. Jamison, of
Washington, D. C.; Joseph White, of Matanzas, Cuba; Thomas
Greene Bethune, known as Blind Tom. The latter was
born near Columbus, Georgia, in 1849, but though blind from
birth, he was a born musician.</p>
          <p>He became quite a pet in his master's family and before he
was two years old was able to sing second to anything he
heard. When he was four, a piano was brought to the house
and at his first opportunity, Tom surprised his master's family
by playing several pieces he had heard. When they realized
that he was a genius, they allowed him to play whenever he
wanted to do so and he soon begin to compose “what the wind,
or the birds, or the trees said to him.” Tom finally gave concerts
in many American and European cities. He knew by
heart fully seven thousand pieces and everywhere received the
highest praise from musical critics.</p>
          <p>The Colored American Opera Company was organized in
Washington, D. C., and on February 3rd, 1873, gave its first
performance. Prof. John Esputa was musical director, and
Mr. Henry Donohue, business manager. The principal singers
were Mrs. Agnes Gray Smallwood, soprano; Miss Lena Miller,
contralto; Miss Mary A. C. Coakley, contralto; Mr. Henry
F. Grant, tenor; Mr. Richard Tompkins, tenor; Mr. William
T. Benjamin, baritone; Mr. George Jackson, baritone; Mr.
Thos. H. Williams, basso profundo. The company gave several
presentations of the “Doctor of Alcantara” in Washington
and in Philadelphia, and received favorable comment from
competent critics.</p>
          <p>The Jubilee Singers of Fisk University became famous
through singing the folk songs of the Negro people. “Shortly
after the close of the war a number of philanthropic persons
from the North gathered into an old government building that
had been used for storage purposes, a number of freed children
and some grown persons living in and near Nashville, and
<pb id="pendle175" n="175"/>
formed a school. Professor Ogden was at first in charge, but
ere long the school was taken under the care of the A. M. A.”
When the number of pupils made it necessary to have more
room, the question as to where the money would come from
was answered by Mr. George L. White, one of the teachers.
“He had often been struck with the charming melody of the
‘slave songs’ that he had heard sung by the children of the
school; believing that these songs, so peculiarly beautiful and
heart-touching, sung as they were by these scholars with such
naturalness of manner and sweetness of voice, would fall with
delightful novelty upon Northern ears, Mr. White conceived
the idea of taking a company of the students over the country,
in order to obtain sufficient funds to build a college.” The
company left Nashville in the fall of 1871, and not only toured
the Northern states but went through Great Britain and sang
before the Queen and others of the nobility. They met with
astounding success along all lines, and returned to Nashville
in 1874 with more than ninety thousand dollars.</p>
          <p>During the war, Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy,
pointed out to a visiting Englishman a Negro sleeping
in broad daylight upon a bale of cotton, and said: “He will
never wake up.” Davis was using this Negro as a symbol of
the race and most slaveholders agreed with him. “The Negro
is stupid, he is dumb, he has no soul, he is a beast, he is lost to
the beauties and the duties of civilization, he will never wake
up.” So they soothed each other and excused themselves for
their treatment of the Negro. But the Negro in freedom at
once woke up and began to buy the homes which his masters
had owned, begin to eagerly receive education, to acceptably
fill high positions and in every way to show his manliness.</p>
          <p>His detractors were disappointed and chagrined and they
agreed that “the Negro must be kept down;” they had several
ways of doing this. When the great financial panic of 1873
swept over the country, the attention of the North was turned
to money matters. The Southerners then determined to drive
out the Republican party, and form a Democratic solid South,
<pb id="pendle176" n="176"/>
so their secret societies became more active than ever. Colored
property owners were falsely charged with being “delinquent in
taxes;” employers refused to pay for service rendered on plantations,
by what was called the credit system, the laborers were charged
extortionate prices for their food and clothing, so that it was
impossible for them to get out of debt; the “shot-gun policy” kept
white and colored Republicans from the polls, and this period which
saw the beginning of Republican rule in the South, saw also its end.</p>
          <p>With the end of Republican power came the end of anything like
justice to the Negro and in 1879 about sixty thousand colored people
left the South to find refuge in the North and West. Some thousands
of them scattered through the several states, but the majority made
their home in Kansas. Most of them were destitute, and here again
kind white friends sprang to the rescue, and organized the Kansas
Freedman's Relief Association. “Money and clothing came on every
train and as fast as the association could secure homes for the
refugees they were distributed throughout the state” where, by their
industrious and sober conduct they won the goodwill of all.</p>
          <p>The Freedman's Savings and Trust Company was organized in
1865, and a large number of banks were opened in different cities for
the accommodation of the colored people. At the end of the first
year, $305,167 had been deposited and within eight years about
fifty-seven millions of dollars had been deposited. In 1873, owing to bad
management, the banks failed and carried down with them the hopes
of thousands of poor people who had pinched and contrived in order
to have a bank account. No human being can measure the far-reaching
consequences of that bank failure.</p>
          <p>Negro churches had steadily been growing in number and
influence and their ministers were acknowledged leaders of the
people, and well were they qualified for the task. In the Protestant
Episcopal Church were Bishops Holly and Ferguson,
<pb id="pendle177" n="177"/>
Dr. Alexander Crummell; among Baptists were D. W. Anderson,
L. A. Grimes, Samuel W. Madden, James Poindexter,
Wallace Shelton; in the A. M. E. Z. Church were
Bishop Joseph J. Clinton and others; in the A. M. E. Church
were Bishops Shorter, Payne, Wayman, Campbell, Brown,
Ward, Turner, Dickerson and Cain; among Presbyterians
were Rev. H. H. Garnet and Rev. Francis J. Grimke; in the M. E.
Church were Rev. Marshall Taylor and Rev. Wm. M. Boyd. These
men, and others like them, were pathfinders and
made their mark upon their day, blazing the way for future
generations.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
          <head>HELPS AND HINDRANCES.</head>
          <p>THE years from 1880 onward have witnessed a <sic corr="marvelous">marvellous</sic>
development of the whole human family. During this
period, which has been fitly called the Electric Age, the
Negro has not been idle, and while many things have happened
to discourage him, many others have made for his betterment.
The repeal of the Civil Rights Bill struck the keynote
for adverse legislation, and beginning with Mississippi, in
1890, nearly all of the Southern states have inserted into their
Constitutions clauses by which the right of voting has been artfully
withdrawn from the Negro, thus leaving his interests in
the hands of his avowed enemies.</p>
          <p>To frame laws by which colored people are not allowed in
the regular coaches of the railroads of the South, and are restricted
to certain portions of the street cars, was another step
in the same direction; refusal to accommodate Negroes in
hotels, restaurants and other places of public services; selling
to them only certain seats in places of amusement or absolutely
refusing them admittance to the same, are outrages of
a similar character. The recent attempt to segregate, or confine,
the Negro to certain sections of a city is another example
of the extent to which prejudice will lead those in power.</p>
          <p>Throughout this period, hundreds of the most barbarous
lynchings of colored persons have taken place, not only in the
South but sometimes North and West; race riots have broken
out in several places, but the Atlanta massacre which occurred
in September, 1906, was perhaps the most atrocious affair of
all. The committee of business men who investigated the matter
referred to the whites who had composed the mob as a set
of “toughs who have crucified Atlanta in the eyes of the
world.” These toughs made no attempt to locate accused
criminals, “instead they took those who could be the most
quickly and conveniently found, and these, naturally, were
<pb id="pendle179" n="179"/>
Negroes of the best sort, quietly working at respectable trades
in the center of the city.”</p>
          <p>“Among the victims of the mob was not a single vagrant.
The victims were earning wages in useful work up to the
time of the riot. Most of the dead left small children and
widows, mothers or sisters with practically no means and
very small earning capacity. At least twelve Negroes were
killed and about seventy wounded. Many of the latter are
disfigured or permanently disabled.” It has been said that
one of the results of the massacre, was to bring about a better
understanding between the white and colored citizens of
Atlanta.</p>
          <p>Speaking of the deep significance and awful effect of lynching,
a writer says: “No one can look at one of the photographs
of a lynching, without a sense of abysmal horror. It is not
the horror alone of the thing itself, the ugly, inanimate center
of the tragedy. It is the faces of the spectators that shock our
very souls. They are always laughing faces. Good nature,
even jollity, seems to be the keynote of these <corr sic="gatherings Always">gatherings. Always</corr>
we see the faces of little boys grinning cheerfully toward the
camera. There are women sometimes in the crowd, and sometimes
little girls. There is no sign in these pictures of horror
of death, even of grim satisfaction over a difficult and obnoxious
task performed by necessity. The man who called it
‘lynching bee’ appreciated the true feelings of the lynchers.
Leave out the grim wreck in the center and the picture might
be taken for an ordinary cheerful gathering at a country fair.
Leave it in, and oh, my brothers, it is not the dead, but the
living that terrifies.”</p>
          <p>As has been suggested, the conditions just spoken of and
similar ones have had a discouraging effect upon the colored
people, but, “nothing is settled until it is settled right.” We
know that for two hundred and fifty years our forefathers
endured the yoke of a cruel slavery; but they hoped and
prayed and trusted for the day of freedom. Thousands died
<pb id="pendle180" n="180"/>
before that day dawned, but millions were here to greet it
and multiplied millions are now enjoying it. We have the advantage
of our foreparents; we may not only hope, pray and
trust, but with all the power that is in us we must faithfully
and earnestly work <hi rend="italics">in whatever direction our abilities and convictions
lie,</hi> for the full and perfect freedom which will one
day be ours. Do not doubt, for doubt is the death-knell of
hope; do not despair, for despair is the end of endeavor.</p>
          <p>Said Frederick Douglass, “the destiny of the colored race
is in their own hands, they must bear and suffer, they must
toil and be patient, they must carve their own fortunes, <hi rend="italics">and
they will do it.”</hi></p>
          <p>As you know, Negro churches, schools, benevolent Societies
and other organizations have for years been working toward
racial uplift. In 1881, Bishop Daniel A. Payne organized in
Bethel (now Metropolitan) A. M. E. Church at Washington,
D. C., a Literary and Historical Society, before which organization,
have appeared from time to time, some of the most
brilliantly intellectual men and women of the race; similar organizations
now exist in many cities.</p>
          <p>In 1881 was started at Tuskegee, Alabama, by Booker T.
Washington, a graduate of Hampton, The Tuskeegee Normal
and Industrial Institute. If you remember the plans of the
Negro Convention of 1831, you will see that this school is
similar to the one then mapped out. The story of the rise and
development of Tuskegee is familiar to all as well as the fact
that through it has begun a world-movement for instruction
along industrial lines. A visitor to the twenty-fifth anniversary
of the founding of Tuskegee, held in April, 1896, wrote:
“In the largest degree the hope of the Negro race, the hope
of solving the greatest of all our national problems which
burdens the white race as well as the black, has been bound
up in Tuskegee for twenty-five years and is bound up in it
and its off-shoots today, when a future, none too auspicious,
and fraught with peculiar difficulties, looms ahead.”</p>
          <pb id="pendle181" n="181"/>
          <p>In addition to Tuskegee and the schools named in a previous
chapter, there are more than one hundred colleges and industrial
schools for Negroes, besides the hundreds of primary and
secondary public schools scattered over the country. Comparing
this with the state of affairs in the colonies, the condition
seems to be a hopeful one.</p>
          <p>Although the “forty acres and a mule” failed him, the
Negro has become a landowner on his own account and besides
developing a passion for education, has developed “land
hunger.” “The race that owned scarcely an acre of land fifty
years ago, is now possessor, as landlords, of an area larger
than Belgium and Holland combined,” and is rapidly buying
more. “The desire to own a home is one of the most encouraging
of all traits in the masses of a nation.” Home is
the cradle of the virtues. A man is not quite up to the standard
until he can say proudly to himself “This is my own, my
precious home,” and if he be able to add “and all paid for,”
so much the better. He has given the best possible proof of
his good citizenship.</p>
          <p>In 1888 a handful of colored people, under the leadership
of Mr. Isaiah T. Montgomery, settled in the Yazoo Delta,
Mississippi, and beginning to clear and cultivate the ground,
started what has become known as the town of Mound Bayou.
A Negro town, in the heart of the South, where the mayor,
the council, and all the citizens are colored. Mound Bayou
and similar settlements offer proof of the Negro's ability to
govern himself, and the great contrast between the former
condition and the present progressive state of the surrounding
country is an object lesson.</p>
          <p>Mr. Montgomery was horn in slavery, but his owners were
kind and although it was against the law, some of their slaves
were allowed to learn to read, write and keep accounts. His
early advantages, added to his great natural ability, made
Isaiah Montgomery a natural leader of men, and when the
opportunity came to colonize the section around Mound Bayou
he did not lack for followers.</p>
          <pb id="pendle182" n="182"/>
          <p>“Gradually in the course of twenty-four years the region
around Mound Bayou has altered to an astonishing extent.
There are vast cotton plantations where there was once thin
forests; there are streets of well-built houses, three or four of
which are really remarkable for their architecture and handsome
furniture. There is a Negro bank—the ‘Delta Bank;’
there are one or more cotton ginneries, and a large oil mill for
the manufacture of cotton-seed oil. Within the principal
settlement of Mound Bayou there are four churches and as many
schools. The largest of the churches serves, as do most of
these <sic corr="edifices">edices</sic>, as church, lecture hall, theater, council hall, and
center for debating society. Its interior is entirely lined with
varnished pine planks, exceedingly well fitted, and giving the
interior a handsome appearance, especially when it is lit up
at night by oil lamps and chandeliers. Two of the handsome
houses in the town were constructed by a firm of white builders,
but all the rest of the houses, bank, churches and schools,
were erected by Negro masons and carpenters. There are
good stores in the town, selling most things except alcohol.”</p>
          <p>During the period of which we are talking our white friends
have not forgotten us and of the many practical helps, the bequest
of Mr. George Peabody, which was made in 1867, was
the forerunner of a gift to the Negro alone, of one million of
dollars from Mr. Joseph F. Slater of Norwich, Conn., in
1882. Mr. Slater requested some of the most eminent men
of the country, including the President of the United States,
Rutherford B. Hayes, to act on the Board of Trustees. A
part of his letter to them reads as follows: “The general object
which I desire to have exclusively pursued, is the uplifting of
the lately emancipated population of the Southern States, and
their posterity, by conferring on them the blessings of a Christian
education. The disabilities formerly suffered by these
people and their singular patience and fidelity in the great
crisis of the nation, establish a just claim on the sympathy and
good-will of humane and patriotic men, I cannot but feel the
<pb id="pendle183" n="183"/>
compassion that is due in view of their prevailing ignorance
which exists by no fault of their own.”</p>
          <p>“But it is not only for their sake, but also for the safety of
our common country, in which they have been invested with
equal political rights, that I am desirous to aid in providing
them with the means of such education as shall tend to make
them good men and good citizens, education in which the instruction
of the mind in the <sic corr="common">comman</sic> branches of secular learning
shall be associated with training in just notions of duty
toward God and man, in the light of the holy Scriptures.”</p>
          <p>In 1909, Miss Anna T. Jeannes, a Quaker lady of Pennsylvania,
left two millions of dollars as a fund for the education
of colored people. Hon. Wm. Howard Taft, now President
of the United States, is a member of the Board of Trustees,
and the colored members are Dr. Booker T. Washington,
Major R. R. Moten, Rev. H.T. Kealing and Hon. J. C. Napier.
In 1911, the Trustees of the Slater and Jeannes Funds were
assisting schools in twenty-five hundred communities. Mr.
W. T. B. Williams of Hampton is traveling agent for the
General Education Board.</p>
          <p>The Spanish-American War gave another opportunity to
the Negro soldier to show the spirit within him. For a hundred
years Cuba had been restless under the heavy yoke of
Spain and the people had many times arisen in revolt. During
the revolution which broke out in 1895, the sympathy of the
civilized world was with the Cubans, and when the United
States battleship Maine was destroyed in the harbor of Havana
in 1898, war was declared with Spain.</p>
          <p>The Negro was, as usual, eager to take America's part in
the struggle, and several volunteer companies were raised in
the different states. Four companies of volunteers, known as
the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Immunes, were formed
and officered with colored men from the grade of second lieutenant
down. Brevet-Major Charles E. Young, a graduate
of West Point, was in command of the Ninth Ohio Battalion,
<pb id="pendle184" n="184"/>
and Lieutenant John H. Alexander, also of West Point, served
in Cuba. The Eighth Regiment Illinois National Guards was
entirely officered by colored men, Col. J. R. Marshall commanding.
While in the province of Santiago the Eighth Illinois
did garrison duty for some months after the war and for
a while Colonel Marshall acted as military governor of San
Luis.</p>
          <p>“About one hundred Negro second lieutenants were commissioned
in the volunteer force during the Spanish-American
War. There were two Negro paymasters, John R. Lynch, of
Mississippi, fourth auditor of the United States Treasury, and
Richard R. Wright, of Georgia, president of the State Agricultural
and Mechanical College for colored persons. Two
Negro chaplains were commissioned, the Rev. C. T. Walker,
of Georgia, and the Rev. Richard Carroll, of South Carolina.”</p>
          <p>“The fighting of the black troops in Cuba won the confidence
of the white soldiers and their officers, and was highly
commended. Colonel Roosevelt said that the conduct of the
Ninth and Tenth Cavalry reflected honor on the whole American
people, especially on their own race. Several colored noncommissioned
officers were promoted for gallant conduct in
Cuba.” The Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth Infantry, together
with the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry, comprise the colored
soldiers in the regular army and these soldiers won for
themselves “an unfading halo of glory.” So again, you see,
American Negroes proved themselves, as one writer has said
of the native Africans, to be the greatest natural warriors of
the earth.</p>
          <p>In 1906, colored troops of the 25th Infantry stationed at
Brownsville, Texas, were charged with firing upon the citizens
and President Roosevelt immediately discharged them “without
honor,” from the army.</p>
          <p>Among the Cuban soldiers also, were many intrepid fighters
of African descent; Gen. Quentin Bandera, the famous
black Chieftain, was noted for his fearlessness and bravery.
Until his death, at the age of sixty years, in 1906, General
<pb id="pendle185" n="185"/>
Bandera was greatly beloved by Negro Cubans with whom he
had a powerful influence. Antonio and Jose Maceo, were also
famous generals.</p>
          <p>Organized Negro womanhood has played no small part in
the development of the race and the hundreds of women's
clubs which exist in this country cover nearly every phase of
club work. Colored women have always played a prominent
part in church and benevolent society activities, but beginning
with the later eighties, the women began to recognize the great
need for helping along lines which neither the church nor the
societies touched.</p>
          <p>The chief concern of the individual home is the comfort,
peace and happiness of the men, women and children who
compose it. Women began to see that the village, the township,
the city, the whole country indeed, are merely enlarged
homes, entirely concerned with the well-being of men, women
and children—needing and claiming the enthusiasm, the tender
insight and the ministering care of women as well as the
strength and wisdom of men.</p>
          <p>Almost simultaneously there sprang up in several cities
clubs for the support of Orphan Homes, Homes for the Aged,
Kindergarten, Day Nurseries, etc. In the beginning, the
women's club did not have an easy time. The word “Club”
had been associated in the minds of people with all that was
gay and hilarious, and it took some time to assure people of
the earnestness and seriousness of the Colored Women's Club
Movement. Then there was the barrier which denominations
had drawn and when a club was able to gather women of all
denominations, it was quite a matter for boasting. But such
conditions have passed so long ago that one only vaguely remembers
them.</p>
          <p>There began to be a feeling among club women that a national
organization should be formed and when there appeared
in a Missouri paper in 1895 an article in which Negro womanhood
was atrociously libelled, the Woman's Era Club of Boston,
<pb id="pendle186" n="186"/>
Mrs. Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin, founder and president,
issued a call for a conference between representatives of the
clubs which existed in several states of the Union.</p>
          <p>“About one hundred women representing twenty-five clubs,
from ten different states, composed the conference which attracted
wide attention, because it was the first of its kind and
highly representative of the best intelligence of the women of
the colored race.” An organization was formed of which the
following officers were elected: Mrs. Booker T. Washington,
Tuskegee, president; Mrs. U. A. Ridley, Brooklyn, secretary;
Mrs. Libbie C. Anthony, Jefferson City, Mo., treasurer; Mrs.
Victoria Earle Matthews, New York, chairman of executive
committee.</p>
          <p>In 1896 these women and many others met in Washington,
D. C., and formed the National Association of Colored Women,
of which Mrs. Mary Church Terrell was elected president.
Mrs. Terrell served for three terms, and was succeeded
by Mrs. J. Silone Yates, of Missouri. Mrs. Lucy Thurman
was next president and she was succeeded by Miss Elizabeth
Carter of New Bedford, Mass.</p>
          <p>Among the many clubs which are doing notable work in
their several communities are the Phillis Wheatley Club of
New Orleans, the Loyal Union of Brooklyn, the Woman's
Club of Jackson, Miss., the Women's Loyal Union of New
Bedford, the Dorcas Society of Brooklyn, the Phillis Wheatley
Club of Chicago, the Fresh Air and Empty Stocking Club
of Baltimore, the Lincoln Home Club of Springfield, Ill., the
famous Woman's Era Club of Boston and the Kindergarten
Associations of Atlanta and Charleston.</p>
          <p>The National Association of Colored Women is affiliated
with the National and International Councils of women, and
when some years ago Mrs. Mary Church Terrell appeared
before the latter body at a meeting held in Berlin, and delivered
her address in German, French and English, the incident
created world-wide comment and was looked upon as reflecting
great credit, not only upon the speaker, but upon the race
which she represented.</p>
          <pb id="pendle187" n="187"/>
          <p>Besides those who have served as presidents of the National
the following named women have given loyal and constant
service: Mrs. Booker T. Washington, Tuskegee; Mrs. Jeffries,
Rochester; Mrs. Josephine B. Bruce, Washington; Ida
Joyce Jackson, Columbus, O.; Mary Parrish, Louisville; Josephine
Holmes, Atlanta; Sylvanie Williams, New Orleans.</p>
          <p>The American Negro Academy, founded at Washington, D.
C., in 1897, by Dr. Alexander Crummell, has drawn to itself
from many states some of the most brilliant intellects which
the race has produced. The first officers were: Dr. Crummell,
president; Walter B. Hayson, Kelly Miller and John W.
Cromwell, secretary. Dr. W. E. B. Dubois succeeded Dr.
Crummell as president and was succeeded by Hon. Archibald
Grimke.</p>
          <p>The academy holds an annual meeting at which time matters
of vital interest to the race are ably discussed. From time to
time, in pamphlet form, are published articles of historical or
sociological value by colored authors.</p>
          <p>The National Negro Business League, founded by Dr.
Booker T. Washington, was organized in August, 1900, at Boston,
Mass. The league holds an annual session, and has been
the means of bringing into personal contact business and professional
men from all parts of the country. It has given a
tremendous impulse to the business activities which were in
existence when the league was formed and it has also inspired
others, for in nearly every community there is some enterprise
which owes its existence to the Business League. William
Lloyd Garrison, son of the famous Abolitionist was present
at the first meeting of the league, and delivered all address,
a part of which follows: “The particular word I wish to leave
with you is this: Aim to be your own employers as soon as
poissible. If you are farmers, do not rest until you control the
land on which you live. He who is compelled to till another's
land is in a degree dependent and a bondsman. If you are
mechanics, seek first to own a home without a mortgage, foregoing
<pb id="pendle188" n="188"/>
many things until you are free of debt. Independence
and debt cannot keep company. In the South as in the North,
possession of honestly earned property will surely bring respect
and increase personal security.”</p>
          <p>Perhaps nothing of deeper significance to our country and
our race has happened since the Civil War than the organization,
in 1909, of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People. The association has been called the
New Abolition Movement and it is composed of white and
colored people who have the best interests of the American republic
at heart. Its work is outlined as follows: “The National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People is
an organization composed of men and women of all races and
classes who believe that the present widespread increase of
prejudice against colored races and particularly the denial of
rights and opportunities to ten million Americans of Negro
descent is not only unjust and a menace to our free institutions,
but also is a direct hindrance to world peace and the
realization of human brotherhood.”</p>
          <p>“Methods,—The encouragement of education and efforts
for social uplift; the dissemination of literature; the holding
of mass meetings; the maintenance of a lecture bureau; the
encouragement of vigilance committees; the investigation of
complainants; the maintenance of a bureau of information;
the publication of the Crisis; the collection of facts and publication
of the truth.</p>
          <p>“The officers of the organization are: National President,
Mr. Moorfield Story, Boston, Mass.; Chairman of the Executive
Committee, Mr. Oswald Garrison Villard; Treasurer, Mr.
Walter R. Sachs; Director of Publicity and Research, Dr. W.
E. B. Dubois; Executive Secretary, Miss Mary W. Ovington.”</p>
          <p>The Crisis is edited by Dr. Dubois and the increase in its
circulation has been <sic corr="marvelously">marvellously</sic> rapid. This has been said
to be due almost entirely to the able manner in which it is
edited.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
          <head>TWO WAYS OF THINKING.</head>
          <div3 type="chapter section">
            <p>DURING the period to which the last chapter refers there
arose the two great schools of Negro thought, which, for
want of more exact terms, have come to be known as the
Conservative and the Radical. Briefly stated, the Conservative
school of thinkers lays most stress upon the opportunities
and privileges which Negroes enjoy in this country, while the
Radicals insist upon the rights of which we are deprived. Each
side is most intensely in earnest and both seek the highest good
of the Negro. The difference seems to lie in opinion as to how
this highest good is to be secured.</p>
          </div3>
          <div3 type="chapter section">
            <head>THE CONSERVATIVES.</head>
            <p>The acknowledged leader of the Conservatives is Dr. Booker
T. Washington, the Sage of Tuskegee, while Dr. William E.
Burghardt Dubois, is the accepted leader of the Radicals.
Booker T. Washington was born a slave in 1858 or 1859, in
Franklin County, Va. After the war, the family moved to
West Virginia, and young Booker worked for a while in the
salt furnaces and coal mines, spending his leisure time (of
which he had but little) in learning his letters. But he was
possessed of the passion for knowledge, which, as you know,
characterizes the Negro, and having heard of Hampton Institute,
he determined to go to that school. Going partly on foot,
partly by coach, and partly by railroad, the lad finally reached
Hampton, where, by his industry and determination he completed
the course and made many friends among the teachers.</p>
            <p>When, in 1880 the call came for some one to do the rough
pioneer work of establishing a school at Tuskegee, Ala., Dr.
S. C. Armstrong, founder of Hampton, recommended Mr.
Washington and thus “the man and the hour” met. At
Tuskegee the same ideals prevail which made Hampton a
<pb id="pendle190" n="190"/>
power and no one can measure the good accomplished. Dr.
Washington has had many honors conferred upon him at
home and abroad. Among the most notable of the former is
the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws conferred by Harvard<figure id="ill18" entity="pendl190"><p>DR. BOOKER T. WASHINGTON.</p></figure>
University. During his trips to Europe he has had audiences
with crowned heads and has won the personal friendship of
members of the nobility. Dr. Washington is the author of
several books which are being widely read.</p>
            <pb id="pendle191" n="191"/>
            <div4 type="subsection">
              <head>DR. WASHINGTON'S ATLANTA EXPOSITION SPEECH.</head>
              <p>Perhaps the speech delivered by Mr. Washington upon the
occasion of the opening of the Atlanta Exposition in September,
1895, will explain his position most clearly. It was as
follows:  “One third of the population of the South is of the
Negro race. No enterprise seeking the material, civil, or moral
welfare of this section can disregard this element of our
population, and reach the highest success. I but convey to you,
Mr. President and Directors, the sentiment of the masses of
my race when I say that in no way have the value and manhood
of the American Negro been more fittingly and generously
recognized than by the managers of this magnificent Exposition
at every stage of its progress. It is a recognition that will do
more to cement the friendship of the two races than any occurrence
since the dawn of our freedom.</p>
              <p>“Not only this, but the opportunity here afforded will
awaken among us a new era of industrial progress. Ignorant
and inexperienced, it is not strange that in the first years of
our new life we began at the top instead of at the bottom; that
a seat in Congress or the State Legislature was more sought
than real estate or industrial skill; that the political convention
or stump speaking had more attractions than starting a dairy
farm or truck garden.“</p>
              <p>“A ship lost at sea for many days suddenly sighted a friendly
vessel. From the mast of the unfortunate vessel was seen a
signal: ‘Water, water; we die of thirst.’ The answer from the
friendly vessel at once came back: ‘Cast down your bucket
where you are.’ A second time the signal, ‘Water, water; send
us water,’ ran up from the distressed vessel and was answered,
‘Cast down your bucket where you are.’ And a third and
fourth signal for water was answered: ‘Cast down your bucket
<pb id="pendle192" n="192"/>
where you are.’ The captain of the distressed vessel, at last
heeding the injunction cast down his bucket and it came up full
of fresh, sparkling water from the mouth of the Amazon River.
To those of my race who depend on bettering their condition
in a foreign land, or who underestimate the importance of
cultivating friendly relations with the southern white man, who
is their next door neighbor, I would say, ‘Cast down your
bucket where you are.’ Cast it down in making friends in every
manly way of the people of all races by whom we are surrounded.</p>
              <p>“Cast it down in agriculture, mechanics, in commerce, in
domestic service, and in the professions. And in this connection
it is well to bear in mind that whatever other sins the
South may be called to bear, when it comes to business, pure
and simple, it is in the South that the Negro is given a man's
chance in the commercial world, and in nothing is this Exposition
more eloquent than in emphasizing this chance. Our
greatest danger is, that in the great leap from slavery to
freedom we may overlook the fact that the masses of us are
to live by the productions of our hands, and fail to keep in
mind that we shall prosper in proportion as we learn to dignify
and glorify common labor, and put brains and skill into the
common occupations of life; shall prosper in proportion as we
learn to draw the line between the superficial and the substantial,
the ornamental geegaws of life and the useful. No race
can prosper till it learns that there is as much dignity in tilling
a field as in writing a poem. It is at the bottom of life we must
begin, and not at the top. Nor should we permit our grievances
to overshadow our opportunities.</p>
              <p>“To those of the white race who look to the incoming of
those of foreign birth and strange tongue and habits for the
prosperity of the South, were I permitted I would repeat what
I say to my race, ‘ Cast down your bucket where you are.’
Cast it down among the eight million Negroes whose habits you
know, whose fidelity and love you have tested in days when
to have proved treacherous meant the ruin of your firesides,
<pb id="pendle193" n="193"/>
Cast down your bucket among these people who have, without
strikes and labor wars, tilled your fields, cleared your forests,
<sic corr="built">builded</sic> your railroads and cities, and brought forth treasures
from the bowels of the earth, and helped make possible this
magnificent representation of the progress of the South. Casting
down your bucket among my people, helping and encouraging
them as you are doing on these grounds, and to an education
of head, hand and heart, you will find that they will buy
your surplus land, make blossom the waste places in your fields,
and run your factories. While doing this you can be sure in
the future as in the past, that you and your families will be
surrounded by the most patient, faithful, law-abiding and unresentful
people that the world has seen. As we have proved
our loyalty to you in the past, in nursing your children, watching
by the sick bed of your mothers and fathers, and often
following them with tear-dimmed eyes to their graves, so in the
future, in our humble way, we shall stand by you with a devotion
that no foreigner call approach, ready to lay down our
lives, if need be, in defense of yours, interlacing our industrial,
commercial, civil, and religious life with yours in a way that
shall make the interests of both races one. In all things that
are purely social we can be as separate as the fingers, yet one
as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress.</p>
              <p>“There is no defense or security for any of us except in the
highest intelligence and development of all. If anywhere there
are efforts tending to curtail the fullest growth of the Negro, let
these efforts be turned into stimulating, encouraging and making
him the most useful and intelligent citizen. Effort or means
so invested will pay a thousand per cent interest. These efforts
will be twice blessed—blessing him that gives and him that
takes.</p>
              <p>“There is no escape through law of man or God from the
inevitable.

constitute one-third and more of the ignorance and crime of the
South, or one-third its intelligence and progress; we shall contribute
one-third to the business and industrial prosperity of the South, or
we shall prove a veritable body of death, stagnating, depressing,
retarding every effort to advance the body politic.</p>
              <p>“Gentlemen of the Exposition, as we present to you our humble
effort at an exhibition of our progress, you must not expect
overmuch. Starting thirty years ago with ownership here and there in
a few quilts and pumpkins and chickens (gathered from
miscellaneous sources), remember the path that has led from these to
the invention and production of agricultural implements, buggies,
steam engines, newspapers, books, statuary, carving, paintings, the
management of drug stores and banks, has not been trodden without
contact with thorns and thistles. While we take pride in what we
exhibit as a result of our independent efforts, we do not for a moment
forget that our part in this exhibition would fall far short of your
expectations but for the constant help that has come to our
educational life, not only from the Southern States, but especially
from Northern philanthropists, who have made their gifts a constant
stream of blessing and encouragement.</p>
              <p>“The wisest of my race understand that the agitation of
questions of social equality is the extremest folly, and that
progress in the enjoyment of all privileges that will come to us
must be the result of severe and constant struggle rather than
of artificial forcing. No race that has anything to contribute
to the markets of the world is long, in any degree, ostracized.
It is important and right that all privileges of the law be ours,
but it is vastly more important that we be prepared for the
exercise of those privileges. The opportunity to earn a dollar
in a factory just now is worth infinitely more than the opportunity
to spend a dollar in an opera house.</p>
              <p>“In conclusion, may I repeat that nothing in thirty years
<pb id="pendle195" n="195"/>
has given us more hope and encouragement and drawn us so
near to you of the white race, as this opportunity offered by the
Exposition; and here, bending, as it were, over the altar that
represents the results of the struggle of your race and mine,
both starting practically empty-handed three decades ago, I
pledge that, in your effort to work out the great and intricate
problem which God has laid at the doors of the South, you
shall have at all times the patient, sympathetic help of my race.
Only let this be constantly in mind that, while from the representations
in these buildings of the product of field, of forest,
of mine, of factory, letters, and art, much good will come, yet
far above and beyond material benefits will be that higher good,
that let us pray God will come in a blotting out of sectional
differences and racial animosities and suspicions in a determination 
to administer absolute justice, in a willing obedience
among all classes to the mandates of the law. This, coupled
with our material prosperity, will bring into our beloved South
a new heaven and a new earth.”</p>

            <head>THE RADICALS.</head>
            <p>Dr. William E. B. Dubois was born in Massachusetts, February 23,
1868. He was educated in the public schools of his native State, at
Fisk University, Harvard University, and the University of Berlin. Dr.
Dubois is widely known as a scholar in the broadest sense of the
term—sociologist, teacher, poet,<figure id="ill19" entity="pendl196"><p>DR. W. E. BURGHARDT DUBOIS.</p></figure>
author, and is considered one of the greatest writers on Negro
questions.</p>
            <p>In the world of letters he has received many honors and counts
among his personal friends some of the most scholarly and cultured
personages of the world. Harvard University conferred upon him the
degree of Doctor of Philosophy, and in the great Universal Races
Congress, which convened in London, July, 1911, Dr. Dubois so ably
presented the case of the American Negro as to attract the attention
of thinkers everywhere.</p>
            <pb id="pendle197" n="197"/>
            <div4 type="subsection">
              <head>MANIFESTO OF THE NIAGARA MOVEMENT.</head>
              <p>The Radical point of view may, perhaps, be best explained by the
address to the country at large adopted at the first conference of the
Niagara movement. It reads as follows: “The members of the
conference known as the Niagara movement assembled in annual
meeting at Buffalo, July 11, 12 and 13, 1905, congratulate the
Negro-Americans on certain undoubted evidences of progress in the last
decade, particularly the increase of intelligence, the buying of
property, the checking of crime, the uplift in home life, the advance in
literature and art, and the demonstration of constructive and
exhaustive ability in the conduct of great religious, economic and
educational institutions.</p>
              <p>“At the same time we believe that this class of American citizens
should protest emphatically and continually against the curtailment
of their political rights. We believe in manhood suffrage; we believe
that no man is so good, intelligent or wealthy as to be entrusted
wholly with the welfare of his neighbor. We believe also in protest
against the curtailment of our civil rights. All American citizens have
the right to equal treatment in places of public entertainment
according to their behavior and deserts. We especially complain
against the denial of equal opportunities to us in economic life; in the
rural districts of the South this amounts to peonage and virtual
slavery; all over the South it tends to crush labor and small business
enterprises, and everywhere American prejudice, helped often by
iniquitous laws, is making it more difficult for Negro-Americans to
earn a decent living.</p>
              <p>“Common school education should be free to all American
children and compulsory. High school training should be adequately
provided for all and college training should be the monopoly of no
class or race in any section of our common country. We believe that
in defence of its own institutions, the United States should aid
common school education, particularly in the South, and we
especially recommend concerted
<pb id="pendle198" n="198"/>
agitation to this end. We urge an increase in public high school
facilities in the South, where the Negro-Americans are almost wholly
without such provisions. We favor well-equipped trade and technical
schools for the training of artisans, and the need of adequate and
liberal endowment of a few institutions of higher education must be
patent to sincere well-wishers of the race.</p>
              <p>We demand upright judges in courts, juries selected without
discrimination on account of color, and the same measure of
punishment and the same efforts at reformation for black as for white
offenders. We need orphanages and farm schools for dependent
children, juvenile reformatories for delinquents and the abolition of
the dehumanizing convict-lease system. We note with alarm the
evident retrogression in this land of sound public opinion on the
subject of manhood rights, republican government and human
brotherhood, and we pray God that this nation will not degenerate
into a mob of boasters and oppressors, but rather will return to the
faith of the fathers; that all men were created equal with certain
inalienable rights. We plead for health, for an opportunity to live in
decent houses and localities, for a chance to rear our children in
physical and moral cleanliness.</p>
              <p>We hold up for public execration, the conduct of two opposite
classes of men: The practice among employers of importing ignorant
Negro-American laborers in emergencies, and then affording them
neither protection nor permanent employment; and the practice of
labor unions of proscribing and boycotting and oppressing
thousands of their fellow toilers, simply because they are black.
These methods have accentuated and will accentuate the war of
labor and capital, and they are disgraceful to both sides.</p>
              <p>“We refuse to allow the impression that the Negro-American
assents to inferiority, is submissive under oppression and apologetic
before insults. Through helplessness we may submit, but the voice
of protest of ten million Americans must never cease to assail the
ears of their fellows, so long as America is
<pb id="pendle199" n="199"/>
unjust. Any discrimination based simply on race or color is
barbarous, we care not how hallowed it be by custom, expediency
or prejudice. Differences made on account of ignorance, immorality,
poverty or disease may be legitimate methods of reform and against
them we have no word of protest; but discriminations based simply
and solely on physical peculiarities, place of birth, color of skin, are
relics of that unreasoning human savagery of which the world is and
ought to be thoroughly ashamed. We protest against the Jim Crow
car, since its effect is and must be to make us pay first-class fare for
third-class accommodations, render us open to insults and
discomfort and to crucify wantonly our manhood, womanhood and
self-respect.”</p>
              <p>“We regret that this nation has never seen fit adequately to
reward the black soldiers who in its five wars have defended their
country with their blood and yet have been systematically denied
the promotions which their abilities deserve. And we regard as
unjust the exclusion of black boys from the military and naval
training schools.</p>
              <p>“We urge upon Congress the enactment of appropriate legislation
for securing the proper enforcement of those articles of freedom, the
13th, 14th and 15th amendments of the Constitution of the United
States. We repudiate the monstrous doctrine that the oppressor
shall be the sole authority as to the rights of the oppressed.</p>
              <p>“The Negro race in America, stolen, ravished and degraded,
struggling up through difficulties and oppression, needs sympathy
and receives criticism; needs help and is given hindrance; needs
protection and is given mob violence; needs justice and is given
charity; needs leadership and is given cowardice and apology; needs
bread and is given a stone. This nation will never stand justified
before God until these things
are changed. Especially are we surprised and astonished at the recent
attitude of the Church of Christ—on the increase of a desire to bow
to racial prejudice, to narrow the bounds of human brotherhood, and
to segregate black men in some
<pb id="pendle200" n="200"/>
outer sanctuary. This is wrong, un-Christian and disgraceful to the
twentieth century civilization.</p>
              <p>“Of the above grievances we do not hesitate to complain, and to
complain loudly and insistently. To ignore, overlook or apologize
for these wrongs is to prove ourselves unworthy of freedom.
Persistent, manly agitation is the way to liberty, and toward this goal
the Niagara movement has started and asks the
co-operation of all men of all races. At the same time we want
to acknowledge with deep thankfulness the help of our fellow men
from the Abolitionist down to those who today stand for equal
opportunity and who have given and still give of their wealth and of
their poverty for our advancement.</p>
              <p>“And while we are demanding, and ought to demand and will
continue to demand, the rights enumerated above, God forbid that
we should ever forget to urge corresponding duties upon our
people:</p>
              <p>“The duty to vote.</p>
              <p>“The duty to respect the rights of others.</p>
              <p>“The duty to work.</p>
              <p>“The duty to obey the laws.</p>
              <p>“The duty to be clean and orderly.</p>
              <p>“The duty to send our children to school.</p>
              <p>“The duty to respect ourselves, even as we respect others.</p>
              <p>“This statement, complaint and prayer we submit to the American
people, and to Almighty God.</p>

              <p>Listening, as one often does, to a discussion between ardent
supporters of the Conservative and the Radical schools of
<pb id="pendle201" n="201"/>
thought, one is reminded of the story of the encounter between two
knights of olden times.</p>
              <p>These knights, approaching each other from opposite directions,
When within speaking distance, observed suspended over the road,
a <sic corr="beautiful">beautiul</sic> shield. Said Knight Number One, “I pray thee, friend, what
is the meaning of yonder golden shield?” Knight Number Two
replied, “Its meaning I know not, but I do know that it is a silver and
not A golden shield.” Whereupon, as was the custom in those days,
they challenged each other to combat to decide which of them was
right.</p>
              <p>After a long struggle, having unwittingly exchanged positions,
they glanced upward at the shield and found that each was right, for
while on one side the shield was silver, it was golden on the other.</p>
              <p>So when they realized that “each was partly in the right and each
was partly wrong,” they took down the shield, claiming it as their
common property and clasping hands across it, they swore eternal
fealty. Seeking the main road, the two knights journeyed together,
loyal comrades and the shield was their defense against all enemies.</p>

          <head>THE LIGHT DIFFUSED.</head>
          <p>LOOKING backward nearly two hundred years, we come to the time
of the birth of Benjamin Banneker, who became a scientific farmer, mathematician, astronomer, surveyor,
writer; coming nearer we find Phillis Wheatley, student and literary
genius, and as we approach our own time we are happy to see that the
lights of intelligence, industry and culture which they held aloft have
multiplied in number and increased in brightness and that, today,
there is no sign of waning. There is scarcely a field of human
endeavor into which Negroes have not entered with (all things
considered) astonishing success. Besides the men and women
already mentioned in this book, there are thousands who have made
the most of their abilities and opportunities, some of whom are
known to their respective communities only, while others have
attained a national reputation. It will be readily understood that in so
small a volume as this only a passing reference can be made to a few
persons.</p>
          <p>During the “Electric Age,” the following women, among many
others, have come into prominence: Miss Lucy Laney, founder of
Haines N. and I. Institute; Miss Jennie Dean,
<pb id="pendle203" n="203"/>
founder of Manassas Industrial School; Mrs. Dinah Watts Pace,
founder of a Home for Homeless and Friendless Children at
Covington, Ga.; Mrs. Amanda Smith, founder and manager of an
Orphan Home at Chicago; Miss Amanda R. Bowen, founded and for
many years supported the Sojourner Truth Home for Working Girls
at Washington, D. C.</p>
          <p>The Home for Friendless Girls was founded in Washington, D. C.,
by a number of colored women of whom Mrs. Caroline Taylor was
the leading spirit and president of the association. Mrs. Taylor
literally gave her life for this work, for while inspecting the premises,
she met with an accident which was almost immediately fatal.
Succeeding Mrs. Taylor, her daughter, Mrs. John Pierre, was for
several years president of the association and maintained the work
through many vicissitudes. Mrs. Pierre was succeeded in 1909 by
Mrs. Rosetta E. Lawson.</p>
          <p>Miss Elizabeth C. Carter, president of the National Association of
Colored Women was the moving spirit in the establishment of the
Home for the Aged in New Bedford, Mass. Through Miss Carter's
untiring endeavors, this institution has become one of the most
flourishing of its kind in the country.</p>
          <p>Miss Nannie Borroughs, of Washington, D. C., is the founder
and president of the National Training School for Women and Girls
located at Lincoln Heights, D. C. This school is filling a long-felt
need.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Margaret Murray Washington, of Tuskegee, has for years
been an inspiration and incentive to the women of her community
and of the whole state. These women founded a Reformatory for
Boys and supported it for several years. It. was formally turned over
to the state authorities a short while ago, and the women are
planning other activities.</p>
          <p>Besides her work in women's clubs, Mrs. Mary Church Terrell is
known as an accomplished linguist and is in great demand as a
lecturer.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Eliza E. Peterson, National Superintendent of work
<pb id="pendle204" n="204"/>
among colored people for the National Women's Christian
Temperance Union, is widely known as a consecrated and tireless
worker and a magnetic speaker upon temperance and kindred
subjects. Mrs. Rosetta E. Lawson is a National Organizer in the W.
C. T. U.</p>
          <p>Miss Cordelia Ray is said to be the first colored woman to receive
a diploma as graduate in law. She is also the author of a volume of
poems.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Carrie W. Clifford is a well-known elocutionist and club
woman, and has written a book of poems. Mrs. Fannie Barrier
Williams, of Chicago, is a noted club worker, writer and lecturer. Mrs.
Harriet Gibbs Marshall is the founder and president of the
Washington Conservatory of Music and of the National
Association of Musical and Art Clubs. Mrs. Anna J. Cooper is a well-known
author and educator. Mrs. Carrie Wilder Harris is a member of
the Board of Education of the District of Columbia. Mrs. Addie W. Hunton, Mrs. Emma
Ransome, Mrs. Elizabeth Ross Haines and Miss Cecelia Holloway are
prominently identified with the National Young Women's Christian
Association.</p>
          <p>Miss Hallie Q. Brown has lectured extensively in Europe and
America. Mrs. Ida Wells Barnett toured England and America a few
years ago and aroused sentiment against the lynching evil. Mrs.
Sarah Collins Fernandis, first head resident at Washington Social
Settlement and also at Neighborhood Cottage, East Greenwich, R.
I., is the pioneer trained settlement worker of the race. Mrs. Maggie
L. Walker is President of the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank and of the
St. Luke Emporium, Richmond, Va.</p>
          <p>As school teachers and trained nurses colored women have been
notably successful.</p>
          <p>Col. George W. Williams, the great Negro historian, was born in
Pennsylvania, October 16, 1849, and was educated in private and
public schools. He entered the Union Army and served with
distinction throughout the Civil War. After the war he took a course
in West Newton Theological Seminary,
<pb id="pendle205" n="205"/>
Mass., and later became the editor of the Southwestern
Review. He was at one time judge advocate of the Ohio G. A.
R. His History of the Negro, in two volumes, was published
in 1883, and is the great authority upon the subject. Colonel Williams
was the first colored man ever elected to the Ohio. Legislature.</p>
          <p>Charles W. Chestnut was born in Ohio in 1858. He was reared in
North Carolina, and while yet a youth began to teach
in the public schools of the latter state. Later he became principal of
the State Colored Norm School at Fayetteville. Mr. Chestnut left the
South in 1883 and went to New York and later to Ohio. He
contributed to newspapers and magazines, served as stenographer
and practiced law. As a novelist he is well known. Some of his most
successful works are the “Conjure Woman,” “The Wife of His
Youth,” “The House Behind the Cedars,” “The Marrow of
Tradition.”</p>
          <p>Paul Lawrence Dunbar, aptly called “the Burns of the Negro race,”
has embalmed in poetry and prose much of the pathos, the wit, the
latent music and the hitherto unexpressed
longings of the Negro for the highest things. Dunbar was born in
Ohio in 1872 and though at the time of his death he was still a young
man, he left an indelible mark upon American literature.</p>
          <p>William Stanley Braithwaite, the greatest living Negro poet, was
born in Boston in 1878. When twelve years of age, he left school and
began to learn the printer's trade, Compelled by ill health to change
his occupation, he supported himself by one employment and
another, still studying as best he could, until at the age of twenty he
began to write. In 1904 he published his first book, “Lyrics of Life
and Love.” So far, the Survey of English Poetry from 1557 to 1910 is considered
Mr. Braithwaite's greatest work.</p>
          <p>Dr. William A. Sinclair, Mr. George W. Forbes, J. T. Wilson, W. H.
Thompson, Misses Pauline Hopkins, Angelina Grimke, Jesse Fauset,
E. F. G. Merritt, Messers Barnet N.

Dodson, L. M. Hershaw, Oliver Randolph, F. H. M. Murray, are well
known writers. Alaine Leroy Locke, of Pennsylvania, was the first
colored student to receive a Rhodes scholarship. He studied at
Oxford during 1907-10, and is now at the University of Berlin.</p>
          <p>Among the pioneer newspaper men is T. Thomas Fortune, a native
of Florida. Going to New York he established in 1881 the New York
Globe which later became the New York Age. This paper he edited for
a number of years. The Age is now published by Fred R. Moore. The
elevated tone of the paper, its literary style, abundant information
and mechanical excellence has for many years placed it among the
leading colored publications. Mr. Fortune has published several
books.</p>
          <p>The Washington Bee, W. Calvin Chase, editor and owner, was
first published in 1882, and has been continuously issued. It is one
of the colored publications issued from its own premises.</p>
          <p>John Mitchell of the Richmond Planet (1883) is an aggressive
editor and has done much to expose the lynching evil.</p>
          <p>William Monroe Trotter is the editor of the Boston Guardian, a
paper widely known for its radical stand for manhood rights for the
Negro.</p>
          <p>Edward E. Cooper, founder of the Indianapolis Freeman and later
of the Colored American of Washington, D. C., was one of the most
enterprising of newspaper publishers. The Afro-American of
Baltimore is one of the best known papers in the country. It is edited
by John H. Murphy who has for many years taken an active part in
the civil, fraternal and business life of Baltimore.</p>
          <p>Mr. Chris. Perry, editor of the Philadelphia Tribune (1895) is well
known as an able newspaper man. Other veteran writers are John
Wesley Cromwell, who founded the People's Advocate in 1876;
Charles Alexander of Boston, John E. Bruce, president of the Negro
Society for Historical Research. John C. Dancy was for many years
editor of the Star of Zion and subsequently Recorder of Deeds for
District of Columbia.</p>
          <pb id="pendle207" n="207"/>
          <p>Prominent among church papers are the Christian Recorder, the
<sic corr="Southwestern">Southwesern</sic> Christian Advocate, Star of Zion, American Baptist, A.
M. E. Church Review, Voice of Missions, Presbyterian Herald.</p>
          <p>Dr. Daniel H. Williams, now of Chicago, was born in
Pennsylvania in 1858. He stands among the great surgeons
of our country. “He came into prominence when a very young
man by performing one of the most difficult of surgical operations
on the heart and poricardium, thereby saving the life of
a man who had been stabbed in the heart.” In 1894 Dr. Williams
was appointed surgeon-in-chief of Freedman's Hospital,
Washington, D. C., and remained in that position for several years.</p>
          <p>Dr. Williams was succeeded at Freedman's by Dr. A. M.
Curtis, who has a wide reputation as a successful physician and
surgeon. Dr. R. F. Boyd, of Nashville, is an authority on chemistry,
gynecology and clinical medicine. Boyd's Infirmary, with two large
surgical wards, two operating rooms and twenty rooms has been
recently opened. Dr. William A. Warfield, the present surgeon-in-chief
at Freedman's Hospital, is considered one of the most rapid and
skillful surgeons in the country and the many delicate and difficult
operations performed by him testify to his ability.</p>
          <p>Among other successful physicians are Drs. Marcus Wheatland,
Newport; Chas. E. Bentley and George Hall of Chicago; N. F. Mossell
of Philadelphia; T. E. Bailey and W. J. Thompkins , Kansas City; J. A.

          <p>Henry Ossawa Tanner is rated among the foremost living artists of
the world. Mr. Tanner is a son of Bishop B. T. Tanner of the A. M. E.
Church, and was born in Pittsburg in 1859. He finished the public
school course, and having long felt a desire to study art, he entered
the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Going to Paris, he studied
under Jean Paul Laurens and Benjamin Constant. Mr. Tanner has
received several prizes and medals for excellent work and some of
his paintings hang in the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the
Carnegie Institute, the Wilstach Collection and in the Luxombourg,
Paris. Two of his paintings, “The Return of the Holy Women” and
“The Three Marys” were, in 1911, part of a special exhibit in the
Corcoran Art Galley at Washington.</p>
          <p>In 1876, “at the Philadelphia Centennial, a first prize was awarded
to a beautiful landscape painting called “The Oaks,” and labeled
Bannister. The judges announced the prize, but were amazed when a
modest looking Negro stepped up in answer to the name of Bannister
and took both prize and picture. From that time till his death, some
years ago, Edmond M. Bannister of Boston was recognized as an
artist of much talent   He devoted all of his time to his chosen
profession, painting many pictures which are owned by Boston and
Providence private collections, and when he died, his brother artists
of Providence erected over his grave a beautiful monument in token
of their high esteem.”</p>

          <p>Of Edmonia Lewis, the sculptor, it is said that though “of lowly
birth, left an orphan when quite young, unable to obtain a liberal
education, she nevertheless determined to be somebody and do
something.” When quite a young woman she went to Boston and
there, through the kindness of William Lloyd Garrison, she was
enabled to receive lessons in modeling from Mr. Brackett, the
sculptor. An excellent bust of Robert Gould Shaw, finished in 1865,
was her first piece of importance. Miss Lewis finally obtained the
desire of her heart—to study in Rome—and her work there attracted
much attention, her studio becoming one of the show places of the
student's quarter. In 1876, she brought over to the Centennial
Exposition several well executed pieces. “The only productions of her
later years now in America are contained in the four portrait busts of
Longfellow, Sumner, John Brown and Lincoln in the public library of
San Jose, Cal.”</p>
          <p>The most noted colored musician is the Anglo-African, Samuel
Coleridge Taylor. He was born in London in 1875 and was educated in
that city. His genius showed itself early and he wrote several
compositions. When in his twentieth year, he wrote the wonderful
Hiawatha Triology, a setting to music of portions of Longfellow's
poem. He has also developed a number of the Negro folk-songs and
other compositions of acknowledged merit. “While the world is
admiring Coleridge Taylor, the composer, it must not be forgotten that
he is first of all a master of the violin. Like George Augustine P.
Bridgetower, that other celebrated colored violinist of London (about
1800), for whom Beethoven wrote the “Krutzer Sonata,” and whose
matchless rendering of it in a Vienna concert caused the ecstatic
German to leap from his seat, throw his arms around Bridgetower,
and shout, “Once more, my dear fellow, once more.” Coleridge Taylor
first gained his English reputation with his violin. It is still his favorite
instrument when not composing.”</p>
          <p>Walter H. Loving, of Washington, D. C., organized in the

but in his early youth managed to acquire the foundation for an
education. Later he entered Oberlin College and graduated with
honor. He was a successful lawyer and “as college president, foreign
minister, orator and politician, he exercised a wide influence for the
good of his race. He was one of the bravest of the brave in public
matters and his influence upon young colored men was widespread
and admirable.”</p>
          <p>Hon. John P. Green was born in North Carolina, but when he was a

of essays and sold about fifteen hundred of them. He entered the
high school and completed the course in nearly one-half the required
time, graduating at the head of his class. He studied law in a private

          <p>Since the time in the eighteenth century when Prince Hall presided

          <p>The bishops of the several branches of the Methodist Church

each has had his share in race development. Prominent in the A. M.
E. Church are Bishops Alexander Walters and Geo. W. Clinton; in the
C. M. E. Church are Bishops Holsey, Cottrell, Williams and Phillips; in
the A. M. E. Church, Bishop Daniel Payne was aptly called “The

example, he taught the advantages of learning. You will remember that
he was largely instrumental in buying Wilberforce University in 1863,
and that he established in this connection a number of literary
societies. At the time of his death he was President of Payne
Theological Seminary at Wilberforce. Dr. B. W. Arnett, afterwards
bishop, served
<pb id="pendle216" n="216"/>

died in 1891. Other colored priests are Rev. J. Henry Dorsey,
Rev. C. R. Uncles, Rev. J. J. Plantevigne, Rev. Theobald
and Rev. J. H. Burgess.</p>
          <pb id="pendle217" n="217"/>
          <p>Every minister who feels the responsibility of his office is
a mighty lever for the race, but unless the ministry is encouraged
and supported by the lay members of the church, their efforts
will be greatly hampered.</p>
          <p>It has become quite a common thing among a certain class
of colored people to deride and belittle the church and the
ministry as though Religion were invented yesterday, by Negroes,
for each other's beguiling. It is true, indeed, that infidelity
and agnosticism are by no means confined to the Negro.
But let all the kindreds and tongues and peoples of the earth
conspire together against Jehovah; let them sneer at His wisdom,
His Justice and His might; let them forsake His covenant
and throw down His altars, let them slay His prophets
with the sword; let them make of His house a den of thieves;
even so, may He, who holds Creation in the hollow of His
hand, and yet marks the sparrow's fall, behold, and see the
Negro, though persecuted and afflicted, though cast down and
almost destroyed, still clinging to the Faith once delivered to
the saints, still looking up, even though through blood and
tears, to the ETERNAL GOD.</p>
