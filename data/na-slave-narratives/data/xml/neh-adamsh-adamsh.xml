        <head>PREFACE.</head>
        <p>AT the present juncture, when anti-slavery books are so rife,
and, as it would appear, so acceptable to the reading public, it
is scarcely necessary to apologize for the issue of a work like
the present. It was projected, and partly written, some time
prior to the appearance of that wonderful picture of ”Life
among the Lowly,” by Mrs. Stowe; which has become a
classic in almost every European language, and given such an
impetus to the movement against Negro Slavery, as it, perhaps,
never received before—never certainly from the operation of
one mind and intellect. Other pressing engagements obliged the
Editor to put his little work aside, from time to time, and at
length to complete it more hastily than he could have wished.
The subject is one which will amply repay a very careful and
lengthened investigation—one which might well engage, to the
full extent of its capacity, both the philosophic and
philanthropic mind.</p>
        <p>To those who have had an opportunity of reading that
costly and elaborate volume, entitled “A Tribute for the
Negro” by Wilson Armistead, Esq., this book will afford little
information that is fresh: as comparatively few, however,
could have had this opportunity, it seems desirable to place
before the public, in a cheap and easily accessible form, some
of the most striking facts that could be collected, in refutation
of the opinion, entertained, or at least urged, by some, that the
Negro is essentially, and unalterably, an inferior being to
those who
<q direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“Find him guilty of a darker skin.”</l></lg></q>
<pb id="adamsii" n="ii"/>
and therefore deny him the right of freedom, which is
inalienably his.</p>
        <p>One word as to the title of this book, to which we anticipate
some objections. ”God's Image cut, or carved
in Ebony,” was a phrase first used, we believe, by the English
Church Historian, Fuller,—a sayer of sententious things; and
assuredly this phrase is among the most striking of the graphic
sentences which he stamped so deeply into the walls of the
republic of letters. There it stands, this beautiful and
appropriate piece of imagery, and there it will stand, as long
as those walls endure: and although to some it may appear to
border upon irreverence, yet, with all due respect for those who
think so, we must defend it as a powerful conception of a vigorous
mind, and a lively illustration, applied to a particular case, of
the scripture declaration—”In the image of God created he him.”</p>
        <p>It will be seen, then, that ours is an anti-slavery book, and
<hi rend="italics">something more;</hi> it aims at disabusing a certain portion of the
public mind of what we conceive to be a pernicious error, by
shewing that the Negro is morally and intellectually, as well as
physically, the equal of the white man. If it be urged that our
examples are mere isolated cases, and prove nothing as to the
capacities of the whole Negro race, we say that they are too
numerous to be taken as such, and that if they were not half so
numerous as they are, they would fully prove that our position
is correct. For we are to look at the depressing circumstances
out of which these black brothers and sisters of ours have arisen;
at the almost insurmountable difficulties through which they
have forced their way.</p>
        <p>But we are anticipating the arguments more fully urged in the
introductory chapter, and other portions of our work, to which
we invite the reader's serious attention. A few lines, suggested
by the present aspect of the great anti-slavery struggle, may
perhaps be here introduced as an appropriate conclusion of our
Preface: —</p>

        <head>A SHORT SKETCH OF THE<lb/>
PAST HISTORY AND THE PRESENT POSITION
<lb/>OF THE SLAVERY QUESTION IN AMERICA.</head>
        <p>THE history of “the peculiar institution” in the United
States of America since the Declaration of Independence, is
one fraught with the most astounding wickedness. That a
people who had engaged in a successful struggle for their
political rights;—who had boasted throughout the long and
exciting period of the Revolutionary War that their cause was
that of universal Justice and Liberty; and who had asserted in
their Declaration of Independence that “all men are created
equal;”—that such a people should legalise a slavery which
reduces its victims to the condition of “chattels personal to all
intents, purposes, and constructions whatsoever;” that, in
after years, instead of seeking to abolish it, or to narrow its
boundaries, they should be constantly aiming at, and in too
many instances securing, its extension; and that they should
be seeking to establish it on a permanent basis, and to prevent
agitation against it by Compromise Measures and Fugitive
Slave Laws; that, in short, they should thus perpetuate and
strengthen a tyranny ten thousandfold worse than the British
yoke which they burst asunder, is a national hypocrisy so
terrible, that history fails to furnish a parallel; and is a depth
of moral degradation lower than that into which any other
country has fallen. Well may the poet Whittier, speaking of
his native land, exclaim—</p>
        <lg>
          <l>“Is this, the land our fathers loved,</l>
          <l>The freedom which they toiled to win?</l>
          <l>Is this the soil whereon they moved?</l>
          <l>Are these the graves they slumber in?</l>
          <l>Are we the sons by whom are borne</l>
          <l>The mantles which the dead have worn?”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>There is no doubt that during, and immediately after, the
Revolutionary era, the <hi rend="italicz">gradual</hi> emancipation of every
<pb id="adamsvi" n="vi"/>
slave, on the soil of the new Republic, was regarded as an event
which would not be delayed for many years. Public opinion
was then, unquestionably, in favour of such a course; although,
unfortunately for American honour and the cause of the
down-trodden, the immediate emancipation doctrine of the revered
Dr. Samuel Hopkins was entertained but by few. From the
time of the first American Congress in 1774 until the adoption
of the Federal Constitution in 1789, several legislative bodies,
and numerous associations, conventions, ecclesiastical organizations, 
and public meetings, reiterated the sentiments
indorsed by the Virginian Convention of '74, which were, in
substance, as follows:—“The Abolition of American Slavery is
the greatest object of desire in these colonies.” By an Act of
Congress passed in 1787, Slavery was abolished in Illinois,
Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Iowa; and in the Convention
that prepared the draft of the Constitution, the most thorough
Anti-Slavery sentiments were freely expressed and cordially
received. But, strange to say, notwithstanding these facts, and
the testimonies given against Slavery by statesmen no less
illustrious than Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, and Jay, the
Federal Constitution provided for the reclamation of Fugitive
Slaves, empowered the use of the United States army and navy
to put down outbreaks of the Slaves, and bestowed three votes
to the Slaveholder for every four Slaves he possesses. The
subsequent history of “the peculiar institution” is most
lamentable. True it was that in course of time Slavery ceased to
exist in those States that are north of Mason and Dixon's line;
but it has increased in strength at the South; it has been fortified
by the recreant public opinion of the North; it has widely
extended its boundaries; and it has added millions to its victims.
With the exception of Cassius Clay, in Kentucky, a few Anti-Slavery
Wesleyans in North Carolina, the <hi rend="italics">National Era</hi> newspaper at
Washington, and solitary individuals scattered here and there,
where is to be heard the voice of Anti-Slavery truth on the
Slavery-cursed soil of the South?</p>
        <p>And if we look at the North what do we see? We
find the great political parties chained to the car of
<pb n="vii"/>
Slavery: “The Union and Southern rights”, is their battle-cry.
To be an Abolitionist is to be a “traitor”—to talk of “the rights
of the coloured race,” is to speak in the language of “madmen”—
to deny that the Bible sanctions compulsory servitude, is to be
unpardonably heterodox. Look, too, at the sordid, ambitious,
never-satisfied desire of the Slaveholders for fresh soil upon
which to plant the upas tree of Slavery. Their limits are being
constantly widened; but still they ask for more territory,
heeding not the coming day of retribution, nor the warning
voice of a just God. Since the adoption of the Constitution,
Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisana, Alabama, Mississipi,
Missouri, Arkansas, and, lastly, Texas (all Slave States) have
been added to the Union to weaken the strength of Freedom,
and to add fresh power to that institution which has
somewhere been called “the corner-stone of the Republican
edifice;” and while in 1776 the number of Slaves in the
Southern States was but four hundred and fifty-six thousand,
it is now more than three million two hundred thousand. But
many earnest voices, and many brave hearts, were protesting
against the Pro-Slavery course of American statesmen during
the dark years to which we have hastily referred. Truth was
not without its witnesses; men, and women too, who were
ready not only to devote their lives to the Anti-Slavery work,
despite the storm of obloquy to which they were exposed, but
to meet death itself if such a testimony were needed. Among
the early pioneers of the Anti-Slavery movement, none
deserve more respectful mention than President Edwards, and
Dr. Samuel Hopkins, men who in their day fought the battles
of Freedom with holy faithfulness. Among the greatest of the
heroes of the cause of Abolitionism, William Lloyd Garrison
must ever hold a front rank. It was he who, at a time when his
fellow-countrymen seemed to be wholly prostrate at the feet
of the Slave power, stepped forward, and boldly grappled
almost single-handed with the monster, and, in reply to the
threats of his enemies, declared that he “would be heard;” he
“would not be put down;” but would wage war against Slavery
until either he or it perished in the conflict. The annals of
history do not
<pb id="adamsviii" n="viii"/>
present a brighter example of disinterested and self-denying
devotion to a noble principle. Beautifully appropriate was the
language of the great Anti-Slavery poet adressed to him:—
<q direct="unspecified"><lg><l>“Champion of those who groan beneath</l><l>Oppression's iron hand,</l><l>In view of penury, hate, and death,</l><l>I see thee fearless stand;</l><l>Still bearing up thy lofty brow</l><l>In the steadfast strength of truth,</l><l>In manhood sealing well the vow</l><l>And promise of thy youth.”</l></lg></q>
Garrison was peculiarly the man for the times. Although
one of the people, he possessed a rich and cultivated
intellect, a vigorous and eloquent pen, that accustomed
itself to write the truth with transparent clearness, and
in language terribly just. His powers as an orator,
although inferior to those of his brilliant colleague, the
“golden-mouthed” Wendell Phillips, were of no mean
order, and those who have heard him know how convincing
is his logic, and how scathing is his invective; and above
all he possessed that enthusiastic love of right principles,
which eminently fitted him for the post of a great moral
reformer. We have not space fully to trace the course
of Mr. Garrison and his friends, since he became associated with
Benjamin Lundy in the publication of <hi rend="italics">The Genius of Universal
Emancipation</hi> at Baltimore. While occupying this important post,
he was imprisoned for his energetic denunciations
of a particular instance of Pro-Slavery wickedness, but,
after fifty days confinement, he was released,
through the generous aid of Mr. Arthur Tappan. In January,
1832, the New England Anti-Slavery Society commenced its
important career; shortly afterwards other societies were
organized, and the Anti-Slavery cause began to exhibit a
vitality and a power that alarmed the Slaveholders and their
abettors. Then came the time of trial and persecution, Rewards
were offered for the heads of William Lloyd Garrison, Arthur
Tappan, and other leaders of the Abolition movement. Riots
took place in New York, and Tappan's house was sacked.
Garrison was dragged through the streets of Boston with a halter
<pb id="adamsix" n="ix"/>
round his neck. George Thompson was secreted that he
might escape assassination. The devoted Lovejoy was
murdered for editing an Anti-Slavery newspaper in Alton,
Illinois. Pennsylvania Hall was burned down by an
infuriated gang of Pro-Slavery ruffians. The coloured
people of Philadelphia, Cincinnati, and other places, were
shamefully maltreated. Then with regard to those who,
from their high position, ought to have been the first to
stem the torrent of popular passion, it is a fact that the
legislatures of several Southern States passed resolutions
similar to one adopted by the legislature of North Carolina,
which was as follows:—“Resolved that our sister States
are respectfully requested to enact <hi rend="italics">penal laws,</hi> prohibiting
the printing, within their respective limits, of all such
publications as may have a tendency to make our Slaves
discontented.” To the disgrace of several of the Northern
States, they assented to the propriety of these demands,
which happily, however, were not enforced. An attempt
was then made to prevent Anti-Slavery documents from
being transmitted to the South by post. Then the right
of the Abolitionists to petition Congress against Slavery
was, for a time, successfully assailed; but, mainly through
the labours of John Quincy Adams, in 1845 the right
was restored. But, throughout these long years of the
most unscrupulous opposition, the friends of the Slave
stood by the cause they had taken in hand with unflinching
courage. Some desertions, produced by ecclesiastical
influences, political ambition, love of gain, or cowardice,
have unquestionably taken place, but the Stantons have
been but few in number, while the great mass of the
Abolitionists, like Garrison, Jackson, Quincy, Mrs. Chapman,
and others, have proved faithful always. The persecutions
with which the Abolitionists were attacked, necessarily
helped to increase their numbers and to strengthen their
agitation, by rallying around them multitudes of thinking,
right-minded persons, whose dormant consciences were
awakened by the violence of the advocates of Slavery.
Such is the aid that persecution ever renders to truth</p>
        <p>In 1848 and 1849, an exciting controversy agitated
Congress on what is known as the Wilmot Proviso, which
<pb id="adamsx" n="x"/>
proposed to prevent the existence of Slavery in any
territories that might be annexed to the United States
after it was passed. It was the time of an Anti-Slavery
revival in the Free States; and no less than fourteen
States “protested, through their legislatures, against any
enlargement of the area of Slavery.” This vigorous
agitation caused the Pro-Slavery conspirators to plot
mischief; and the result was an attempt to introduce into the
Union the territory of California as a State, without Slavery
being interdicted on its soil. This “non-intervention”
policy met with the favour of all the great party leaders,
as well as of the Cabinet, as it was confidently believed
that a majority of the citizens of California would vote
for the legalization of Slavery in the State. California
was accordingly urged to apply for admission into the
Confederacy; but, to the horror of the South, and the
astonishment of the whole country, the Constitutional
Convention determined that one of the articles of the new
Constitution, should be as follows:—<hi rend="italics">“Neither Slavery nor
involuntary servitude, except for the punishment of crime,
shall be tolerated in this State;”</hi> and this article was ratified
by the votes of the people. A furious re-action took
place at the South: with black inconsistency, the Pro-
Slavery party in Congress, headed by that embodiment of
despotism, John C. Calhoun, demanded that the application
of California should be rejected! Then followed one of
the fiercest struggles in American history. The writer
was in the United States during this eventful era, and
never shall he forget the intense excitement that prevailed.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the noble example of California, New Mexico
framed an Anti-Slavery Constitution, and asked for admission
into the Union. The advocates of the South then demanded a
compromise—they required that the equilibrium of political
power should be restored. They felt that their influence in the
national councils was imperilled—that a spirit of freedom was
being evoked which, if not speedily quelled, would endanger
the very existence of Slavery itself. Then came the midnight
time of the Anti-Slavery cause. A dissolution of the Union was
threatened by the Slaveholders unless their demands were
<pb id="adamsxi" n="xi"/>
complied with. Never was there a cry more unreal—never was
empty bombast carried to a higher pitch; for if the Union were
dissolved, the fugitive Slave would find the road to freedom
some hundreds of miles shorter than it is now; no Fugitive Slave
Law could then reach him in the Free States; Northern soldiers
could no longer be employed to suppress Slave insurrections, or
to extend the area of Slavery, as in the case of Texas; and how
could thirty thousand Slaveholders put down a rising of their
victims, who are numbered by millions, if they were unable to
appeal to the North for aid? But the miserable cry of “disunion”
answered its base purpose. Symptoms of treachery and
cowardice, dressed up in the borrowed garb of patriotism,
appeared at the North. “Our glorious Union is in danger;” “the
Compromises of the Constitution must be fulfilled;” “the rights
of our Southern brethren must be protected;” and similar cries
were shouted by Northern merchants who held mortgages on
slave-property; who dealt largely in the Southern markets; who
had many Slaveholders among their best customers; or who had
friends and relations possessing a large stake in the man-merchandise
of the peculiar institution; and who for these and
other reasons sold their souls, and allowed their consciences to
be gagged.</p>
        <p>Henry Clay—the statesman who said that “a hundred years'
legislation had sanctified Slavery”—early in 1850 successfully
played his part in the national tragedy. He proposed a
“Compromise.” It was accepted, not, however, without a
severe struggle on the part of a noble band of Free Soilers,
who, in a spirit, and with a courage, more God-like than that of
the ancient Spartans, defended “the Anti-Slavery
Thermopylae” Their championship of freedom was in vain:
Slavery again triumphed. By “the Compromise,” California
was received into the Union as a Free State. New Mexico and
Utah, while they continued territories, and when they were
formed into States, were to maintain or prohibit Slavery, as
they pleased. The importation of Slaves into the District of
Columbia for sale was interdicted. Such were the benefits
conferred on the cause of freedom by “the Compromise:” but now
<pb id="adamsxii" n="xii"/>
for the dark side of the picture. Ten millions of dollars were
paid into the Treasury of Texas, and ninety thousand square
miles of free soil were given to that State, upon which the
accursed institution of Slavery was to be established; and the
Fugitive Slave Law was granted to the South—a measure whose
atrocity language utterly fails to depict; and whose manifestly
flagrant violation of the first principles of justice was so great
that, had not the Congress that passed it, and the President who
sanctioned it, been utterly devoid of moral integrity and the
common feelings of humanity, it would, from the first moment
it was brought forward, have been treated as a proposal fit only
to be entertained by a nation of savages. This law, which is
supplementary to that of the law of 1793, gives extraordinary
facilities for the reclamation of Fugitive Slaves who have found
a refuge in the Free States. It vests all the powers of judge and
jury in Commissioners, who, in the majority of instances, are
appointed in consequence of their Pro-Slavery tendencies, and
who receive ten dollars if they <hi rend="italics">convict</hi> the supposed fugitive,
while five dollars only is their fee if they declare him innocent
of the crime of running away with himself; and, as the Hon.
Horace Mann says, “the law provides that evidence taken in a
Southern State, at any time or place which a claimant may
select, without any notice, or any possibility of knowledge on
the part of the person to be robbed and enslaved by it, may be
clandestinely carried or sent to any place where it is to be used,
and there spring upon its victim, as a wild beast springs from its
jungle on the passer-by; and it provides that this evidence, thus
surreptitiously taken and used, shall be conclusive proof of the
facts, and of escape from slavery. It does not submit the
sufficiency of the evidence to the judgment of the tribunal, but
it arbitrarily makes it conclusive whether sufficient or not.” The
consequence was that four, out of the first eight persons who
were enslaved under this law, were free men. We have it on the
authority of the Hon. Horace Mann that, “in a case in
Philadelphia, Commissioner Ingraham decided some points
directly against law and authority; and when the
<pb id="adamsxiii" n="xiii"/>
decision of a judge of the United States Court was brought
against him, he coolly said he differed from the judge, made out
the certificate, pocketed the ten dollars, and sent a human
being to bondage. <hi rend="italics">There could be no appeal from this iniquity,
for the law allows none.</hi>”</p>
        <p>The Fugitive Slave Law also renders all persons aiding in the
escape of Slaves liable to a fine of two thousand dollars, and six
months imprisonment. A re-action, however, took place. The
arrests of Hamlet, Long, William and Ellen Crafts, and other
Fugitive Slaves, caused an intense excitement in the Northern
mind, which induced thousands to rally around the standard of
liberty, who had never previously been identified with the cause
of the oppressed. The Abolitionists everywhere openly avowed
their intention to violate the law. Numerous mass meetings were
held, at which resolutions were passed denouncing the measure
in the fiercest language, The authorities in some towns refused to
aid in its execution. Some, though not many, ministers, like
Henry Ward Beecher and Theodore Parker, advised their
congregations to obey the “higher law,”and protect the fugitive
even at the risk of imprisonment and death. The Slave-hunters
wherever they went were the subjects of the most unmitigated
public opprobrium and, contempt. A panic at first seized the
coloured population, but their courage did not long fail them.
They provided themselves with revolvers; and, hundreds, if not
thousands, of Fugitive Slaves, armed to the teeth,
fled into Canada to seek that security under the flag of
Queen Victoria which was denied them in the model Republic.
The re-action was so great that, in the language of the Fifteenth
Report of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society,<ref id="ref1" n="1" rend="sc" target="note1" targOrder="U">* </ref> “the Fugitive
Slave Law, though still in our statute books, is shorn of its
terrors, and is fast falling into contempt.” Except in some places where,
the light of Anti-Slavery truth has not effected an entrance,
the Fugitive Slave  Law is almost a dead letter.<ref id="ref2" n="2" rend="sc" target="note2" targOrder="U">†</ref> The
<note id="note1" n="1" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref1"><p>*  An auxillary of the American Anti-Slavery Society, the President of which

<note id="note2" n="2" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref2">† As a proof of this statement, we cull the following from the Buffalo
Republic, a Democratic paper:—“There is at this day, all through
the Free States, four times the sympathy for Fugitive Slaves that there was in
1849. This increase of sympathy produces a corresponding increase of facilities
for safe escape, when once the runaway is out of the territory of Slavedom And
even those who are prejudiced against an increase f coloured population, and
would on that account send information to masters of runaway Slaves, will do
no such thing now, but rather help them over the line, as a most ready way of
getting clear of them. And we do not suppose that there is a ferryman on the
whole frontier that would not take one of them across free, merely for cheating a
cruel statute of its victim.</note>
<pb id="adamsxiv" n="xiv"/>
following statistics carefully prepared by the Rev. Edward
Mathews, the excellent agent to the American Free Mission
Baptists, show that Slavery has not gained much by the
Fugitive Slave Law, while it has lost a great deal of its power
in the North by the outrageous character of the enactment:—
</p>
        <p>
          <figure id="fig1" entity="adamsxiv">
            <p>[Statistical Data]</p>
          </figure>
        </p>
        <p>It will be seen that the total number of Slaves is 50; rescued, 6; shot, 1; purchased, 5; set free after trial, 5; now held in Slavery, 33.<ref id="ref3" n="3" rend="sc" target="note3" targOrder="U">*</ref></p>
        <p>Although the Fugitive Slave Law has almost become a nullity,
it does not necessarily follow that all who oppose it are equally
arrayed against Slavery itself. On the contrary, we have great
reason to believe that a very large proportion of those who
have been strenuous in their hostility to a measure which converts
the Free States into a hunting-ground on which Fugitive
Slaves are to be pursued, do not take any decided action
against the “peculiar institution,”but, on the contrary, are
disposed to allow it to continue undisturbed within its present
<note id="note3" n="3" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref3"><p>*  Mr. Mathews, who prepared the above statistics, was mobbed in Kentucky

<pb id="adamsxv" n="xv"/>
boundaries. We have even heard a, New York audience
cheer a Southern senator when he was boasting that he
was the owner of the largest amount of slave-property
in that part of the South in which he resided; and not
a few meetings have we attended at which speeches in
favour of maintaining the Compromise Measures and the
Fugitive Slave Law were enthusiastically cheered by large
assemblages of persons, in which all classes were represented,
not even excepting the clergy. Everywhere, too, in the
North is the foul prejudice against colour manifested.
The most remote connexion by birth with the African
race is sufficient to render a man an outcast from society;
to prevent him from filling any office of trust or honour;
to make him an object of degradation and contempt; and
to place him in the Negro pew in the very church of
God, so that he may not pollute by his touch the white
believers in that Great Teacher (Himself dark-complexioned!)
who said, “As ye would that others should do unto you,
do ye even so unto them.”</p>
        <p>Such are some of the usages of society in the Free States; and
they apply to such men even as Professor Allen, Frederick
Douglas, Dr. Pennington, Charles L. Remond, and William
Wells Brown, men who, by their characters and talents, would
adorn any society, and who are infinitely elevated above their
miserable oppressors in everything that constitutes true dignity
and moral worth. It is sometimes imagined that universal
suffrage exists in the Free States. This is entirely a mistake; for
no coloured man is allowed the <hi rend="italics">right</hi> to vote unless he
possesses a certain amount of property, which varies in
different States; and as every possible obstacle short of Slavery
itself is placed in the way of his success in life it follows that if
he enjoys the elective franchise he is one of the very few
exceptions to the general rule. The Illinois Legislature has
recently passed a law against coloured persons which is equal
in its infamy to its accursed predecessor, the Fugitive Slave
Law. This measure declares that any Negro or Mulatto
entering the State, and remaining there a longer period than ten
days, shall be fined; and if unable to pay the fine, <hi rend="italics">he shall be</hi>
<pb id="adamsxvi" n="xvi"/>
<hi rend="italics">sold on an auction-block, and the proceeds shall be devoted to
charitable purposes. </hi>What execrable villany! The money raised
by the sale of MEN, created in the image of God, and endowed
with noble intelligences and a still nobler immortality, to be
appropriated to benevolent objects—perhaps to the conversion
of the heathen! Judas Iscariot has many successors. An
enactment somewhat similar was previously passed by the
Legislature of Indiana; so that custom and law are alike the
enemies of that unfortunate race—whose colour is made a crime—
in the Free States of a land boasting of her liberty, and of the
number of her churches. And then, after having sought to keep
them as low as possible in the social scale, hypocritical
apologists for Slavery point, with malevolent exultation, to
their backward condition as a proof that they are a very
imperfect and degraded type of humanity!</p>
        <p>The mercantile influences existing at the North in favour
of Slavery, or of neutrality on the question, are among
its mightiest supporters. The cotton merchants and
manufacturers are averse to any interference with “the
exciting topic,“because it harmonises with their sordid
interest to be on good terms with their “Southern
brethren.” “The agitation of Slavery at the North 
endangers the security of the Union,” say they in effect.
“It might provoke a civil war; it might lead to a general
revolt of the Slaves; in short, twenty things prejudicial
to trade might ensue. Let the South alone: she knows
best what to do with her own institutions. And besides,
are we not seeking to elevate the coloured race by our
support of the Colonization Society? and may not Slavery,
after all, be a Missionary Institution?”—(as the Rev. W.
Hooker, of Philadelphia, says it is)—“the object of which
is, through the Colonization Society, to evangelise the
dark regions of Africa in due time.” We are not now
putting the case unfairly; we are giving the ideas which
are almost daily expressed in that time-serving paper, the
<hi rend="italics">New York Journal of Commerce</hi>, the organ of the
Pro-Slavery merchants of the North. We know not to what
extent any of these individuals may be owners, or part
<pb id="adamsxvii" n="xxvii"/>
owners, of Southern cotton plantations; but we do know
that many a Northern merchant, bearing a high character
for piety, possesses mortgages on slave-estates, and does
not scruple, if his sordid interests demand it, to bring
them to the hammer; and, like a Theological Synod in North
Carolina, who sold eight Slaves to assist in the education
of some Presbyterian ministers, the merchants who thus
dispose of the liberties of their fellow-creatures can, with
the pride of a Pharisee, subscribe towards the conversion of
the inhabitants of Madagascar, or talk of intervention by force
of arms in the affairs Of Hungary against the Austrian oppressor,
as did that creature of Slavery, General Cass.</p>
        <p>Never did these men of “property and standing” show their
subserviency to the South more clearly than after
the passing of the Compromise Measures. In New York,
we remember, some thousands of them signed a requisition
convening a meeting to consider those measures, and to adopt
means for the due execution of the Fugitive Slave Law. We
attended this meeting. Of course the Abolitionists were there
regarded as most detestable characters, being especially the
enemies of “the Union” and the Church. A “Union Safety
Committee” was formed, and some thousands of dollars were
subscribed to its funds; but, with the exception of publishing the
names of all who signed the requisition, and endeavouring to
effect the conviction of a few Fugitive Slaves, we believe that
all their bluster has gone for nothing. The publication
of the names of the requisitionists was a
commercial speculation, inasmuch as Southern traders were
advised not to do business with any merchant in New
York whose name was not printed in the list; indeed at
one time it was proposed that the names of all persons who
<hi rend="italics">refused</hi> to sign the document should be prominently published,
so that their enmity to “Southern rights” might become more
widely known, and their “stores” more generally shunned
by the friends of “the Union.” This was actually done in the
case of Messrs. Bowen and Mc'Namee, the proprietors of that
excellent journal, the <hi rend="italics">New York Independent</hi>, and in one or
<pb id="adamsxviii" n="xviii"/>
two other instances. But it was almost too disgraceful even for
the depravity of New York Pro-Slavery morals. These facts
serve to show what a powerful instrumentality in favour of
Slavery the great commercial party of the North forms.</p>
        <p>As would be anticipated, the two chief political parties—the
Whig and the Democratic—do not essentially differ from each
other in their action on the Slavery question, excepting that
perhaps the greatest number of “fillibusters,” or annexationists,
exist among the Democrats. The Democratic platform adopted
at Baltimore in June, 1850, declared that that party “will abide
by and adhere to a faithful execution of the acts known as the
Compromise Measures settled by the last Congress—the act for
reclaiming fugitives from service or labour included—which act
being designed to carry out an express provision of the
Constitution, cannot with fidelity thereto be repealed, or so
changed as to restore or impair its efficiency. Resolved that the
Democratic party will resist all attempts at renewing in
Congress, or out of it, the agitation of the Slavery question,
under whatever shape or colour the attempts may be made.”
Shortly after the adoption of these principles by the
Democratic party, the Whig Convention was held at Baltimore
also, and a resolution was passed which, after approving of the
Compromise Measures, declared that, “so far as the Fugitive
Slave Law is concerned, we will maintain the same, and insist
on its strict enforcement, until time and experience shall
demonstrate the necessity of future legislation against evasion
and abuse, but not impairing its present efficiency.”</p>
        <p>Enough has been quoted to show that both parties are deeply
involved in Pro-Slavery guilt; and yet many men professing
Anti-Slavery principles (some of whom we could name,) blinded
by party feeling, voted for Pierce, or Scott, as the case might
be, although there was a Free Soil Candidate in the field in the
person of John P. Hale. But although General Pierce is
unquestionably as unsound on the Slavery question as a man
can be, we cannot but rejoice at the defeat of the Candidature
for the Presidency .in their respective party Conventions, of
Webster, Cass,
<pb id="adamsxix" n="xix"/>
and Douglass, men who had sought to raise themselves into the
highest office of the State by their support of the Compromise
measures. They utterly failed to secure the prize which had
caused them to sacrifice their consciences, and to blast their
characters for ever. The first died broken-hearted—miserably
disappointed in the great object of his ambition just as he
thought he had it within his grasp, and conscious that his fame
was darkened with a stain that time could never obliterate.
Thus does judgment sometimes descend on the statesman who,
for the sake of power, dares to trifle with the sacred rights of
humanity, and to act as if he were a God. But let us
<q direct="unspecified"><lg><lg><l>“Revile him not—the Tempter hath</l><l>A snare for all;</l><l>And pitying tears, not scorn and wrath,</l><l>Befit his fall!</l></lg><lg><l>Oh! dumb be passion's stormy rage,</l><l>When he who might</l><l>Have lighted up, and led his age,</l><l>Falls back in night.</l></lg><lg><l>Scorn! would the angels laugh to mark</l><l>A bright soul driven,</l><l>Fiend-goaded, down the endless dark,</l><l>From hope and Heaven?”</l></lg></lg></q></p>
        <p>Franklin Pierce, the present President of the United States, in
his inaugural address, plainly described the policy on the
Slavery question, that would guide him. He said “I believe that
involuntary servitude as it exists, in different states in this
confederacy, is recognized by the Constitution. I believe that it
stands like any other admitted right, and that the states where it
exists are entitled to efficient remedies to enforce the
Constitutional Provisions. I hold that the laws of 1850,
commonly called the Compromise Measures, are strictly
constitutional, and to be unhesitatingly carried into effect. I
believe that the constituted authorities of this Republic are
bound to regard the rights of the South in this respect, as
they would any other legal and constitutional right, and
that the laws to enforce them should be respected and
<pb id="adamsxx" n="xx"/>
obeyed; not with a reluctance encouraged by abstract opinions
as to their propriety in a different state of society, but
cheerfully and according to the doctrines of the tribunals to
which their expositions belong. Such have been and are my
convictions, and upon them I shall act.” It is well known that
he is in favour of the annexation of Cuba, and of the conquest
of Mexico.</p>
        <p>We have glanced at some of the causes of the retrogression
of America as regards Slavery, and of the present powerful
position of the Slaveholders; but we have not yet given that
prominence to the <hi rend="italic">primary cause</hi> which it deserves. We have
no hesitation in pointing to the recreancy of the American
Church as the principal reason why Slavery was not abolished
years ago. Is not trading in human bodies and immortal souls
justified in her pulpits, and sanctioned in her synods and
assemblies? Do not Doctors of Divinity, like Moses Stuart and
Gardiner Spring, blasphemously assert that the righteousness
of American Slavery is proved by the Mosaic law, and allowed
by the religion of Him who said “I come to break the bonds of
the oppressor.” And when the professed ministers of the
Most High, speaking with all the authority of their sacred
office, assert with the Reverend Doctor Joel Parker, (the
<hi rend="italics">threatened</hi> prosecutor of Mrs. Stowe,) that “Slavery is a good—
a great good,” who can wonder that church members should
prove false to the Slave; and that men whose God is Mammon,
should sacrifice the rights of their fellow-man on its altars! To
prove the guilt of the Southern Church, we need not quote
from the sermons of its ministers, or the resolutions of its
synods. The following figures, compiled with great care by the
Rev. Edward Mathews, speak for themselves:—
<figure id="fig2" entity="adamsxx"><p>[Statistical Data]</p></figure>
<pb id="adamsxxi" n="xxi"/>
Six hundred and sixty thousand five hundred and sixty-
three Slaves held by members of Christian Churches in the
South! How frightful is the iniquity perpetrated within the
pale of what professes to be the Church of Christ! Comparing
Slavery to a fearful fire that has been raging for a
long time, Mrs. Stowe admirably remarks “The Church of
Christ burns with that awful fire! Evermore burning,
burning! Burning over church and altar; burning over
senate-house and forum; burning up liberty, burning up
religion! No earthly hands kindled that fire. From its
sheeted flame and wreaths of sulphurous smoke glares out
upon thee the eye of that <hi rend="italics">enemy</hi> who was a murderer
from the beginning. It is a fire that burns to the
lowest hell!”</p>
        <p>But it would naturally be supposed that however the
Southern Churches may have apostatised from the true faith,
yet the religious bodies of the Free States would remain
steadfast in supporting the cause of the oppressed. The
ministers and churches of the South exist amid the
contaminating influences of Slavery itself; but in the North the
church of God can plead no such extenuating circumstances.
How fearful, then, is the fact that many prominent ministers of
the North, defend Slavery as a religious institution; that a still
larger number support the Fugitive Slave Law; and that the
leading ecclesiastical organizations either openly avow their
Pro-Slavery predilections, or endeavour to take a neutral
course; in which latter policy, however, they invariably fail, as
silence on such a question is impossible. Since the Declaration
of Independence, the action of the American Church on Slavery
has more and more retrogressed. At that period the testimonies
against Slavery, in the pulpit and the synod, were very general;
but gradually they have become less and less in number and
faithfulness. The Episcopalian Church in the North, admits
Slaveholders within its pale; and its principal organ, the <hi rend="italic">New
York Churchman</hi>, is notorious for its hostility to the Abolitionists.
An important body of Anti-Slavery men exists among the
Congregationalists, but the vast majority are either Pro-Slavery,
or they adopt a temporizing course. In 1851, Mr. Fisk, who
<pb id="adamsxxii" n="xxii"/>
delivered a sermon in favour of the Fugitive Slave Law, was
appointed by the Maine Congregational Conference, as a
delegate to a kindred religious society. Many prominent divines
of this denomination, (as, for example, Dr. Moses Stuart,) have
distinguished themselves by their advocacy of Slavery. The
Baptist Churches, by their general subserviency to the Slave
power, as well as by the admission of Slaveholders into their
Missionary Society, have earned a dark reputation. The
Presbyterian and the Methodist Episcopal Churches, are
notorious for their unblushing recreancy on the Slavery
question.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gardiner Spring, an eminent Presbyterian minister, whose
<hi rend="italic">evangelical</hi> works are well known in this country, said, in a
sermon which he preached in defence of the atrocious Fugitive
Slave Act, in 1850, that “If by one prayer he could liberate
every Slave in the world, he would not dare to offer it.” We
heard him offer up a prayer, just before an oration was delivered
on General Washington, in which he dared to ask the Almighty
to stop the mouths of the agitators—meaning, of course, the
Abolitionists. The orator was no other than General Foote, then
a Senator for the Slave State of Mississipi, who a few weeks
before had pointed a loaded pistol at the breast of Colonel
Benton, the Free Soil Senator for Missouri, on the floor of the
Senate itself; and would, in all probability, have shot him, had
not the deadly weapon been snatched from his grasp. Dr. Moses
Stuart, the celebrated Professor of Andover College,
Massachussets, says in relation to the Fugitive Slave Law, that
“Though we may <hi rend="italic">pity</hi> the fugitive, yet the Mosaic law does not
authorize the rejection of the claims of the Slaveholders to their
lost or strayed <hi rend="italics">property</hi>.” The Right Rev. Bishop Hopkins, of
Vermont, after having asked “What effect had the Gospel in
doing away with Slavery?” answers to the satisfaction of his Pro-
Slavery heart, “None whatever;” as if Christianity was
responsible for the infamous deeds of her professed disciples!—
as if the glory of Christ should be tarnished by the dark
teachings of an oppression-loving Bishop! The Rev. W. Hooker,
in a pamphlet recently written, again presents Slavery in the aspect in
<pb id="adamsxxiii" n="xxiii"/>
which Calhoun was wont to describe it:—“Allow it then,” says
he, “to be asked of the Christian who duly prizes this highest
freedom, to consider of Southern Slavery as a <hi rend="italics">Missionary</hi>
institution for the conversion of the heathen. In this light let it
be candidly looked on for a  passing moment, and you cannot
fail to contemplate it, for ever, hereafter, with other feelings
than Abolitionism would excite in you.” But similar quotations
might be multiplied without end. The leading<hi rend="italics"> religious</hi> journals,
with the exception of the <hi rend="italics">New York Independent</hi>, and one or
two others, indulge in a similar strain.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bond, the Editor of the <hi rend="italics">Christian Advocate and Journal</hi>,
the principal organ of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
recently described the Abolition movement as a “senseless
agitation.” The infamous character of the chief Presbyterian
newspaper, the<hi rend="italics"> New York Observer</hi>, is well known. As the
most virulent antagonist of Mrs. Stowe and the coarse and
malignant traducer of the Abolitionists, this paper has obtained
one of the darkest places in the foul Pro-Slavery literature of
the day. At the recent meeting of the Presbyterian New School
General Assembly, held at Buffalo, a letter was read from the
Oswego <sic corr="Presbytery">Prebytery</sic>, in which that body refused to send a
delegate to it until it took improved action with regard to
Slavery. The <hi rend="italics">Buffalo Christian Advocate</hi> says of this matter, “The
Slavery question of course had to be disposed of, for whoever
knew a body of Christian ministers to convene in latter times,
when a fire-brand was not thrown into their midst in the form
of this agitation.”</p>
        <p>Slavery is an institution which its advocates cannot bear to
be touched; it shuns the light of investigation. And why?
Because its “deeds are evil.” A severe rebuke was administered
by the Assembly to its refractory auxiliary, and Dr. Cox talked
very glibly about “kicking” the memorial under the table.
Slaveholding, it was true, was declared an “offence;” but then it
was not so if the Slaves were held from humane motives, or in
trust for others, or if the law would not permit their
emancipation; so that this resolution might just as well not
have been passed at all. It was true also that a
<pb id="adamsxxiv" n="xxiv"/>
Committee of Inquiry into the number and condition of the
Slaves held by Presbyterians in the South was talked about; but
the matter was left in the hands of the <hi rend="italic">Slaveholding</hi>
Presbyteries! the criminals were left to convict themselves! At
the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
held a short time ago, the committee appointed to report on the
Slavery question, in reply to certain Anti-Slavery memorials,
recommended that no action should be taken to keep
Slaveholders out of the church. We think these facts show the
guiltiness of the churches of the North in the frightful sin of
Slavery; that both ministers and people have been fearfully
unfaithful to the cause of the down-trodden. And how greatly is
their criminality increased by the fact that if they had aided the
Anti-Slavery cause as they might have done, the “peculiar
institution” would now, in all probability, have ceased to exist;
and at any rate Texas would not have been added to the area,
and the Fugitive Slave Law to the power of Slavery.</p>
        <p>When William Lloyd Garrison and his coadjutors first
commenced the Anti-Slavery movement, it was with the
conviction that their cause would very soon be warmly
espoused by the churches of the North; but their glowing
anticipations quickly vanished. With some honourable
exceptions, those churches, instead of helping the good work,
gave nothing but opposition; and so they who ought to have
been first to engage in the strife with Slavery, were foremost in
the ranks of its friends. It is our pleasing duty, however, to
present some gratifying facts in juxta-position to these
unpleasant ones. In most of the churches a powerful Anti-
Slavery minority exists, who are constantly agitating the
question; but it is a great pity, and, as we think, a serious
neglect of duty, that they do not at once and for ever come out
from these perfidious religious denominations. There are,
however, several important and growing secessions from the
great Pro-Slavery churches. The Wesleyan Methodists,
numbering upwards of twenty thousand members, have seceded
from the Methodist Episcopal Church, and taken
thoroughly Anti-Slavery ground. “No communion with
<pb n="xxv"/>
Slaveholders,” is one of their fundamental principles; and their
weekly organ, the <hi rend="italics">Wesleyan</hi>, edited by the Rev. Lucius
Matlack, is an able advocate of Abolitionism. The American
Baptist Free Missionary Society is equally faithful. The
Presbyterian Secession, the Friends, the Free Will Baptists,
and a few other churches, are also conspicuous for their Anti-
Slavery character.</p>
        <p>There are some ministers of commanding talents and
influence, such as Henry Ward Beecher and Theodore Parker,
who are on the side of the Slave; but, generally speaking, the
<hi rend="italics">great</hi> men and the <hi rend="italics">great</hi> churches are to be found in the ranks of
his enemies. It is in what Theodore Parker calls the “little
churches,” where “the pulpits of commerce” do not exist, that
the true Anti-Slavery spirit is commonly to be found, and as he
truly says, “In little country towns, in the bye-ways and alleys
of great cities, silently and unseen they are sowing the seeds of
a piety, which will spring up justice, and bear philanthropic
fruit.” It is our happiness to know some of the members of
these “little churches,” and we can testify to the important
assistance they are rendering to the enslaved. If a fugitive is to
be tried, they are ever ready to assist him with a competent
counsel, or, if necessary, to aid in his escape; nobody is better
acquainted with the mysteries of “the underground railroad,”
than they; and in all practical operations for the Abolition of
Slavery, they are always up to the mark. Would that the great
bulk of their co-religionists would follow their example! If they
did, the doom of Slavery would soon be scaled for ever.</p>
        <p>But what are the signs of the times in 
America?—what the prospects for the future? This is a question 
that proceeds from many lips, and few can solve the problem to
their own satisfaction. This much, however, is gratifying, that
the progress that has taken place since the American Anti-
Slavery Society was first originated has been very great. The
friends of freedom could then be numbered by scores only;
but now they form a mighty host. Sorry are we that they are
somewhat divided among themselves as to the proper
course of action to be taken;
<pb id="adamsxxvi" n="xxvi"/>
and still more deeply do we regret that in some instances these
dissensions, which are sure to exist in every great movement,
have assumed the form of personal animosities, which must
have done injury to the cause. The Anti-Slavery movement
should be essentially unsectarian: men of all creeds and parties,
who are willing to subscribe to the doctrine of “immediate and
unconditional emancipation,” should be admitted to its fellowship.
Such has been the course of the American Anti-Slavery Society<ref id="ref4" n="4" rend="sc" target="note4" targOrder="U">*</ref>,
from its commencement. Those who have studied the history of
bigotry can readily guess the consequence. A Pro-Slavery Church,
with its usual disregard of the truth, has denounced this great
institution as “infidel” in its character; and numerous timid
Anti-Slavery persons, afraid to be associated with any but the strictly
“orthodox,” have refused to join its ranks, thus preferring to sacrifice
the cause of the Slave at the shrine of a mistaken sectarianism. The
cry of infidelity raised against the Abolitionists at home has, of course,
been shouted abroad. Calumnies the most wicked, perversions
of the truth the most scandalous, have been spread throughout
the length and breadth of Great Britain against the men who are
engaged in the very thickest of the fight with Slavery. The voice
of slander has done its work; but the truth is now being
everywhere known. Again and again have the enemies of the
American Anti-Slavery Society been asked to prove that on any
of its platforms Christianity has ever been treated with the
slightest disrespect, but they have
<note id="note4" n="4" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref4">* In addition to the American Anti-Slavery Society, there are two other
Abolitionist movements, viz: the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society,
and the Liberty party. The operations of the first Society are very limited,
although its Secretary, Mr. Lewis Tappan, fulfils the duties of his office with much
energy. The Liberty party puts an Anti-Slavery interpretation on the American
Constitution, and therefore takes political action. The Free Soilers are not
properly Abolitionists, as they chiefly aim at the <hi rend="italics">non-extension</hi> of Slavery, and
the abolition of that institution in the District of Columbia. The American
Anti-Slavery Society is the great <hi rend="italics">movement</hi>; and we say this without in the
least degree disparaging the valuable labours of such men as Charles Sumner, Horace
Mann, William Jay, Gerritt Smith, John P. Hale, Mr. Giddings, Mr.
Chase, Lewis Tappan, and their associates, who belong to other parties. The
world knows their services; and the Slave has often felt the value of them.</note>
<pb id="adamsxxvii" n="xxvii"/>
utterly failed to do so. No; Christianity has not been attacked,
and they know it full well; but a Church that professes to be
the Christian Church, but which tramples under foot every
precept of Christ—every law of God, has been denounced by
that Society as false to its mission, and hypocritical in its
course. And is not this true? The seven hundred thousand
Slaveholders who are members of religious denominations in
the Southern States, the Pro-Slavery action of most of the
ecclesiastical assemblies of the North, the Negro pews that
exist in almost every Church, and the sermons that have been
preached in favour of Slavery and the Fugitive Slave Law from
multitudes of pulpits, supply an answer in the affirmative
terribly convincing in its truthfulness. What, then, is the duty
of every honest Abolitionist—of every one, too, who has the
interest of the Christian Church at heart? Is it not to pull down
the unfaithful Church, and to raise in its stead a noble edifice in
which, trumpet-tongued, the wickedness of Slavery shall be
preached, and in which the nation shall be commanded to cease
the practice of this great iniquity, not in mild, honied phrases,
but with the same fidelity that characterized the Saviour's
denunciations of Pharasaical hypocrisy? And if such a Church
as this be raised, not less certainly will Slavery pass away,
than did the darkness of the middle ages disappear before the
light of advancing civilization.</p>
        <p>But it is urged against the American Anti-Slavery Society
that it refuses to take political action: hence ensues the absurd
charge that it is opposed to civil government altogether. The
United States' Constitution consists of a foul compromise. It
directly sanctions Slavery; it provides for the capture of
Fugitive Slaves; it vests political power in the Slaveholder
according to the amount of slave-property he possesses. True,
the Liberty party hold that the Constitution is an Anti-Slavery
instrument; but all the great American lawyers put an opposite
construction upon it; and their view seems to us to be clearly
proved. With this belief then, how can an Abolitionist by his
vote sanction this Constitution; for be it remembered that
every member of Congress is required to <hi rend="italics">swear obedience</hi>
<pb id="adamsxxviii" n="xxviii"/>
<hi rend="italics">to it.</hi> Moral honesty requires of the thorough Abolitionist
that he should abstain from declaring allegiance by his
lips to a Pro-Slavery institution, which he spurns with
indignant contempt and hatred in his heart. Then, again,
it is said to the supposed disparagement of the American
Anti-Slavery Society that it is in favour of a dissolution
of the American Union. But if that Union can only be
maintained by a gross sacrifice of principle, can it be
honestly supported by the Abolitionist? Besides, is it
not a disgraceful anomaly that States professing to love
and to support freedom, should live under the same
government with other States who are in the constant
practice of an infamous slavery, and who claim the right
to hunt down its fugitives who seek refuge on Northern soil?
If the American Union is to be kept up on no
other terms than those of subserviency to the slave-power,
then we earnestly trust that the federal compact may be
speedily torn in pieces and scattered to the winds. A
Union based upon such a foundation is what Garrison
termed it—“a covenant with death” and “an agreement
hell;” and with him we would say, “Henceforth
the watchword of every uncompromising Abolitionist, of
every friend of God and liberty, must be, both in a religious
and a political sense, ‘No Union with Slaveholders.’ ”</p>
        <p>Meanwhile this Society is performing its work most
vigorously, and with great success. Various attempts have been
made to hold its Anniversary Meetings in New York, the great
Northern centre of the cotton party; but hitherto, Pro-Slavery
mobs have prevented them. This year, however, they were
succcessful; and the magnificent oration of Wendell Phillips
(grand as a master-piece of eloquence, but more admirable still
for its Christ-like faithfulness) and the glowing speeches of
William Lloyd Garrison, Edmund Quincy, Henry Ward
Beecher, Frederic Douglas, and other apostles of the Anti-
Slavery cause, were listened to with breathless attention by
enthusiastic thousands. The Empire City is awaking; and we
hope soon to hear that neither the power of party platforms, of
the cotton pulpits and newspapers, or of Southern merchants
and planters, can prevent the rapid progress
<pb id="adamsxxix" n="xxix"/>
of genuine Anti-Slavery principles in its midst.</p>
        <p>There are other gleams of light to be seen just now besides
those to which we have alluded. The next to political
annihilation of the great Whig party must do good, as its
members who are favourably disposed towards Anti-Slavery
principles will not have the same temptation to continue their
allegiance to it that they have hitherto had. And some Whig
journals are even now speaking after the fashion of the <hi rend="italics">Forest
City</hi>, published in Cleveland, Ohio:—“We feel as Christian did in
the Pilgrim's Progress, when the load of sin was taken off his
back. We repudiate the Baltimore platform—spit upon it, and
return to the Whig principles of 1847:—‘No executive
usurpation, no more Slave territory, no further extension of
Slavery, no more Slave States, but free soil for free men.’ ”Such
is the repudiation of the Baltimore platform, which we hope to
see become general in the ranks of the Whigs. Similar action has
been taken by the Loco-focos, or Democrats, in Ohio. At their
late State Convention the former Anti-Slavery position of the
party was resumed The important testimonies of Pro-Slavery
journals as to the progress of Abolitionism is equally
gratifying. A rabid Pro-Slavery paper called the <hi rend="italics">New York
Express</hi> said very recently, “That Abolitionism is recovering
from the heavy blows struck at it both in the Whig and the
Democratic Baltimore Conventions, we have not a doubt, as an
evening contemporary intimates, and that it is about to present
a <hi rend="italics">formidable front in the moral and political field, we feel sure</hi>.
The signs of the times all about us indicate this fact. The men
that sustained the Compromise Bill in Congress in 1850, and
so saved the Union from intestine strife, are struck down both
North and South.” “If the increase of Abolitionism goes on, we
have no hesitation in saying no Northern public man can stand
against it.” The tone of the principal organs of the South is
precisely similar. “The South,” says the <hi rend="italics">Charleston Mercury</hi>
the ablest paper in that part of the country, “<hi rend="italics">has no hope
beyond itself</hi>—has no help out of its own dominions. <hi rend="italics">The world
is against it</hi>.” Speaking of the Fugitive Slave
<pb id="adamsxxx" n="xxx"/>
Law the <hi rend="italics">Savannah Georgian</hi> says, “The only hope of
enforcing this law, without an expense of time, money, and
peace more valuable than the Slaves which will be captured, is
to be found in a change, thorough and radical, of the principles
and convictions of the Northern people in relation to Slavery. Is
there any probability of such a change? None whatever.”
Another indication of progress exists in the fact that <hi rend="italics">Uncle
Tom's Cabin</hi>, which is doing so much to create a right public
sentiment in the North, is being read very extensively in the
South.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile the supporters of Slavery are also doing their
best. Again are they turning their avaricious eyes towards
Mexico, hoping to make the refusal of Santa Anna to permit the
Americans to open the River Tehuantepic a pretext for war.
That river is the nearest route to the Pacific; but it runs through
the richest provinces of Mexico. With the fate of Texas before
his eyes, it is no wonder that Santa Anna declines compliance
with the request of the American Cabinet, Cuba is another
object of slave-holding desire; and again do we hear of piratical
expeditions to rob Spain of her wealthy colony. But she will
lose it, and justly too, unless she at once takes steps to abolish
the Slave-trade and emancipate the Slaves. The policy of the
British Cabinet has been energetically directed in favour of such
a result. This is held by a great Democratic writer as
a sufficient reason why General Pierce should take the initiative
by the immediate seizure of Cuba!</p>
        <p>Henry Clay, in the pride of his heart, imagined that his
Compromise Measures would put down Abolitionism and
give the country peace; but the great statesman was miserably
mistaken. He acted as if he had forgotten that there was a God
of Infinite Justice, who can, with a breath, blast the schemes
of cabinets, and cause the most powerful to bow tremblingly
before His authority. Clay did not perceive the power of an
enlightened public opinion, guided by the finger of Him who
is the foe of tyrants, and the hater of iniquity; and who said by
His Son, eighteen centuries ago, that<hi rend="italics"> the Oppressed should
go free</hi>. If he had done so, he never would have
<pb id="adamsxxxi" n="xxxi"/>
proposed those measures which have gained him eternal
infamy, without in the least degree benefitting the cause he sought
to uphold. For they have awakened the conscience of the North
from the deep sleep into which it had fallen; and by the
blessing of God, that conscience shall never slumber again.
They have aroused the Abolitionists to an activity 
unparalleled in their history. They have affected the Church,
and the ministers of the God of liberty are increasing in
number; and in short they show that the last struggles of the
monster which has made the boasted liberty of the Great
Republic a delusion and a lie, have at length come, and that the
era of a glorious freedom is not far distant.</p>

          <p>ETHNOLOGY, or the science of races, has of late years
occupied much of the attention of the learned. Many books
have been written on the subject, and many theories
propounded, to account for the diversities observable in the
physical and mental characteristics of the dwellers upon the
various portions of the habitable globe. Some, in direct
opposition to scripture, have asserted that these distinct
tribes and nations, so diverse in stature, in colour, in language,
and in physical conformation, could not all have
descended from one common parent—that the peculiarities
now observable in the structural anatomy of the different
human races, have always existed, and separated those races
as distinctly, as one tribe of animals is divided from another.
Climate and circumstances are not believed to have had any
influence in these matters, and yet the very author who
advances this opinion,<ref id="ref5" n="5" rend="sc" target="note5" targOrder="U">*</ref> tells us afterwards that race is
permanent, only so long “as the existing media and order
of things prevail.” What are we to understand by this,
if not that climate and circumstances <hi rend="italics">have</hi> power to effect
changes in the human frame, and to produce all those
diversities of character and conformation now observable in
the great divisions of the family of man? We merely mention
this to show the inconsistencies into which scientific
men are often led, when in pursuit of a favourite theory,
the more especially when that theory is at variance with
revealed truth; and to show also that those who contend
for a natural and unchangeable inferiority of race, are not
altogether so perfect in their wisdom, that we should listen
to them in preference to the word of God, who tells us
that He hath “made of one blood all the nations of men, to
dwell upon the face of the earth.” Is it not plain from
this declaration, that all men are brothers—children of one
common parent, aye, of one <hi rend="italics">earthly</hi> parent; for, if by this
<note id="note5" n="5" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref5">* Dr. Knox, <hi rend="italics">vide</hi> “The Races of Men.”</note>
<pb id="adams2" n="2"/>
is meant our Heavenly Creator only, then are we brothers with
the soulless brutes also, and we look in vain for the symbol and
pledge of our humanity; which, although fallen and degraded,
has still lingering about it some faint traces of the god-like and
divine.</p>
          <p>Those who contend that the Negro race is essentially and
unalterably inferior to any other of the distinct races, to use the
ethnologist's term, which occupy the different divisions of the
globe, do so in the face of proofs to the contrary, which one
would think ought to convince them of their error; some of
these proofs it will presently be our task to adduce; just now
we have a few more observations to offer upon the general
bearing of our subject, and aspect of the slavery question.</p>
          <p>That slave-holders, and all who would trample on and
oppress their weaker fellow-men, are advocates for this theory,
is not to be wondered at, they find in it an excuse for their acts
of cruelty and oppression; it places the slave upon the same
low ground as that occupied by their dogs and horses, and,
although the humane man (and we do not mean to deny that
there are many such proprietors of human chattels) would not
overtask or torture even these, yet, the consideration and
respect which is due to every being with an immortal soul, is
lost sight of, and so that the physical wants of his slaves are
satisfied, the master has little care for the imperishable part of
their nature. And this is the most crying evil of the whole
system: bodily torture, cold, hunger, taunts, revilings, toil
beneath the lash of the overseer, nay, death itself, are as nothing
in comparison with this annihilation of every glimmering spark
of the divine light within, (which should be as a lamp to lead the
soul to a Saviour's feet,) which generally ensues in that state of brutal
ignorance in which the slave is allowed to remain, if he be not,
as in most instances he is, kept and bound there.</p>
          <p>Education for the slave is a thing not to be thought of, not to
be tolerated; and so we hear of heavy fines and penalties, and
other punishments, inflicted on those who attempt to teach the
benighted African, dwelling in a so-called christian land, the
way of salvation; and why? because the freedom of the soul from
the thraldom of ignorance and superstition, and sensuality,
must soon be followed by the freedom of the body. If once your
slave gets but a revelation of divine truth, he is a slave no
longer; he knows that other than an earthly master hath bought
<pb id="adams3" n="3"/>
him at a high price; and bind him as securely, watch
him as closely, and torture him as severely as you may;
oh, haughty southern planter! there is a part of him—
the more noble part—which you cannot hold, nor frighten,
nor maltreat. This truth is nowhere more forcibly demonstrated
than in Mrs. Stowe's admirable work: poor Tom
dying under the lash of the fiend-like Legree, was more free
than the sin-bound and embruted creature who owned his
body, because
<q direct="unspecified"><lg><l>“He could read his title clear,</l><l>To mansions in the skies.” </l></lg></q>
And he knew full well, that the trouble and suffering
through which it was his lot to pass, was but as a rugged
gloomy passage to a bright and blissful hereafter. It is Bryant
who bids us
<q direct="unspecified"><lg><l>“Deem not the just by heaven forgot!</l><l>Though life its common gifts deny—</l><l>Though with a crushed and bleeding heart,</l><l>And spurned of man, he goes to die!</l><l>For God hath marked each sorrowing day,</l><l>And numbered every bitter tear;</l><l>And heaven's long years of bliss shall pay</l><l>For all his children suffer here.”</l></lg></q></p>
          <p>The educated and spiritually enlightened slave, we say,
knows all this, and fears not the stripes and injuries which man
can inflict; if he attempt not to escape from his earthly
bondage, which he generally will do, being conscious of his<hi rend="italics"> right</hi>
to freedom, he will shew by his aspect and demeanour, that
he claims a recognition of that common humanity which he
shares with his owner; he is no longer a brute, but a man. And
what so galling to the pride of a tyrannical master, as for that
being of an assumed inferior nature to rise up and claim
brotherhood with him, the delicately-nurtured, the highly-
educated, and refined lord of broad lands, and human chattels.</p>
          <p>To us it seems that no science can be true science, no
philosophy other than spurious, that does not recognise in every
human being, whether his skin be white or sable, a man
and a brother. “The christian philosopher,” says Dr. Chalmers,
“sees in every man a partaker of his own nature,
and a brother of his own species. He contemplates the
human mind in the generality of its great elements. He
enters upon a wide field of benevolence, and disdains the
geographical barriers by which little men would shut out
<pb id="adams4" n="4"/>
one half of the species from the kind offices of the other. Let man's
localities be what they may, it is enough for his large and
noble heart, that he is bone of the as a bone.”</p>
          <p>Let us add to this the testimony of the pious Richard Watson,
which we find quoted in Wilson Armistead's “Tribute for the
Negro,” a noble volume, to which we are indebted for much of
the information contained in the following pages; pointing to the
scripture passage which tells how our Saviour became incarnate,
“that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.”
Watson says, ‘Behold then the foundation of the fraternity of our
race, however coloured, and however scattered. Essential distinctions
of inferiority and superiority had been, in almost every
part of the Gentile World, adopted as the palliation or the
justification of the wrongs inflicted by man on man; but against
this notion, christianity, from its first promulgation, has lifted
up its voice. God hath made the varied tribes of men ‘of one
blood.’ Dost thou wrong a human being? He is thy brother.
Art thou a murderer by war, private malice, or a wasting and exhausting
oppression? ‘The voice, of thy brother's blood crieth to God from the
ground.’ Dost thou, because of some accidental circumstance of
rank, opulence, or power, on thy part treat him with scorn and
contempt? He is thy ‘brother for whom Christ died;’ the incarnate
Redeemer assumed his nature as well as thine. He came into the world
to seek and to save him, as well as thee; and it was in reference to
him also, that he went through the scenes of the garden and the
cross. There is not then a man on earth who has not a
father in heaven, and to whom Christ is not an advocate
and patron; nay, more, because of our common humanity,
to whom he is not a brother.”</p>
          <p>Hear this, ye slave-holding churches of America! and tremble
for the account which you will have to render at the great day of
judgment, when the question shall be asked—What hast thou
done with that poor benighted African—that talent that was given
thee to improve? Hast thou squandered it? Hast thou hidden it
in a napkin; or hast thou used it in any way so that it shall
redound to the glory of God and the good of man? Alas, no! to
use thou hast put it; but to how base a use! Thou hast made it
subservient to thine own pride, and avarice, and sensuality;
and thus bast hast done thy best to efface the glorious image
of its and thy Maker, with which it was
<pb id="adams5" n="5"/>
stamped in the mint of heaven, and to substitute a figure and a
superscription which shall make it pass current in the exchange
of hell. This thou hast done; oh, false professor of a creed of
brotherhood! This thou continuest to do; and what avails it in
the sight of heaven, that thou makest long prayers, and givest
alms to the poor, and teachest and preachest with such
fervency and unction, the holy precepts of christianity, with
which thine <hi rend="italics">actions</hi> have so little agreement?</p>
          <p>How fearful, when thou standest before thy Father,
and thy Judge, to give an account of all that thou hast
done in the flesh, will be the question—“Cain where is thy
brother Abel?” Will thy trembling lips then dare to ask—
“Am I my brother's keeper?”No, for thou wilt know that
thou oughtest to have been his helper, and instructor, and
protector. Will you babble then about the Old Testament
law? Will ye point to the Gospel, and say that Paul sent
Onesimus back to bondage; ye, who have dwelt in the full
blaze of a new dispensation, and who knew, or ought to have
known, that the only bondage referred to by the Apostle, was,
that of christian fellowship, into which the poor disciple was
to be received “<hi rend="italics">as a brother</hi>.” How vain will be all such
subterfuges; and how vain do they seem even now; well may the
poor slave exclaim—
<q direct="unspecified"><lg><lg><l>“Deem our nation brutes no longer,</l><l>Till some reason ye shall find,</l><l>Worthier of regard and stronger,</l><l>Than the colour of our kind.</l></lg><lg><l>Slaves of gold! whose sordid dealings</l><l>Tarnish all your boasted powers,</l><l>Prove that you have human feelings,</l><l>Ere you proudly question ours!”</l></lg></lg></q></p>
          <p>It would be well for those who contend for the inferiority
of the Negro race, and point to the present degraded condition
of the poor Africans, as a proof of that inferiority, to glance
for a moment at Caesar's description of their own ancestors.—
“In their domestic and social habits, the Britons are as degraded
as the most savage nations. They are clothed with skins; wear the
hair of their heads unshaven and long, and shave the rest of their
bodies except their upper lip; and stain themselves a blue colour,
with woad, which gives them a horrible aspect in battle.” Deeply
sunken as they were in ignorance and superstition, uncouth in
appearance, rude in manners,
<pb id="adams6" n="6"/>
savage in war, and in their religious rites cruel and bloody, if
we wish for a parallel picture, we must look to the countries
watered by the Senegal or the Gambia; we shall see there but
the reflex of our own primitive state, and it may well be
questioned whether, if the same opportunities of civilization
and improvement which the aborigines of Britain enjoyed,
were given to the woolly-headed tribes of Africa, they would
not make more rapid advances than did the woad-stained
dwellers in these islands, proud as is the position which they
now occupy in the scale of intellect and morality.</p>
          <p>The Roman orator, Cicero, urges his friend Atticus “not to
buy slaves from Britain, on account of their stupidity, and
their inaptitude to learn music and other accomplishments.”
And he adds, that the ugliest and most stupid slaves
came from this country. No doubt, to the highly civilized
and powerful Romans, the barbarous Angles appeared like an
inferior race, whom it was alike philosophical and humane to
keep in a state of dependence and degradation. In the
correspondence of Dr. Philip, there is an instructive
passage on this head, which we cannot refrain from quoting—
“Seated one day in the house of a friend, at Cape Town, with a
bust of Cicero on my right hand, and of Sir Isaac Newton on my
left, I accidentally opened a book on the table, at that passage in
Cicero in which the philosopher speaks so contemptuously of
the natives of Great Britain. Struck with the curious coincidence
arising from the circumstances in which I found myself; pointing to
the bust of Cicero, and then to that of Sir Isaac Newton, I could not help
exclaiming—Hear what that man says of that man's country.” Dr.
Philip goes on to observe, very truly, that ,“The Romans might
have found an image of their own ancestors in the
representation they have given of ours. And we may form not
an imperfect idea of what <hi rend="italics">our</hi> ancestors were at the time when
Caesar invaded Britain, by the present condition of some of the
African tribes. By them we may perceive, as in a mirror,
the features of our progenitors; and by our own history, we may learn 
the extent to which such tribes may be elevated by means favourable
to their improvement.” To this, we may add, the testimony of
Dr. Pritchard who in his celebrated “Researches into the Physical
History of Mankind,” says, “The ancient Britons were nearly on a
level with the New Zealanders, or Tahitians of the present day or
perhaps not very superior to the Australians.” And
<pb id="adams7" n="7"/>
again, “Of all pagan nations, the Gauls and Britons appear
to have had the most sanguinary rites. They may well be
compared, in this respect, to the Ashante, Dahomehs, and
other nations of Western Africa.” Let us talk no longer then of
inferiority of race.—
<q direct="unspecified"><lg><l>“Let us not then the negro slave despise;</l><l>just such our sires appeared in Caesar's eyes.”</l></lg></q></p>
          <p>Instances might be cited, in which, what are generally
considered as the distinctive marks of the negro race, have
become greatly modified under the influence of a change of
climate and circumstances, in the course of one or two
generations; and even in the same individual a wonderful change
has been observed to take place, after his shackles have been
loosed, his mind enlightened, his physical wants satisfied, and
his natural feelings and affections studied and respected.
Frederick Douglass, cowering under the lash of Covey, the
slave-breaker, half-starved and scantily clothed, and beaten like
a dog, is a very different being from he who lately stood up
before a British audience, in a land of freedom, himself as free
as any there, and electrified thousands by his thrilling
eloquence. Gilbert, like a true artist as he is, has finely depicted
this difference in “Uncle Tom's Cabin Almanack.” Let our
readers look on the two pictures, and ask themselves,
admirably as the likeness is preserved, if it <hi rend="italics">can</hi> be the same
individual, here grovelling on the earth, and terror-stricken at
the expected punishment, like the mere animal; there upright,
as a <hi rend="italics">man</hi> should be, with flashing eyes, and a countenance
lighted with intelligence.</p>
          <p>Look again at poor Pennington, the scared run-away, when
he entered with a trembling heart and hesitating steps, the
presence of the benevolent quaker, who sheltered and fed
him for awhile; and again ask yourselves—Can this be he
who afterwards became so efficient a minister of the Gospel
of Christ; who stood up on the platform at the Paris Peace
Convention, and delivered so beautiful and impressive a
speech; “whose amiable and gentlemanly deportment, pliant
and elegant mind, and culture and power of intellect, have won
for him the esteem of very many, while his eloquence and pathos
have touched the hearts of multitudes who have been privileged to
hear him;” and on whom, a German University, from whose
venerable walls have gone forth masters in the loftiest
departments of human lore, has conferred the honourable
distinction of D. D.?</p>
          <pb id="adams8" n="8"/>
          <p>Look again at Josiah Henson, at William Wells Brown, and
others, whose biographies will be presently given, in their
enslaved and free state; mark the difference, and then ask
yourselves another question:—Can these noble specimens of
God's handiworks—these enlightened, high-souled christian men,
belong to an inferior race? Can we believe this? no, the rather let
us agree with the wise and benevolent Dr. Channing, who
addresses his countrymen thus:—</p>
          <p>“We are holding in bondage one of the best races of the
human family. The Negro is among the mildest and gentlest of
men. He is singularly susceptible of improvement from abroad.
His children, it is said, receive more rapidly than ours the
elements of knowledge. How far he can originate
improvements, time alone can teach. His nature is affectionate,
easily touched; and hence he is more open to religious
impressions than the white man. The European races have
manifested more courage, enterprise, invention; but in the
dispositions which Christianity particularly honours, how
inferior are they to the African! When I cast my eyes over our
southern region,  the land of bowie knives, Lynch law and duels—
of chivalry honour, and revenge—and when I consider that
Christianity is declared to be a spirit of charity, ‘'which seeketh
not its own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and
endureth all things,’—can I hesitate in deciding to which of the
races in that land Christianity is most adapted and in which its
noblest disciples are likely to be reared.”</p>
          <p>Elsewhere this eloquent advocate of the oppressed Negro
makes the following forcible observations:—“The moral
influence of slavery is to destroy the proper consciousness and spirit
of a man. The slave, regarded and treated as property, bought
and sold like a brute, denied the rights of humanity, unprotected
against insult, made a tool, and systematically subdued, that he
may be a manageable useful tool, how can he help regarding
himself as fallen below his race? How must his spirit be
crushed? How can he respect himself? He becomes bowed to
servility. This word, borrowed from his condition, expresses
the ruin wrought by slavery within him. The idea that he was
made for his own virtue and happiness scarcely dawns on his
mind. To be an instrument of the physical, material good of
another, whose will is his highest law, he is taught to regard as
the great purpose of his being. The whips and imprisonment of
slavery, and even the horrors of the middle passage from Africa
to America, these are not to be named in comparison with
<pb id="adams9" n="9"/>
this extinction of the proper consciousness of a human being,
with the degradation of a man into a brute.</p>
          <p>It may be said that the slave is used to his yoke; that his
sensibilities are blunted; and that he receives, without a pang or
a thought, the treatment which would sting other men to
madness. And to what does this apology amount? It virtually
declares that slavery has done its perfect work—has quenched the
spirit of humanity—that the Man is dead within the Slave. It is
not, however, true that this work of abasement is ever so
effectually done as to extinguish all feeling. Man is too great a
creature to be wholly ruined by Man. When he seems dead he
only sleeps. There are occasionally some sullen murmurs in the
calm of slavery, showing that life still beats in the soul, that the
idea of rights cannot be wholly effaced from the human being. It
would be too painful, and it is not needed, to detail the process
by which the spirit is broken in slavery. I refer to one only, the
selling of slaves. The practice of exposing fellow-creatures for
sale, of having markets for men as for cattle, of examining the
limbs and muscles of a man and woman as of a brute, of putting
human beings under the hammer of an auctioneer, and delivering
them, like any other article of merchandise, to the highest
bidder, all this is such an insult to our common nature, and so
infinitely degrading to the poor victim, that it is hard to
conceive of its existence except in a barbarous country. The
violation of his own rights to which he is inured from birth,
must throw confusion over his ideas of all human rights. He
cannot comprehend them; or, if he does, how can he respect
them, seeing them, as he does, perpetually trampled on in his
own person?”</p>
          <p>Other demoralizing, we had almost said demonizing,
influences, which the system of slavery calls into play, might
be dwelt upon, were they not of too dark and impure a character
to admit of more than a passing hint. Any properly constituted
and instructed mind must shrink with horror at even a distant
contemplation of those violations of virtue and decency, and
the best and holiest affections of humanity, which are of daily,
hourly occurrence in the slave states of America, if the
testimony of a “thousand witnesses” many of them favourable
to this accursed system, is to be believed.</p>
          <p>We may now quote a few remarks apropos to our subject, by
an authority of some weight in this country. In an article in
“Chambers' Edinburgh Journal,” on a work published some
years since in one of the slave states, the professed object of
which was to prove that Negroes are not human beings
<pb id="adams10" n="10"/>
in the full sense of the term, but a sort of intermediate
link between the larger of the ape tribe and the white
races of man, it is said in conclusion, “The answer to all
these arguments is, we think, not difficult. Supposing the
Negroes differ in all the alleged respects from the whites,
the difference we would say, is not such as to justify,
the whites in making a property of them, and treating
them with cruelty. But the Negroes are not, in reality,
beyond the pale of humanity, either physically or mentally,
Their external conformation is not greatly different from
that of whites. Their being the same mentally, is shewn
by the fact, that many Negroes have displayed intellectual
and moral features equal to those of whites of high endowment.
We might instance Carey, Jenkins, Cuffee, Gustavus
Vasa, Toussaint, and many others.</p>
          <p>If any one Negro has shewn a character identical with that of
the white race, the whole family must be the same, though in
general inferior. The inferiority is shewn to be not in kind, but in
degree; and it would be just as proper for the clever whites to
seize and enslave the stupid ones, as for the whites in general to
enslave the blacks in general. The blacks, moreover, have shewn
a capacity of improvement. They have shewn that, as in many
districts of even our island of Great Britain, many parts of mind
appear absent only when not brought out or called into exercise,
and that by education the dormant faculties can be awakened
and called into strength, if not in one generation, at least in the
course of several. The tendency slavery is to keep down, at nearly
the level of brutes, beings who might be brightened into intellectual
and moral beauty.”</p>
          <p>Further, in their “Tract on Intelligent Negroes,” the
Messrs. Chambers either give utterance, or the sanction of their
names, to this sentiment—“Such men as Jenkins and Carey at
once close the months of those who, from ignorance or
something worse, allege an absolute difference, or specific
character, between the two races, and justify the consignment
of the black to a fate which only proves the lingering
barbarism of the white.”</p>
          <p>Yes, we are all stones from one quarry, dark of hue and rugged
of form as some may be, while others are white and
beautifully polished; coloured and shapen in accordance with
the will of the Divine Architect, we shall form eventually one
grand and symmetrical whole—a temple that shall redound to the
glory of Him who designed and fashioned it. What,
<pb id="adams11" n="11"/>
then; shall the richly sculptured capital of the slender column, or
the embossed key-stone of the stately arch, despise the dark
and rugged mass which helps to form the basement? nay, not
so; for it performs an important work in the economy of
the whole structure, and might by labour and skill have been
rendered worthy a place in its more ornamental parts. But
dropping the metaphor, truly may we say to the Negro—
<q direct="unspecified"><lg><l>“Bone of our bone, flesh of our flesh, thou art,</l><l>Co-heritor of kindred being thou;</l><l>From the full tide that warmed one mother's heart,</l><l>Thy veins and ours received the genial flow.”</l></lg></q></p>
          <p>It is plain, from the accounts which travellers give us, that
the great varieties, or races, into which ethnologists have divided
the human family, are not by any means so distinctly marked as
they would have us believe. The main distinctions of these races
are their geographical boundaries, for they melt, and, as it were,
run into each other in almost imperceptible gradations: and but for
the mountains, and seas, and rivers, which divide them, there would
be really no clear lines of demarcation. The woolly hair, protuberant
lips, and other physical characteristics, as they are generally considered,
of the Negro race, are not found in all of them, and one or other,
sometimes several of these characteristics, are found in other tribes.
There are Negroes which the most inveterate hater of a black skin could
not but acknowledge to be beautiful—perfect models of grace
and elegance; and there are white men, aye, men of the great
dominant Anglo-saxon race whose appearance would indicate a
very near approach to the lower grade of animals. That the structural
anatomy of all races closely approximates, even Dr. Knox admits,
for he says—“Strip off the outer garments of Venus, and compare her
to a bushwoman, (one of the most degraded of the African tribes,) and the
difference would be seen to be very slight.” These distinctions of race
then, on which so much stress is laid, are not organic, but merely
superficial, and therefore, as we must believe, variable according to
climate and circumstances.</p>
          <p>Wilson Armistead, whose volume contains a vast amount
of information on this head, tells us that “Professor Blumenbach,
the great German physiologist, bestowed much labour 
and research on the question of Negro capacity. He collected a
large number of skulls, and also a numerous library of 
the works of persons of African blood or descent, (which
<pb id="adams12" n="12"/>
library it is said would bear out the assertion, that there
is not a single department of taste or science, in which
some Negro has not distinguished himself.) Blumenbach is
perhaps, the greatest authority, in favour of the identity of
species, and of intellect in the black and white
races. It is to him that we are indebted for the most
complete body of information on this subject, which he
illustrated most successfully by his unrivalled collection of
the Craniæ of different nations, from all parts of the globe.</p>
          <p>From the results of the observations of Blumenbach and
others, it appears then, that there is no characteristic whatever
in the organization of the skull or brain of the Negro,
which affords a presumption of inferior endowment, either
of the intellectual of moral faculties. If it be asserted that
the African nations are inferior to the rest of mankind, from
historical facts, because they may be thought not to have
contributed their share to the advancement of human arts
and sciences, the Mandingoes may be instanced as a people
evidently susceptible of high mental culture and civilization.
They have not, indeed, contributed much towards the
advancement of human arts and sciences, but they have evinced
themselves willing and able to profit by these advantages,
when introduced among them.”And what more could the so-
called superior races have done? <hi rend="italics">They</hi> have availed themselves
of the means and opportunities of improvement offered to
them, and become elevated above the dark region of ignorance
and superstition, in which the poor Negro yet lies
grovelling; let them lend him a helping hand and lift him up
to the same height of civilization and knowledge as
that on which they now stand, and which he is as capable
of occupying and enjoying as themselves.</p>
          <p>Who can tell what a bright and glorious future may yet
be in store for this now degraded and persecuted race; how
high a position they may yet attain in the scale of humanity.
In the revolutions of past ages, what nations and
races have arisen from a state of barbarism, grown great
and flourished for awhile, and then declined; and it may
be that we ourselves have reached, and passed, our culminating
point of power and earthly glory; and that when we are
far down the descent which leads to extinction, or subjugation,
the dark-skinned dwellers in that far western continent, may
be great, and powerful, and famous; lifting aloft the lamp
of christianity—“That light which lighteneth every one
that cometh into the world;”cherishing the arts and
sciences which can no longer find a place in our deserted
<pb id="adams13" n="13"/>
schools and halls of learning; and, enriched by that commerce
which once crowded our ports with shipping, and filled our
marts to overflowing. Who can say what God in His
inscrutable wisdom, hath in store for this Negro race. We can
scarcely imagine that beneath the depth in which they now lie
bound, hand and foot, there is a lower deep still for them; the
light of knowledge and civilization, and above all, of
christianity, must reach their benighted souls; with knowledge
will come power, with power freedom; it is, it must be so
ordained. Let us then be fellow-workers with God, whose
image we recognise in this black brother of ours, crying out for
help amid the embers of his burning kraal, in the desolate
karoo, across which he journeys, faint and bleeding; on the
wide waters of the intermediate passage, nearly stifled in the
hold of the pestiferous slave ship; and in that boasted land of
liberty, where the true dignity of man is so much talked about,
but so little understood, and where independence would
appear to mean a total disregard of all the claims and rights of
human brotherhood! Listen, oh, listen, with pity and sympathy, to</p>

our readers—What can I do in this matter? how can I forward the
work of Negro emancipation? To such we say, watch and seek
for opportunities of rendering your aid, and they will certainly come;
until they do, let the following forcible words of that gifted woman,
Harriet Beecher Stowe, be ever before you:—“There is one thing
that every individual can do —that they can see to it that they
feel right. An atmosphere of sympathetic influence encircles
every human being, and the man or woman who feels
strongly, healthily, and justly, on the great interests of humanity,
is a constant benefactor to the human race. See, then, to your
sympathies on this matter! Are they in harmony with the
sympathies of Christ? or are they swayed and perverted by the
sophistries of worldly policy? Let, too, the good sentiment
embodied in these lines by Pollok, be borne in memory as a

          <head>CHAPTER II.—BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES.</head>
          <head>TOUSSAINT L'OVERTURE.</head>
          <p>WE need look no farther for a contradiction of the alleged
inferiority of the Negro race, than the subject of this sketch.
Here was a man—a true “image of God 
cut in ebony”—black, and all 
black; with no drop of other than African
blood flowing in his veins; but one generation removed from
the wild and savage state of an unreclaimed son of the
forest and the desert; a man, too, who passed the first fifty
years of his life in a state of slavery, which, although of a
mild form, admitted of but few means and opportunities of
mental improvement; and yet, by the mere force of the
moral and intellectual powers within him, he achieved a
greatness, little, if at all inferior to that of any white-skinned
warrior or legislator of his own, or any other age of
the world's history. If we were among those who would
set up the military hero as the highest type of human
excellence, we should probably find sufficient in the career
of this Toussaint L'Overture to justify our largest meed of
praise and admiration; he might indeed well be called the
“Napoleon of the Blacks,” only that his patriotism was purer,
his aims more noble and unselfish, his heart far less hard
and cruel, and his mind too benevolent and solicitous for
the good of his fellow-men, to allow of the fall and appropriate
application of such a title. Did we admit that the magnanimous
ruler, the framer and administrator of just and wholesome
laws, the calmer of unruly passions, the reconciler of
conflicting interests, and the reducer of chaotic elements
into harmonious and symmetrical order, were entitled to the
highest pinnacle of earthly glory and greatness, then might
we also claim for this erewhile chief of a black-skinned
community a lofty place in the estimation of the world. But
it is neither as the warrior nor to the legislator, great as
he undoubtedly was in both these capacities, that we look
upon Toussaint L'Overture with the greatest admiration.
Rather do we prefer to view him in his social and domestic
relations—as the attached and devoted servant, the tender
and affectionate husband and father, the faithful friend, the
strict observer of his promises and engagements, “the man
who never told a lie,” and scorned to act meanly or
<pb id="adams16" n="16"/>
disingenuously even to an enemy. These are the traits in his
character, we say, which it best pleases us to contemplate,
although they are not those, perhaps, which have contributed
most to exalt him in the eyes of the world at
 large—which have, by the blaze of his 
achievements, and the loud blast
of his renown, been attracted to that beautiful island of St.
Domingo, or Hayti, (the land of mountains,) as it was originally,
and is now again usually called—that island which has furnished us
with so striking an example of Negro capacity, both mental and
physical, and shown that the black man is not a whit inferior to
his fair-skinned brother, either in the qualities which win for him
the esteem and affection of all true hearts, or in those which are
generally allowed to constitute real greatness of character.</p>
          <p>Let us take a brief survey of the career of this extraordinary
man, and see if we can find it that which will establish his right to
the lofty position in which, by almost common consent, he has
been placed; he having been, as the “Biographie Universelle”
states, the model upon which, as Dictator and General, Napoleon
formed himself. We shall take up our hero's history at the very
earliest period of which a record can be found, in order to show
how little he was removed from the barbarous and savage state in
which the African tribes unhappily exist. Gaou Guinou, king of
one of the most powerful of these tribes, had a second son, who
was taken prisoner in war by a hostile people, and sold, as is
customary in these cases, to some white traffickers in human
merchandise. These civilized (?) and Christian (?) merchants
having a cargo of sable brothers and sisters to dispose of, brought
them to the shores of St. Domingo, into which island a large annual
importation of slaves was then taking place. The African prince was
purchased by the Count de Noé, a French proprietor of an extensive
plantation situated a few miles inland from Cape Francois. Here the
royal slave was kindly treated, and seems altogether to have led as
happy a life as one in a state of bondage could well do; he married
a maiden of his own colour and country—a fellow-slave on the same
plantation —and by her had eight children, of whom Toussaint,
born May 17th., 1743, was the eldest. To the parent, as nothing
very remarkable is recorded of him, we need make no further
allusion; it is to the illustrious son that our attention must now be
directed.</p>
          <p>Here, in this “Queen of the Antilles,” as Hayti has been
poetically called, beneath the balmy sky and amid the luxuriant
vegetation of the tropics, the Negro boy seems to
<pb id="adams17" n="17"/>
have grown up to manhood without experiencing any of those
hardships, and privations, and sufferings, to which the slave is
most commonly exposed. It appears to have been a point
of honour with most of the French proprietors of this island,
to treat their Negroes with kindness and consideration, and
hence they were held in more regard and affection than the
haughty Spaniards, who occupied, by a more ancient tenure of
possession, the larger portion of the island, and
looked upon these colonists from France with aversion and
distrust. Bayon de Libertas, the agent or manager for Toussaint's
master, who is called in some histories the Count de Breda, was
no exception to this rule, and verily he had his reward; for,
although in the sanguinary war of races or colours which by and by
deluged the beautiful island, his property was destroyed, yet was
his person and family protected, and conveyed beyond the reach
of danger, and the means furnished him, out of the wreck of the
property, to establish and maintain himself in a land of peace and
safety; and it was by Negro hands, obeying the promptings
of a warm, generous, and grateful heart, that this was effected.</p>
          <p>The weakly lad Toussaint, whose back had not been made to
bow beneath the burden, nor lacerated with stripes; whose little
strength had not been tasked beyond what it would
bear; but who had been allowed to lie about in the sunshine,
taking care of the cattle, and performing such light duties as best
suited him, had grown up then into a strong and
energetic man. Always thoughtful and serious beyond his years,
he had early attracted the attention of M. de Libertas,
who, as some authorities say, had him taught to read and write;
but this is unlikely; for, with all their affability and kindness to
their slaves, these French masters still looked upon them as an
inferior order of beings, on whom it would be useless, if not
dangerous, to bestow mental instruction. The most probable
account is that the young Toussaint gained such slight elementary
knowledge as he possessed from one Pierre Baptiste, a shrewd
and intelligent Negro on his master's estate, whose naturally
good abilities had been cultivated and improved by some
benevolent missionaries. Be this as it may, certain it is that
our hero did, during the season of his by no means heavy
bondage, snatch a few sprigs from the tree of knowledge; and
so rich was the soil of the mind in which he planted them, that
when he cast aside his shackles, came forth from his prison-house,
and stood before the world as the champion and director of his
lately enslaved, but now free brethren, all were
<pb id="adams18" n="18"/>
astonished at the abundance and maturity of the fruits there
displayed.</p>
          <p>The thoughtful and intelligent, though somewhat weakly Negro
youth, had, we say, grown up into a sturdy man. Sober,
honest, industrious, and religiously disposed, it was soon seen
that he was one in whom dependence might be placed; he was
first advanced to the office of coachman to M. de
Libertas, whose entire confidence he enjoyed; he was then
appointed to the responsible post of foreman of the sugar
works, and he now thought it well to choose for himself a wife,
in which choice he manifested his sense by
preferring to mere personal attractions, the qualities which
distinguish a good housewife and a faithful bosom friend.
Here is a beautiful picture which he once gave of conjugal
happiness and of simple earnest piety:—“We went to labour
in our fields with hand clasped in hand; we returned in
the same manner; scarcely did we feel the fatigues of the
day. Heaven bestowed a blessing on our toil; not only
we swam in abundance, but we had the pleasure of giving
provisions to Blacks who were in want. On the Sunday,
and on holidays, my wife, my relatives, and myself went to
church. Returning to our cottage, after an agreeable repast,
we spent the rest of the day in family intercourse, and we
terminated it by a prayer, in which we all joined.”</p>
          <p>Surely, amid the toils of state and harassing cares of his after
life, even in his hours of greatest triumph,—his scenes of
short-lived power and prosperity, this good man must have looked
back on such a picture, painted by memory, with a yearning regret,
even <sic corr="though">although</sic> he gazed from the broad sunshine of freedom into
the dark night of slavery; for that night to him had many
beautiful stars, that beamed down in placid loveliness, and shed
a mild radiance around his path, such as few behold who dwell
there. But it was duty which called him forth; in the first place
loyalty to the French King, whom he had never seen, nor was
ever likely to see, but whom he had been taught to consider as
the rightful claimant of his fealty and allegiance.
<q direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“True as the dial to the sun,</l><l>Although it be not shined upon,”</l></lg></q>
was that noble heart of his, even when his better judgment
was obscured, and his strong reason fettered, by the doctrine
of blind, unquestioning obedience to the powers that be, by
means of which, and the iron grasp of tyrranous rule, it is
<pb id="adams19" n="19"/>
alone possible to keep men in a state of slavery. Loyalty, we
say, at first to the King of France, caused Toussaint to assume
the upright attitude of a free man, and once in that position, it
was not long before the conviction, which his previous reading
had frequently suggested, flashed upon his mind, that freedom
was as much the right of himself and those of his own colour,
as it was of those fair-skinned declaimers about liberty and
equality, who, in setting forth their famous declaration, that
“All men are born and continue free and equal as to their
rights,” did not probably consider that the Negroes who were held in
bondage in the various French colonies, were entitled to the
benefit of its application. “<hi rend="italics">All </hi>men” did not include them,
because they were not men, being by nature placed below the
lowest in the scale of humanity. Not so, however, thought the
Negroes themselves; and when this declaration of the
assembled representatives of the French people, uttered amid
the bloody throes of a struggle for freedom such as the world
never saw before, was proclaimed in St. Domingo, Toussaint
felt that it was a grand truth, such as the human mind conceives
and utters only when stirred to its most profound depths by those
feelings and emotions which approach the nearest to
inspiration; and he felt, too, that it was not a truth, but a
specious and delusive fallacy, if it did not apply to himself, and
his sable brethren, and to every being to whom God had given
an immortal soul.</p>
          <p>Miss Martineau, in her fine historical romance, “The Hour
and the Man,”in which the character of Toussaint is no doubt
correctly drawn, gives this revelation of the state of his mind,
before the conviction, to which we have alluded, came like a
ray of morning, and flashed light into its inmost recesses. This
was soon after the breaking out of the Negro insurrection,
which, commencing in a plantation contiguous to that belonging
to Toussaint's master, had spread like wildfire through the
colony, and involved the whole property of the French
planters in one wide scene of ruin and devastation, amid which
many of the owners and their families perished. In this
insurrection Toussaint had refused to join, because he saw
nothing great or worthy in the motives which prompted the
rising of the slaves. He assisted his kind master to escape, and
to save as much of the property as could be borne off and
rendered available for future subsistence, and when he had
made every possible effort to mitigate the evils attendant on
the state of anarchy and lawless violence into which the French
settlements in St. Domingo were
<pb id="adams20" n="20"/>
plunged, and found that he could not stay the tide of revolution, he
withdrew, with such of the Negroes as chose to accompany
him, to the Spanish part of the island, and placed
himself and his followers under the command of the Spanish
general, who sided with the French royalists, and consequently, as
Toussaint then considered, had a claim to his service and
assistance.</p>
          <p>Alluding to the sons of our hero, who, with all the ardour
of youth, were commencing their course of military discipline,
Miss Martineau says, “The strong and busy years on which
they were entering had been all spent by him in acquiring
one habit of mind, to which his temperament and training
alike conduced—a habit of endurance. It was at this time
that he acquired the power of reading enough to seek for
books; and the books that he had got hold of were Epictetus,
and some fragments of Fenelon. With all the force of youth,
he had been by turns the stoic and the quietist; and while
busied in submitting himself to the pressure of the present,
he had turned from the past, and scarcely dreamed of
the future. If his imagination glanced back to the court
of the royal grandfather, held under the palm shades, or
pursuing the lion-hunt among the jungles of Africa, he had
hastily withdrawn his mind's eye from scenes which might
create impatience of his lot; and if he ever wondered whether
a long succession of ignorant and sensual Blacks were to be
driven into the field by the whip every day in St. Domingo, for
evermore, he had cut short the speculation as inconsistent with
his stoical habit of endurance, and his Christian principle of trust.
It was not till his youth was past that he had learned anything of the
revolutions of the world—too late to bring them into his
speculations and his hopes. He had read from year to year of the
conquests of Alexander and of Caesar; he had studied the wars of
France, and drawn the plans of campaigns in the sand before his
door till he knew them by heart; but it had not occurred to him
that while empires were overthrown in Asia, and Europe was
traversed by powers which gave and took its territories, as he saw
the Negroes barter their cocoa nuts and plantains on Saturday
nights—while such things had happened in another hemisphere, it
had not occurred to him that change would ever happen to St.
Domingo. He had heard of earthquakes taking place at intervals of
hundreds of years, and he knew that the times of the hurricane
were not calculable; but, patient and still as was his own existence,
he had never thought whether there might not be a convulsion
<pb id="adams21" n="21"/>
of human affections, a whirlwind of human passions, preparing
under the grim order of society in the colony. If a master died,
his heir succeeded him: if the “force” of any plantation was by
any conjuncture of circumstances dispersed or removed, another
Negro company was on the shore, ready to re-people the slave-
quarter. The mutabilities of human life had seemed to him to be
appointed to the Whites—to be their privilege and their discipline;
while he doubted not that the eternal command of the Blacks was
to bear and forbear.”</p>
          <p>But then far across the waters came sounding that glorious
declaration of universal liberty, which was to Toussaint like a
voice from heaven proclaiming the freedom of his enslaved
brethren. He at once saw that his loyalty had mistaken its object,
and that in fighting against the republic, he had been but serving
the cause of oppression and despotism: henceforward his course
must be different. He resigned the high command which he held
under the Spanish general, and was about to retire to the obscurity
of private life, there to abide patiently until providence by
some unmistakeable sign should call him forth to the work of
establishing the full and entire freedom of his race; and for this
sign he had not to wait. The greater portion of the Negroes who
had acted with him as the allies of the Spaniards, also deserted the
royalist cause; others flocked to him from all quarters; and
Toussaint was proclaimed by common consent the General-in-
chief of these dusky forces—the emancipator of the Blacks. And it
soon became evident that a master mind was among them.
Neither the Mulattoes, a powerful body in the island, who had
refused to recognise the right to liberty of those whose skin was
but a few shades darker than their own; nor the Spaniards, who
then held possession of about two-thirds of the land, were able to
stand against the power of the Negroes, organized and directed by
this <hi rend="italics">Toussaint L' Overture,</hi> (the <hi rend="italics">man who made an opening every
where,</hi>) as the French republican general, after he gladly accepted his
alliance, admiringly called him.</p>
          <p>Soon, under the firm, judicious, and temperate rule of the
Negro chief, the island of St. Domingo began to assume an aspect
very different from what it had lately presented. The devastated
plantations, which had become overgrown with the rank
vegetation, and converted into perfect wildernesses, were again
brought under cultivation, on a system which ensured to the
cultivators, no longer toiling for the profit alone of exacting
masters, a sufficient remuneration for their labour, while it
rendered a considerable sum for the purposes of
<pb id="adams22" n="22"/>
government. The White and Mulatto planters were invited to
return and take possession of their estates, under certain
conditions of allegiance to the ruling powers, and of payment to
their <hi rend="italics">free</hi> labourers. Outrages were repressed, whether
committed by Blacks or Whites, and a feeling of peace and
security began to take the place of the universal terror and
distrust which had lately prevailed. Wherever his presence was
most required, there was the Negro chief, calm, yet energetic;
resolute, yet gentle and urbane. Of all plots and conspiracies he
seemed to be made aware by some mysterious intuition, and he
was in the midst of the plotters, sometimes alone and unarmed, to
subdue them by the dignity of his moral courage and mild
persuasion; sometimes with an overpowering force, to awe them
into submission.</p>
          <p>The French commissioner deemed it expedient to make
him Governor-general of the island, of which he was in fact King,
long ere he had thrown off the yoke of France, and declared his
independence of all foreign power. Spain retired from the contest
with him, and gave up the possession of that large portion of the
island which she had held ever since its first discovery by
Columbus. The British, who had for some time maintained a
footing there, were also obliged to evacuate their posts, and leave
him undisputed master of the fortifications. An anecdote, which
exhibits the character of Toussaint in so honourable a light that
we cannot refrain from quoting it, is related in reference to this
period of his career. General Maitland, who commanded the
British forces, before he finally left the island, was desirous that
an interview should take place between himself and the Negro
chief, and for this purpose did not hesitate to visit his camp, and
thus place himself completely in the power of those with whom he had
lately been at mortal enmity. Nothing could show more strongly
a perfect confidence in Toussaint's integrity; which confidence
the event fully justified. The Black general had received from
Roumé, the French commissioner, a letter urging him to take this
opportunity of serving the government at home, by seizing the
person of the British officer, who, while on the way to the camp,
had some intimation of this. He proceeded, nevertheless, and having
reached Toussaint's quarters, had to wait some considerable time
before the Black chief appeared. When he did so, be bore in his hand
two letters, which he requested General Maitland to read. One was the
treacherous proposal from the commissioner, the other the answer to
it, just written, and containing an indignant refusal to act in so base a
manner. “I am” he
<pb id="adams23" n="23"/>
said in conclusion, “faithfully devoted to the republic, but will
not serve it at the expense of my conscience and my honour.”</p>
          <p>It was not long after this that he sent his two sons, Isaac and
Placide, to France, that they might be there educated under the
eye of the Directory, and serve as hostages for his good faith and
fidelity; and what a return he met with for his misplaced
confidence! Every means were taken to attach these youths to the
interests of France, and when Buonaparte, urged, partly by the
misrepresentations of the enemies of Toussaint and the Blacks,
who had been obliged to leave St. Domingo, and partly, it seems
more than probable, by jealousy of a growing greatness that might
one day overshadow his own, determined on sending an expedition
against the island, these sons of the Negro chief were sent with it,
as instruments to be used in any way that might best conduce to
the overthrow of their father's power and influence. Twenty-five
thousand men, the flower of the French army, were embarked on
board this squadron, of more than fifty sail, and the leader of the
expedition, Le Clerc, seems to have been fettered by no just
feelings, nor honourable scruples, in his dealings and <sic corr="negotiations">negociations</sic>
with the ruling powers of the colony. He had proclamations for the
people, full of fine-sounding words which meant nothing, and false
representations of the good intentions of the home government
towards the colony and the Negroes, for the generals to whom
Toussaint had entrusted the defence of the various divisions of the
island, some of whom were induced to betray the trust reposed in
them, and to join their forces with those of the invaders; and, as a
last resource, he had well-trained Cuba blood-hounds, which he did
not fail to use when opportunity offered, for hunting down such of
the Negroes as could neither be threatened nor cajoled into a
desertion of the cause of freedom.</p>
          <p>The first sight of the formidable French fleet assured
Toussaint of the determination of Buonaparte to crush or
subdue himself and his adherents, and bitter indeed was the
disappointment to his noble heart, to find that one on whom
he had looked as the champion of liberty—whose meteor-like
career he had watched with intense admiration, and to whom
he had repeatedly sent fraternal greetings and proffers of
service and devotion—that he, above all others, should put
forth his powerful arm to dash to the earth the cup of
liberty, of which the long oppressed African had just begun
to taste. This, we say, was a sore blow to Toussaint; yet
<pb id="adams24" n="24"/>
was he neither daunted by it, nor urged, by the menacing aspect
of this new danger, into any acts of rashness or cruelty towards
the Whites in the island. His strict injunction to his
emancipated countrymen had ever been “No retaliation for
former wrongs and sufferings,” and his severest punishments
had fallen upon those of his followers who disregarded this
command. He had his own nephew, a promising young officer,
shot, for no other fault than a show of lenity towards some
Negro rioters, who, in the district under his command, had risen
to revenge their old grudges against their cruel masters; and
there is no doubt that he greatly weakened his influence with
the Black leaders, by his mild and merciful bearing towards the
Whites and Mulattoes. And this was the man whom Le Clerc,
after he had in vain endeavoured by all the arts of diplomacy to
deceive or intimidate, proclaimed an outlaw; obliging him to take
refuge, with his family, among the mountain-fastnesses of the
island, where, surrounded by devoted friends and followers, he
might have set at defiance the whole power of the French army,
until the climate, which was making fearful ravages among
them, had wrought for him the work of deliverance.</p>
          <p>After the war had been carried on for some time with great
loss to the French, a truce was proffered by Le Clerc, which
Toussaint, grieved to the heart at the miseries and ravages of
war, gladly accepted. This led to a pretended treaty, by which
the Negro chief was assured of the continuance of his
governorship of the island, and the retention of their respective
ranks to all the officers of his army. Le Clerc was to act simply
as the French deputy, and to take such a share in the regulation
of affairs as the former representatives of the mother country
had been accustomed to do. L'Overture was to retire for awhile
to one of his country seats, and seek that repose which he so
much needed. This treaty was the cause of great rejoicing
throughout the island; the Blacks and the Whites mingled
together amicably; all set about repairing the ravages of war;
smiles were on every face, and hope in every heart, except
those which harboured treachery, and knew that the treaty was
all a delusion. Having thus lulled to sleep the vigilance of
Toussaint and his devoted friends, the French set about contriving
how they might entrap the mighty African, whom they dared
not seize openly, and take him, as the First Consul had
commanded, a prisoner to France. Nothing more infamous
than this order, and his whole treatment of Toussaint
L'Overture, is recorded of Napoleon, dark and bloody as
<pb id="adams25" n="25"/>
are the spots upon the escutcheon of his glory, and his
brother-in-law, Le Clerc, was a fit instrument for the carrying
out of his nefarious design. With the oath on his lips—“I swear
before the Supreme Being to respect the liberty of the people
of St. Domingo”—with which he had concluded the treaty, he
was plotting in his heart how best to compass the overthrow
of the man by whom that liberty had been achieved, and in whom
the coloured population of the island, numbering at least nine-tenths
of the whole, trusted for its continuance. He instructed
General Brunet , one of his officers, to overcharge one of the
divisions, or cantonments of the island with troops; this, as
was expected, called forth a remonstrance from the inhabitants,
and Toussaint was invited from his secure retreat to meet the
French general, and arrange the affair in a manner satisfactory
to all parties. Generously confiding in the professions of his
pretended friends, he came to the spot indicated with the
specified number of attendants, and while the conference was
in progress, was surrounded by a superior force, led on by an
Admiral of France—no doubt “an honourable 
man”—and he and
all the members of his family that could be readily laid hands
on, were made prisoners, and hurried on board a ship of war,
which instantly set sail, and conveyed him from the shores of
that beautiful island on which he had hoped to show to the
world how peaceful, how orderly, how great and prosperous,
might become a commonwealth of Negroes, properly governed
and instructed.</p>
          <p>Before we lose sight of St. Domingo altogether, and
accompany the unhappy Toussaint to his bleak prison and
grave among the Jura Mountains, in the land of everlasting
snow, let us put together a few of the most important dates
which stand as mile-stones on the road of his extraordinary
career. His birth we have already said occurred in the year
1743, so that at the breaking out of the first insurrection of the
Blacks, in August, 1791, he had reached the ripe age of forty-
eight years. At the end of 1793, when the British made an
attempt to obtain a footing on the island, we find him occupying
a leading rank in the Negro forces, and beginning to exercise
that influence over his countrymen which he afterwards
employed to such good purpose. The Blacks were then, with few
exceptions, anti-republican, although they for awhile held aloof
from either of the two parties, which here waged almost as fierce
contention, as that which was going on between royalty and
and republicanism in the mother country. The royalist tendencies
<pb id="adams26" n="26"/>
of the Negroes may perhaps be accounted for by the fact, that
the great body of the French planters, against whom they had
revolted, were declared democrats.</p>
          <p>It may assist us somewhat in forming a right estimate of
Toussaint's mental capacity, if we contemplate for a moment
the discordant elements which he was presently to reduce
to order and subjection. The state of parties—the conflict
of interests and opinions—in St. Domingo was most strange
and unprecedented. There were the Spaniards, looking upon
themselves as, by right of discovery and antiquity of possession,
the only true lords of the soil, with their proud chivalrous
notions of “the right divine of Kings,” and their haughty
contempt of the people and institutions of to-day; these, of
course, were royalists to the back-bone. There were the
French planters, who sang revolutionary songs, and shouted
“Liberty and equality! Down with tyranny!” and all that
sort of thing, who yet had been in their time, and would
fain be again, the greatest tyrants breathing; who were
bitterly incensed against the Blacks for attempting to carry
out the doctrines which they preached, and were watching
their opportunity to bring them again under the yoke of
bondage, and take a terrible vengeance for the losses and
indignities which they had suffered in the late revolt, against
what they called, and perhaps considered, “God-constituted
authority”—this impious seizure of liberty, and presumptious
assertion of equality. There were the Mulattoes, a mixed
breed of every shade of blackness, both in heart and countenance;
denied by the Whites the rights of citizenship, and hating
them; the holders of considerable property, and
therefore powerful in the island, for evil if not for good.
These free men looked down upon the lately enslaved Negroes
as something infinitely lower than themselves in the scale
of humanity, treated them with contempt, and, when opportunity
served, with cruelty; they injured and therefore hated
them, and were heartily hated in return. There were the
English, who are pretty sure to be found in troubled waters
all over the world, adding to the confusion worse confounded
by the thunder of their cannon and the rattle of their
musquetry; they, of course, were Bourbonites, although they
did not side with the Spaniards, who looked on their intrusion
with jealousy, nor indeed with any other considerable party
on the island, of which they had been urged to take possession
by some of the French royalists, who had fled for refuge to
Jamaica and other of our West India dependencies; and
so they had come, although with a force miserably deficient,
<pb id="adams27" n="27"/>
to see what sort of a chance they had. And last, though far from
least, there were the Negroes, numbering about five hundred
thousand, in all the delirium of newly acquired freedom, ignorant
and rude, as men must be in a state of slavery, with their hatreds
and animosities, the growth of generations of wrong and
suffering, liable to be led or provoked into the commission of all
sorts of follies and crimes. “It was at this moment,” says an
authority that we have consulted with much pleasure and
advantage,<ref id="ref6" n="6" rend="sc" target="note6" targOrder="U">* </ref> “of utter confusion and disorganization, when
British, French, Mulattoes, and Blacks were all acting their
respective parts in the turmoil, and all inextricably intermingle in
a bewildering war, which was neither a foreign war, nor a civil
war, nor a war of races, but a composition of all three—
it was at this moment that Toussaint L'Overture appeared, the
spirit and ruler of the storm.”</p>
          <p>Early in 1794, intelligence of the decree of the convention,
confirming the abolition of Negro slavery throughout the French
colonies, reached St. Domingo, and opened the eyes of
Toussaint, who was then a lieutenant-general under the
Spanish commander, to whom he had rendered signal service;
having attacked and taken many strong posts held by the
republican forces, and given occasion, by his activity and
success, to the memorable saying of the French commissioner
Polverel, <hi rend="italics">Cet homme fait overture purtout</hi>—That man makes an
opening every where—and adopted the name given him by
common consent of Toussaint L'Overture. In 1795, occurred
an insurrection of Mulattoes at the town of Cape Francois,
the head-quarters of the French general Laveaux, who was
seized and imprisoned by the insurgents. This afforded the
Negro chief an opportunity of proving his devotion to the
republic, to which he had but recently sent in his adhesion. He
marched at the head of ten thousand Blacks to the city, then
held by the Mulattoes, whom he reduced to submission, thus
rescuing the French general from his perilous position, and
reinstating him in his command of the colony, of which the
Negro chief was soon after made Lieutenant-governor by
Laveaux, who was not slow to discover and acknowledge his
extraordinary capacity. “It is this Black,” said he, “this
Sparticus predicted by Raynal, who is destined to avenge the
wrongs done to his race;” to which saying we may as well here
add the admission made by another French general, Lacroix,
<note id="note6" n="6" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref6">*  <hi rend="italics">Vide</hi> “Chambers's Useful and Entertaining Tracts,” No. 57.</note>
<pb id="adams28" n="28"/>
who wrote an account of the Revolution in the island, in terms
by no means favourable to the Negroes—“It must be allowed
that if St. Domingo still carried the colours of France, it was
solely owing to an old Negro, who seemed to bear a
commission from heaven to unite its dilacerated members.” In
1795, a new commission arrived from the mother country, and
Toussaint was loaded with compliments and expressions of
obligation for his services; and in 1796, Laveaux being obliged
to return to France, the Black general was made Commander-in-
chief of the French forces; thus the whole authority of the
colony, civil and military, was placed in his hands.</p>
          <p>For the next five years we find Toussaint managing, with
singular ability and address, the discordant elements submitted
to his control. A French biographer states, that “he laid the
foundation of a new state with the foresight of a mind that could
discover what would decay, and what would endure. St.
Domingo rose from its ashes; the right of law and justice was
established; those who had been slaves were now citizens.
Religion again reared her altars; and on the sites of ruins were
built new edifices.” Whether the idea of a separation from the
mother country was entertained by Toussaint during this
period, we cannot say; for one so devoted to the interests of his
race, and so well able to guide and govern them, it was very
natural to conceive a wish, at least, to found an independent
kingdom, where the full power and capacity of the Negro
character, in a state of freedom and enlightenment, might be
developed. We do not find, however, that he gave expression to
such a wish, although he acted with perfect independence
towards the French commissioners, and even sent some of
them, who interfered mischievously with his government of the
island, back to France, but thither also he sent his two eldest
sons to be educated, and that did not look as if he entertained
any designs of a rupture with the mother country. In 1801,
however, rumours reached the colony that Buonaparte, who
had never condescended to answer, except by vague messages,
the several letters which Toussaint had addressed to him,
contemplated the re-establishment of slavery in St. Domingo;
and then we have the first hint of an independent government.
An assembly of representatives from all parts of the island was
convened, and the draft of a constitution carefully drawn up
and presented to them, by which the whole executive civil
power, and the command of the forces, was to be placed in the
hands of a governor-general. Toussaint
<pb id="adams29" n="29"/>
was to hold this office for life, and to nominate the first of his
successors, whose term of rule was to be limited to five years.
This constitution, which gave to St. Domingo a virtual
independence, under the guardianship of France, was
proclaimed on the 1st. of May, in the above year.</p>
          <p>It was perhaps the news of this movement in the direction
of freedom, which at once determined Napoleon to crush the
power which might one day interfere with his ambitious designs.
He had just concluded a treaty of peace with England, and
having, as he told his minister Forfait, who remonstrated
with him on the projected invasion of St. Domingo, sixty
thousand troops that he wanted to get rid of, as they would
be troublesome to him at home, he fitted out this expedition
of ships, on board which there embarked, in addition
to the fighting men, his sister Pauline, the wife of Le Clerc,
the commander, and a great number of French noblemen
and gentlemen, with their ladies, to share the rich spoils
which they expected to take, and to revel in the glories
and delights of a tropical clime. How many of them
found a grave amid the sands and swamps of the island,
carried off by the fever and the pestilence which at certain
seasons prevail, it is not necessary for us to say. Of the
troops, although repeatedly reinforced, but a wretched
remnant returned to tell the tale of their discomfiture. The
treacherous seizure of Toussaint and his family, exasperated
the Negroes to a pitch of phrenzy; such of them as had been
deceived into a coalition with the French, at once saw
their error, and turned against them. There was no longer
truce, but war to the knife; unheard of cruelties were
perpetrated on both sides; and the struggle terminated in the
total defeat of the French, and the proclamation of the
independence of St. Domingo, or Hayti, the original name of
the island.</p>
          <p>And what became of Toussaint L'Overture, whom we left
heavily ironed, and confined in a cabin, apart from his family,
on board the French man-of-war? When he arrived in the
harbour of Brest, a few moments only were allowed him to
say farewell for ever to his wife and children. According
to some accounts he was first taken to Paris, and confined in
the prison of the Temple, and there meanly persecuted
by inquiries about much treasure, which it was supposed he
had buried in St. Domingo. Finding that he would
not, or, as it really appears, could not, make any revelations
on this head, Napoleon had him conveyed with great secrecy to
a solitary fortress in the Jura Mountains, where, after
<pb id="adams30" n="30"/>
an imprisonment of ten months, in a miserable dungeon, whose
stone walls and roof were glassy and beaded with moisture, the
strong constitution of this child of the tropics yielded to the
wasting influences of cold, hunger, and confinement; and he
died, as surely, and more cruelly murdered, than if he had been
shot, or hanged, like the vilest criminal.</p>
          <p>In the “Quarterly Review,” No. 42., will be found an able and
elaborate article on “The Past and Present Condition of Hayti,”
in which full justice is done to the character of Toussaint, as
well as to that of Henri Christophe and others associated with
him in the work of delivering his race from bondage. This
Christophe himself afforded a remarkable instance of Negro
capacity, as did Dessalines, who shared with him for awhile the
government of Hayti; but the good qualities of the latter were
obscured by his sanguinary disposition, and intense hatred of the
Whites. Of Toussaint's family nothing more is known than that they
remained in France; his younger son died of decline soon after
his father, and his wife in 1816; the second son, Isaac, wrote a
brief memoir of Toussaint, which appeared in 1825.</p>
          <p>A fine sonnet, penned by Wordsworth about the time of
Toussaint's disappearance, will serve to show how his lot was
regarded by the thoughtful and generous spirits of the period:—</p>
          <lg>
            <l>“Toussaint, the most unhappy Man of Men!</l>
            <l>Whether the whistling rustic tend his plough</l>
            <l>Within thy hearing, or thy head be now</l>
            <l>Pillowed in some deep dungeon's earless den:—</l>
            <l>O miserable chieftain! where and when</l>
            <l>Wilt thou find patience? Yet die not; do thou</l>
            <l>Wear rather in thy bonds a cheerful brow:</l>
            <l>Though fallen thyself, never to rise again,</l>
            <l>Live, and take comfort. Thou hast left behind</l>
            <l>Powers that will work for thee—air, earth, and skies;</l>
            <l>There's not a breathing of the common wind</l>
            <l>That will forget thee—thou hast great allies;</l>
            <l>Thy friends are exaltations, agonies,</l>
            <l>And love, and Man's unconquerable mind.”</l>

            <head>JAN TZATZOE, ANDREAS STOFFLES, ETC.</head>
            <p>THE two individuals whose names are here associated,
accompanied Dr. Philip, superintendent of the London
Missionary Society in South Africa, when, in the spring, of 1836,
he returned to England to testify, before a committee of the
House of Commons, to the injuries inflicted on the Aborigines
of the Cape by the Dutch and English settlers. The manner in
which these intelligent men conducted themselves, and gave
their evidence, which they were several times called on to do,
before the committee, convinced all who saw and heard them,
that the tribe or nation to which they belonged, however sunk
and degraded by ignorance and superstition, wanted only the
advantages of instruction, to enable them to bear a comparison
with any people, however powerful and enlightened.</p>
            <p>From an article in the “Christian Keepsake,” we learn that
Jan Tzatzoe was born in the year 1791, being the son of a
powerful chief, who held sway over a tribe of Amakosa Kaffirs,
whose territories bordered closely on those formerly
occupied by the Hottentots. The elder Tzatzoe was nearly
related to Habaki, the grandfather of Gaika, and consequently
belonged to one of the most ancient of the reigning families
of the country; he appears to have been held in high estimation
by the other chiefs for his wisdom and integrity, and to have
preserved, in a remarkable manner, peace and good order
among his people, with whom he left the possessions of his
forefathers, and settled in a portion of the country called the
Zuirveld, principally occupied by the Dutch. Here he was
residing when the London Missionary Society established an
institution for the spiritual instruction of the natives at
Bethelsdorp, and into this the young Tzatzoe entered as a student.</p>
            <p>Wild and untutored as he was—a perfect child of the
wilderness—he yet evinced so much mildness. and docility of
disposition, was so patient of the restraints imposed upon him,
so attentive and tractable, that he soon won the affection
and regard of those entrusted with his education, and filled
them with high hopes of his future usefulness, which his after
career did not disappoint.</p>
            <pb id="adams32" n="32"/>
            <p>The venerable Dr. Vanderkemp, a true friend to the
Aborigines, who, in conjunction with the Rev. James Read,
conducted the affairs of the Missionary station, loved and
treated the African youth as his own child, and laboured
earnestly and successfully to instil into his mind those
principles of truth and justice, which are in accordance with the
precepts of the Gospel. At Bethelsdorp Tzatzoe acquired a
knowledge of the Dutch language, and other branches of
learning, calculated to fit him for governing and instructing
his own countrymen, and for intercourse with the colonists.
At the age of twenty-four it is believed that he experienced
that entire and decided change of mind and spirit, which is
the effect of divine grace, and the mark of true christianity;
and he immediately became possessed with a desire to bear
the tidings of salvation to those of his race and nation, who
were grovelling in the darkness and delusion of heathenism.
Hence he eagerly sought to improve his opportunities of
mental instruction, and, in order to increase his influence,
he turned his attention also to those mechanical arts most
likely to prove useful and acceptable to a rude and barbarous
people.</p>
            <p>Having married a pious female of the Hottentot nation, who
had long been connected with the institution at Bethelsdorp,
Tzatzoe accompanied that devoted servant of Christ, John
Williams, on a mission to the Kaffirs, and remained for awhile
engaged in the good work, in the neighbourhood of the
residence, or “great place,” of his relative Gaika, who was chief
of the tribes in the vicinity of the Kat River. With this chief,
Lord Charles Somerset, governor of the Cape Colony, when he
visited the frontier in 1817, entered into a treaty, on which
occasion Tzatzoe acted as interpreter. Soon after the death of
Williams, Tzatzoe returned to Bethelsdorp, and was appointed
by the people one of the local authorities for hearing
complaints, and adjusting the differences which arose between
the colonists and the natives. We are told that “his conduct in
discharging the duties of this office, which has ever been found
of great importance to the harmony and order of the settlement,
was distinguished by great shrewdness, and the most
scrupulous adherence to integrity and justice.”</p>
            <p>From 1817 to 1826 Tzatzoe assisted in the establishment of
various missionary stations among his countrymen, and the
missionaries Williams, Brownlee, Shaw, and others, have borne
testimony to his sound judgment, earnest zeal, sincere piety
and extensive usefulness. The last mission which he
<pb id="adams33" n="33"/>
assisted in establishing, was in the territories of his aged father,
who had long wished that the light of christianity might be
introduced among his people. At this station, on the Buffalo River,
Tzatzoe remained, acting as assistant missionary under John
Brownlee; his intimate knowledge of the manners and
superstitions of the people, and his practical acquaintance with
revealed truth, rendered him a most valuable auxiliary in the
work of enlightenment and conversion; he assisted in
translating the scriptures into his native tongue;
preached the Gospel, prayed exhorted, advised, and
comforted; and not only in spiritual matters did he exert his
beneficial influence, but in civil affairs also, both of his own
people, then governed by his elder brother, and of the
neighbouring tribes, was he frequently consulted, and
requested to decide and arbitrate on matters in dispute; and such
was the confidence inspired by his known integrity and
justice, that his awards were seldom or ever disputed. On
one occasion, it is said, that two Kaffirs appeared before him,
each claiming a colt which they led to the place, and each
affirming in support of his claim, that he had in his possession
the dam of the colt. After listening to their conflicting
statements, Tzatzoe desired that the mares might be brought,
and turned loose with the disputed property, which directly
repaired to one of them, and was recognised in so 
unmistakable a manner, as to decide question of
ownership at once. This anecdote reminds us the celebrated
judgment of Solomon, and affords, to say the least, a proof
that our hero possessed a mind of great shrewdness and
intelligence.</p>
            <p>On the breaking out of a disastrous war between the Kaffirs and
the colonists, Tzatzoe successfully exerted his influence with the
people of his tribe to prevent their uniting with other tribes, in an
invasion of the colony; and afterwards, when called on to assist
the colonial government, he came forth with four hundred
followers, and rendered such aid as lay in his power, until the
cessation of hostilities, when he returned again to his peaceful
home; but only to find it in the occupancy of his white allies,
who had taken possession of his house and lands, well stocked and
cultivated, by the assiduous labour of many years, whose fruits he
was thus deprived of, and compelled to commence a new settlement
in an uncultivated part of his own hereditary domains.</p>
            <p>This, and other flagrant injuries, inflicted on himself and
his countrymen, made a deep impression on Tzatzoe's mind, 
and feeling convinced that the home government could not
<pb n="34"/>
be aware of the maladministration of affairs in the colony, he
resolved on visiting the mother country, partly to endeavour to
obtain a restitution of his rightful property, and redress
for the wrongs of those who had similar causes of complaint
with himself; and partly to solicit such assistance, as would
enable him to carry out his plans for the moral and physical 
improvement of the South African tribes.</p>
            <p>This design he was enabled to put in execution in the
of 1836, when a select committee of the British House of
Commons was prosecuting an inquiry as to “What measures
ought to be adopted with regard to the native inhabitants of
countries where British settlements were made, and to the
neighbouring tribes, in order to secure to them the due
observance of justice, and the protection of their rights; to
promote the spread of civilization, and to lead them
to the peaceful, voluntary reception of the christian religion.”</p>
            <p>One of the answers given by Tzatzoe to the numerous
queries of the committee deserves to be recorded here, because
it shows what effect the reception of real, living christianity has
upon the mind, with regard to a much disputed question. When
asked why, in the war to which we have already alluded, he did
not take any part with his countrymen against the colony, he
replied, “In the first place I am a christian, and the scriptures
tell us not to fight, or to shed blood; and that is the first reason
why I remained quiet.”</p>
            <p>It would have been certainly better for the consistency of
Tzatzoe's christian character if he had remained in this mind;
then would not he, an occasional preacher of the gospel of
the Prince of Peace, have appeared before the committee,
and the British public, in a  military uniform, indicating his
rank of Field-cornet in the colonial service. This was surely a
strange anomaly!</p>
            <p>However, we can scarcely wonder that, when surrounded by
the provocations and incitements of war in his native land, the
Kaffir chief prevailed for once over the christian
missionary; it was perhaps impossible for him to keep his
people from joining in the war on one side or the other, and
therefore he led them to espouse the side which he considered
that of order and right. Whether he was justified in the sight of
God for taking arms on this occasion, we presume not to say;
but we cannot help observing that it does seem at variance with
his own acknowledgment of the plain teaching of the scriptures,
which he truly says “Tell us not to fight.”</p>
            <pb id="adams35" n="35"/>
            <p>However, let us pass on to observe, that his candid and and
straight-forward statements so convinced the British Parliament
of the truth of his complaints, that restitution to him and his
people was ordered to be made. “The Kaffir chief,” said the late
Edward Baines, Esq., M.P. for Leeds, “had given his evidence
with an artlessness and dignity which proved that he was indeed
a chief. There was that about his evidence which showed that
he had the interest of his nation at heart; that he came here
imbued with a truly noble spirit, and the desire of
communicating that spirit to others, and of teaching us how we
might make the Aborigines of Africa happy, instead of rendering
their country desolate. He had told that by doing justice to the
people of Africa, we should induce them to become our
customers and friends. In this way the African chief had
imparted knowledge to the British senate.”</p>
            <p>Tzatzoe, while in England, produced a most favourable
impression upon all who had an opportunity of becoming
acquainted with him. “Truly anxious to benefit his countrymen,”
as Wilson Armistead observes, “he took back to Africa,
not, as has been too often the case, arms and ammunition for
annihilating the human race, but implements of husbandry—the
axe and the spade, the pruning-hook and the plough—emblems of
peace! with a large supply of books, and all the <sic corr="apparatus">aparatus</sic> for
schools. He was welcomed with the most cordial affection by
the chiefs and people of his nation, who were in a state of
intense anxiety about his return; and he was followed by the
prayers and benedictions of all good men, who must feel a deep
interest in all that tends to the civilization of Africa, and the
accomplishment of the promise which declares that ‘Ethiopia
shall stretch forth her hands unto God!’ ”</p>
            <p>Of Tzatzoe's later career we have met with no distinct
record; in 1839 he was seen by Joseph Backhouse, a
Missionary of the Society of Friends, who, in his “Narrative
of a Visit to the Mauritius and South Africa,” mentions meeting
him at the chief's own house, when he says, “I was comforted,
while sitting a short time with him, in a very perceptible feeling
of the love of our Heavenly Father, uniting our hearts in Gospel
fellowship.”</p>
            <p>One of the Missionaries to Kaffirland, to whom he appears
to have been well known, tells us that “Tzatzoe possesses
considerable talent; his addresses are pointed and powerful, and
always command the attention of his hearers. As a preacher, his
perfect knowledge of the Kaffir character, and his acquaintance
with their customs, give him an advantage
<pb id="adams36" n="36"/>
which few Europeans can attain in preaching Kaffirs. But the
tact which he displays in combating Kaffir prejudices
and superstitions is really surprising. I have often listened
with delight and astonishment to his discourses, which
are so full, so simple, and yet so powerful. The ease,
too, with which he can effectually arrest the attention of his
countrymen is a matter of admiration. Here is a specimen
of the great power of God, in reclaiming a savage, and
making him an instrument in reclaiming others.”</p>
            <p>Thomas Pringle, in his “African Sketches,” has furnished
a picture of the home of Tzatzoe on the Buffalo River,
which our readers will perhaps be glad to look upon. It
will be remembered that this was the missionary station which
he assisted to establish at the request of his aged father,
and where, in conjunction with John Brownlee, he laboured
for the conversion of souls in his younger days.</p>

            <head>ANDREAS STOFFLES.</head>
            <p>BETWEEN the Gamtoos and the Great Fish River, in Southern
Africa, is situated a somewhat extensive tract of country, called
the Zuirveld; this was originally inhabited by Hottentots of the
Genah tribe, but is now chiefly in possession of the Dutch settlers,
who have dispossessed the natives, and given the country its
present name. Here, in or about the year 1776, was torn Andreas
Stoffles, of Hottentot parents; here he grew up in all the freedom
of a savage life—in all the degradation and ignorance of a heathen
state; hunted and fished, and fought with his Dutch and other foes; and
scrambled his way through the thorny paths of existence as best he
could, with no light to guide him, save that of a naturally sound judgment;
no power to sustain him, save the innate energy of an active mind
and a sanguine temperament. He had many perilous adventures, and two
or three narrow escapes of his life, and was at last made prisoner
by a marauding party of Kaffirs, and carried off into their own
territory. And in this event, it appears to us, that we may very
clearly trace the finger of Providence, directing a soul chosen for
Salvation into the way thereof.</p>
            <p>We have lately spoken of Bethelsdorp; in the year 1810,
there came to that fountain of truth, springing forth in
the wilderness of error, a Kaffir chief, or what purpose
we know not, but he brought with him, as interpreter, a
being arrayed like himself, in a dressed cow-skin, thrown
loosely over his shoulders, bearing the round shield and
pointed assagai, and having his body smeared with grease and
red ochre; altogether as unlikely looking a receptacle for the
light of Divine grace as one could well imagine. When he
first attended the celebration of God's worship, he thought
the people had assembled to receive rations, or presents of
beads and buttons, so ignorant was he of all which related
to spiritual matters. But there came a light to his benighted
soul—a gleam which penetrated into its inmost recesses, and
for awhile dazzled and confounded him. He became restless,
and unhappy. There was a weight upon his mind, and a
terror in his heart, for which he knew not how to account.
He returned to the Kaffirs, and shared in the dances, and
mirth, and idle merriment, and all the excitements of a life
of heathen barbarism, hoping by this means to shake off the
depression of his spirits, but in vain; a sense of conscious
guilt weighed him down. God was too merciful to let his
<pb id="adams38" n="38"/>
soul so escape to perdition, but twined around it, more and
more closely, the silken meshes of a Saviour's love; and after
two or three years of violent struggling, faith came, and
quietly smoothed its ruffled pinions, and healed its bruised
limbs, and gave it assurance of safety and everlasting peace.
And thus Andreas Stoffles became a true convert to the
christian religion. The wild Hottentot was changed into the
gentle, self-denying, peaceable follower of Him, who came to
seek and to save that which was lost. “Truly, this is the Lord's
doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.”</p>
            <p>“Turned from darkness to light, Stoffles,”we are told,
“believed himself called upon to testify of the grace of God
to those around him, manifesting the utmost anxiety for the
salvation of his fellow-men. His conversations, addresses,
and prayers, deeply impressed all who heard him. Often
were whole assemblies of natives and Europeans melted into
tears, when he spoke to them of the dying love of the
Saviour. This was the subject ever uppermost in his mind,
and on dwelling upon it, his flow of language was peculiar to
himself. His wife and many of his relatives became
converted.”<ref id="ref7" n="7" rend="sc" target="note7" targOrder="U">* </ref></p>
            <p>Stoffles appears to have remained awhile at the Bethelsdorp
Institution, and as Tzatzoe must have been also there at that
time, it is likely that they were fellow-students, drinking together
at the fountain of Divine truth, and enjoying the pleasures of
christian fellowship. We are told of Stoffles, that, “Some
time after his conversion, a magistrate residing at a
distance from Bethelsdorp, applied to the station for a few men
to assist in some public works. Stoffles volunteered to go;
but no sooner arrived in the locality, than he began to preach
to the Hottentots and slaves with great effect. There was much
weeping, and it was said that he would drive all the people
mad. He was forbidden to preach; but he continued to do so,
believing it right to obey God, and he was consequently
imprisoned. He now begun preaching to the prisoners, who
were numerous, with similar effect; so that the only alternative
was to release him, and send him back to Bethelsdorp. He even
considered it an honour to have been in bonds for Christ's
sake.”<ref id="ref8" n="8" rend="sc" target="note8" targOrder="U">†</ref></p>
            <p>This anecdote is very characteristic of the man—ardent,
energetic; ever seeking opportunities of proclaiming the great
mercy which he had himself experienced, and of drawing others
into the fold of salvation. Was there a missionary

<pb id="adams39" n="39"/>
station to be established far out in the wilds, where the
foot of a white man had scarcely ever penetrated, he was
ready to act as pioneer, not only into the pathless and stony
wilderness, but also into the hearts of the benighted savages
who dwelt there. He accompanied the Missionaries for
Lattakoo, through the country of the wild Bushmen, to their
place of destination, and remained with them for three or
four years, until they had familiarized themselves with the
habits and manners of the people around them, and obtained
a hold on their confidence and affection. He travelled with
the bringers of good tidings through the towns and villages,
of the Bechuanas. Campbell, in his second journey to
Kurachana, and Miles, through Kaffraria, to the country
of the Tambookies, had his good company and thoughtful
counsel; and Dr. Philips, in his journeyings hither and thither 
among the native tribes, was often cheered and encouraged
by the hopeful words and earnest prayers of the pious
Hottentot, who was as true a patriot, as he was a faithful
servant of Christ. Keenly alive to the degraded condition
of his countrymen, he lost no opportunity of endeavouring
to arouse and enlighten them; and when civil liberty was
proclaimed for the scattered Hottentots, and a tract of
country in the vicinity of Kat River was offered them by
the colonial government, where they might settle, and practice
the arts of peaceful industry, he was the first to go and take
possession of “the Hottentot's Land of Canaan,” as he loved
to call it; and for many years he devoted himself entirely
to the welfare and prosperity of the settlement, of the people
of which, and the several locations around, he came to be
regarded as the leader, the friend, and the adviser in all
matters, temporal as well as spiritual. Before any authorized
teacher of the Word came to that part of Africa, Stoffles,
with the assistance of other pious natives, conducted the
sabbath and week-day services with marked propriety and
decorum. He collected large and attentive audiences at his
prayer-meetings, and with his fervent addresses, moved many
a heart to repentance, and convinced many a mind of the
reasonableness, and the delightfulness, and the safety of
christianity. He promoted education, and from him, as from a
fountain, flowed forth religious instruction, beautifying and
refreshing the arid wilderness around.</p>
            <p>Such was Andreas Stoffles—a man of a dark skin and a
despised race; what Knox contemptuously describes as “a
simple, feeble race of men, living in little groups, almost indeed
in families, tending their fat-tailed sheep and dreaming away their
<pb id="adams40" n="40"/>
lives.”<ref id="ref9" n="9" rend="sc" target="note9" targOrder="U">* </ref> His was no life of a dreamer, at all events, but one of
ceaseless activity—fruitful in good works; and his name, although it
may not be inscribed in any earthly temple of fame, is assuredly
written in bright characters in the “Lamb's Book of Everlasting
Life.”</p>
            <p>One great object which Stoffles had in view in visiting England,
was to obtain a remission of the decree issued by the governor of
the colony, by which the Missionaries were denied the privilege of
returning to the Hottentot settlements on the Kat River, after
the termination of the war with the Kaffirs, which had obliged
them to leave the scene of their useful labours. Besides this, he
wished, as he said, “to see and become acquainted with the people
by whom the Gospel had been sent to their heathen land, and to
express his gratitude to them for the inestimable blessing.” Armistead says
that “Before the Aborigines Committee of the House of
Commons he stated the grievances of his afflicted countrymen,
and produced a strong impression, in favour of their claim and his
own. To the friends of missions, in various parts of the kingdom,
his animated and eloquent addresses, joined with his fervent,
unaffected piety, afforded the highest interest, and the most
hallowed delight.”</p>
            <p>On one occasion of a public meeting in Exeter Hall, London, in
addressing a crowded assembly on the effects of
the Gospel, he thus spake:—“I wish to tell you what the Bible has
done for Africa. When the Bible came amongst us we were naked;
we lived in caves and on the tops of the mountains; we had no
clothes, but painted our bodies. At first we were surprised to hear
the truths of the Bible, which charmed us out of the caves and
from the tops of the mountains; made us throw away all our old
customs and practices, and live among civilized men. We are
civilized now; we know there is a God. I have travelled with the
Missionaries in taking the Bible to the Bushmen, and other
nations. When the Word of God has been preached, the Bushman
has thrown away his bow and arrows. I have accompanied the
Bible to the Kaffir nation; and when the Bible spoke, the Kaffir
nation threw away its shield and all its vain customs. I went to
Lattakoo, and they forsook all their evil works; they threw away
their assagais; and became the children of God. The only way to
reconcile man to man, is to instruct him in the truths of the Bible.
I say, again, where the Bible comes, the minds of men are
<note id="note9" n="9" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref9">*  Vide “Knox on the Races of Men,” page 284.</note>
<pb id="adams41" n="41"/>
enlightened; where it is not, there is nothing but darkness.” What
nobler testimony than this to the influence of the Gospel, could
be borne by the most gifted and enlightened of men, however
fair might be his skin, however perfect, according to our ideas of
perfection, his physical conformation?</p>
            <p>The death of Stoffles, which occurred in 1837, immediately
after his return to Africa, was felt and mourned as a great
affliction, not only by his relatives, and those of his own
nation, but also by many of the Kaffirs and the colonists,
to whom his good qualities and active benevolence had
greatly endeared him. He died, quite calm and resigned, before
he could reach the Hottentot settlements, expressing
some regret that he “had not been spared to go and tell
his people what he had seen and heard in England. He would,
however, go and tell his story in heaven, although
he doubted not that they knew more than he could tell them
there.”</p>
            <lg type="verse">
              <l>So ends a christian's life; so sinks a sun,</l>
              <l>That hath its course beneficently run.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>In Stoffles and Tzatzoe, more properly, we believe, spelled
Tshâtshu, we have examples of great ability, united with
high moral worth; intellectual power was here, if not of
the highest order, yet, to say the least, very far removed
from the lowest; conscientiousness was here; integrity; love
of truth; devotedness to a good cause; and some of the
noblest gifts and qualities with which the Creator has
endowed the human mind; and yet these, too, were men of
the so-called inferior races, the one a Hottentot, the other
a Kaffir. Neither of them, it is true, were, strictly speaking,
Negroes, that term being more usually, and perhaps correctly,
applied to the natives of Central Africa. As, however, even
Knox admits that the Kaffirs, or Caffres, “are closely allied
to the Negro race, and probably graduate, as it were, into
them;“ and as, moreover, he includes both Kaffirs and
Hottentots in his category of the dark, and as he considers,
inferior races, we think that we are quite justified in
adducing these examples of coloured men with great and good
qualities, in refutation of the sweeping charge of positive
and unchangeable inferiority of nature. That the Kaffirs
are no despicable foes, recent events at the Cape have
sufficiently shown.</p>
            <p>We hear much of their treachery, cruelty, falsehood, and
disregard of all moral ties and obligations but it should be
remembered that they are yet in a state of barbarism, and
<pb id="adams42" n="42"/>
that wrong and oppression are not exactly the best teachers of
virtue and morality. Instances, however, might be cited of
generosity and magnanimity even among these savages, driven
and hunted as they are from the lands of their fathers, and
dispossessed of the means of subsistence, and of all which they
most love and cherish. Thus we are told that Capt.
Strockinstrom, who formed one of a commando or expedition
against Meekanna, a Kaffir chief, being taken ill while on the
march, and left behind unnoticed, observed a solitary native
approaching him armed with a bundle of arrows. The Captain,
who was too unwell to retreat or offer any resistance, expected
at once to be put to death: great therefore was his surprise to
see his foe, when he had approached very near to him, lay
down his mantle and arms, and dart off at full speed. In about
an hour he returned, and brought with him a Dutch settler
mounted, and leading a spare horse. Then resuming his arrows
and cow-skin, without waiting for thanks or reward, he
disappeared in the jungle. When the peace was concluded, Capt.
S. sought to discover his generous preserver, whom he knew to
be a Kaffir by unmistakable signs; but no one came forward to
claim the reward, which was publicly offered for the service
thus nobly rendered in a time of emergency.</p>
            <p>Knox says, and he has good authority for his assertion, that
it is only since their contest with Europeans, that the Kaffirs
have become “treacherous, bloody, and thoroughly savage;”
before that period, although rude and barbarous; wanting in all
the arts of civilization, they were “mild, and to a certain extent
trust-worthy.” It is humiliating to learn that such an effect
should have been produced upon the dark Aboriginal races, by
contact with white men—educated men—christian men! But so it
is, and so it ever will be while the sword is used to open a way
for the Bible. If the warrior and the missionary go hand in hand,
the latter preacheth and teacheth for the most part in vain;
some good he will do, but how little good, compared with what
he might do, if he went forth relying only upon the promises of
God, and the sure word of salvation. Those missions have ever been
the most successful which have been planted in the desert and
the wilderness, wherein no sword or bayonet has ever flashed,
no drop of human blood been spilled; those Missionaries the
most beloved, and the most influential for good, who have
leaned the least upon the arm of earthly power.—
“Their noblest epithet—the men of peace!”</p>
            <pb id="adams43" n="43"/>
            <p>It is love, and not fear, which must prepare the way for the
Gospel of Love. The foaming and impetuous cataract may
sweep away all before it, and open a channel through mountain
barriers for the fertilizing waters to flow; but it leaves wrecks
and rains, and rugged places, which long fret and retard the
progress of these waters of life. But the gentle streamlet glides
noiselessly into the and plain, and freshens and beautifies it
without raising a single obstacle to its calm and peaceful progress.
We know that God overrules even bad means, and makes
them subservient to a good end—here is a proof of his infinite
mercy!—but we cannot think, that he looks with pleasure upon
such violent means, as are too often used to open a way for the
introduction of the Gospel to a heathen people.</p>
            <p>But we were speaking of the Kaffirs, many of whom,
especially of those to whom the knowledge of salvation has
been imparted, have exhibited traits of character worthy of our
highest admiration. The wife of the devoted Missionary
Williams relates, that on the day before her husband's decease,
she asked one of the Kaffir converts if he had no wish to see his
teacher before his departure from this life, “Yes,” he replied,
“but I do not like to ask you, because I think it will make your
heart sore.”On being admitted to the side of the death-bed, he
was asked if he prayed, and what he prayed for; his reply was, “I
pray the Lord, as he hath brought us a teacher over the great sea,
and hath thus long spared him to tell us His Word, that he
would be pleased to raise him up again to tell us more of the
Great Word.” Mrs. Williams then said, “Do you pray for me?”
“Yes,” he replied. “And what,” she again questioned,
“do you ask when you pray for me? “I pray,”
continued the convert, “that if the Lord should take away
your husband from you, he would support and protect you
and your little ones in the midst of this wild and barbarous
people.” In relating this incident afterwards, Mrs. Williams
adds, “This was to me a precious sermon, at such a season,
from the mouth of a Kaffir.”</p>
            <p>Among the christian converts of South Africa, were several
who sealed their faith with their blood, and died like true
martyrs, glorifying God, and forgiving those who slew them.
Of this number were Jacob and Peter Lines; and Joannes Jaager,
who left his home on the Karree mountains, and came one
hundred miles to the nearest Missionary station, to hear the glad
tidings of the Gospel, in which he found a healing balm and a
peace which “passeth understanding.”
<pb id="adams44" n="44"/>
He and two other zealous converts to christianity, named
Joannes and Jacob Links, were cruelly murdered in the vicinity
of the Fish River, by the natives whom they had hoped to
instruct in the ways of salvation. A striking example of the
subduing and humanizing power of the Gospel is afforded in the
case of one Afrikaner, a Namacqua chief, of whom the Missionary
Campbell gives an account:—Previous to his conversion he was a
lawless and resolute robber, a terror to his country, so much dreaded
that a thousand dollars were offered to any one who could shoot him;
afterwards he became an ornament to the profession of christianity.
One of the fiercest spirits that ever trod the burning sands of Africa,
grew beneath the influence of redeeming mercy and grace, meek, and
humble, and teachable as a little child.</p>
            <p>If acuteness of intellect be an indication of great mental capacity, then
may the Kaffirs well lay claim to such. In the late wars and <sic corr="negotiations">negociations</sic>
with the colonial authorities, many of them have shewn themselves to be
the most subtle casuists that ever argued a point of logic, or twisted a
simple fact into all manner of shapes. Mrs. Ward, in her one-sided book,
called “The Cape and the Kaffirs,” gives some amusing instances of this.
It was a great mistake for Sir Harry Smith, when he assumed the
governorship of the colony, to play the farce that he did, declaring before
the assembled chiefs, with a vast deal of parade and theatrical bluster, that
he, the great<hi rend="italics"> Inkosi Enkulu</hi>—the representative of the Queen of England,
and so forth, would teach them who should henceforth be their master;
and if they failed to obey <hi rend="italics">his</hi> word, he would sweep the disobedient from
the land. They knew perfectly well the value of both his threats and promises,
and no doubt laughed within themselves at this foolish piece of bombast,
although all the while looking very grave and penitent. There was a great
deal of quiet irony, as well as cautious sagacity, in the reply of one of them
to the question of what he thought of the proceedings on that occasion:—
“The day was stormy, the wind blew strong.” The authoress of the above
work tells us that “One secret of Sir Harry Smith's success, (query, what
success?) is that he does not suffer the Kaffirs to parley with him. He looks
upon them as unworthy to be listened to, and they feel this; they make no
attempt to reply. As for reasoning with them, it were but lost time; they are
the cleverest logicians in the world, and have always an answer more
suitable to their purpose than we could possibly anticipate.”</p>
            <pb id="adams45" n="45"/>
            <p>Among the primitive races of Southern Africa, those to whom the Dutch
gave the name Bosjemen, or Bushmen, have generally been considered
the lowest in the scale of intelligence. These Know describes as “smaller
in stature that the Hottentots; less civilized, if such a term could possibly
be so used or misapplied; living without flocks or herds; employing the
bow and poisoned arrow; children of the desert.” Yet even from amid
these Troglodites—dwellers beneath rocks and in holes in the earth—
have come forth bright examples of moral goodness and intellectual
capacity, to vindicate their claim to a place among the improveable races
of mankind. We may adduce two or three of these examples, as given in
Dr. Philip's “African Researches” and quoted in Armistead's volume.
After stating his opinion that “the civilization of this degraded people
is not only practicable, but might be easily attained;” he says, “In a
journey undertaken into the interior of a colony in 1819, we had two
Bushmen in our train. One of them had been only a few months in the
service of our missionary when he joined us; and we had not in our
party anyone who was more teachable, faithful, and obliging.”</p>
            <p>Sir J. Brenton, Bart., in a letter dated November 24th., 1825, gives an
account of a Bosjemen boy brought by him to England from the Cape
of Good Hope, who “possessed the sweetest disposition and the strongest
attachments possible,” and who seems to have “attained a most
extraordinary degree of knowledge in religion.” “His memory,” says the
narrator, “is wonderful; he brings home every sermon he hears,
and comment upon it with extraordinary exactness.” Colonel Collins, in
his report to government in 1809, speaks of the Bushmen as being most
liberally gifted by nature with talents, and expresses his belief that “there
is not upon the face of the globe a people more possessed of better natural
abilities, or more susceptible of mental and moral improvement.” Much
additional testimony on this head might be produced were it desirable, but
we apprehend that the above will be sufficient for our present purpose. As
a fitting conclusion to this chapter, we append the following characteristic
sketches by Pringle:—</p>

          <head>TESTIMONY OF THE ABBE GREGOIRE.</head>
          <p>A PIOUS and enlightened Frenchman, named Grégoire,
well-known in the learned societies of his day, having been
Bishop of Blois, a member of the Conservative Senate, of the
National Institute, the Royal Society of Gottingen, etc.,
collected an immense mass of information, illustrative of the
moral qualities and intellectual capacities of Negroes, which
he published in a work entitled <foreign lang="fre">“De la Littérature
des Nègres, on Recherches sur leur Facultés Intellectuelles,
leur Qualités Morales, et leur Littréature.”</foreign> From this valuable
and interesting work, of which a translation by
Gerrit Smith has been published in America, is derived the
information contained in the present chapter: the particulars of
the several memoirs are more fully given in Armistead's
“Tribute for the Negro,” already several times referred to.</p>
          <div3 type="subchapter">
            <head>JOB BEN SOLLIMAN.</head>
            <p>THIS African was the son of the Mahomedan King of
Bunda, on the Gambia, who, in 1730, while travelling across
the countries of Zagra, with a servant and some cattle, was
seized and carried to Jour, and there sold to one Captain
Pyke, who brought him to America, and re-sold him to a
Maryland planter. With this master, who treated him with
unusual kindness, Solliman remained for about a year, when,
by a train of extraordinary circumstances, he was enabled to
leave America and come to England, where his perfect
knowledge of the Arabic tongue having become known to
Sir Hans Sloane, he was employed in translating manuscripts,
inscriptions on coins, medals, etc. He seems to have acquired
English during his short servitude and his passage
across the Atlantic, and to have been altogether a man of great
mental capacity. Being recommended by Sir Hans to the Duke
of Montague, that nobleman was so pleased with the
sweetness of his temper and disposition, the dignified
ease of his manners, and his evident genius and ability that he
introduced him at court, where he was graciously
<pb id="adams48" n="48"/>
received by the royal family and many of the nobility, who
bestowed upon him distinguished marks of favour. After
remaining in this country for about eighteen months, Solliman
was very desirous of returning to his native land, to see his father,
the King of Bunda, once more.</p>
            <p>Many presents and marks of esteem were given to him by
Queen Caroline, the Dukes of Northumberland and Montague,
and other nobles and ladies of the court, as well as by the
African Company, whose agents were ordered to show him
great, respect, and afford him all facilities for his return to
Bunda. He reached his home in safety, and his restoration from
the bondage of the white man was thought a wonderful event.
“During sixty years,” said one of his uncles, embracing him, “thou
art the first slave I have ever seen return from America.” Many letters
were written by Solliman to his friends both in Europe and the
American colony, and thus the interest in him was kept alive: at
his father's death he became King, and seems to have been much
beloved by his subjects. He was remarkable for a most retentive
memory. Grégoire states that he knew the Koran by heart, and
his assertion is borne out by the fact, that, while in England, he
wrote in Arabic a copy of this sacred book of the Mahomedans
entirely from remembrance. A portrait of this erudite Negro will
be found in the “Gentleman's Magazine,” vol. xx., date 1750.</p>

            <head>ANTHONY WILLIAM AMO</head>
            <p>was a native of Guinea, from which country he was brought
into Europe when very young. The Princess of Brunswick having
become interested in him, took charge of his education. He
pursued his studies first at Halle, in Saxony, and afterwards at
Wittemberg, at which place he so distinguished himself as to
gain a public letter of congratulation from the Rector and Council
of the University. Amo appears to have possessed a through
knowledge of the Latin and Greek languages; he also knew Hebrew,
French, Dutch, and German, and was versed in Astronomy. He
published several learned dissertations, which obtained the
approbation of the heads of the college, the president of which
gave him the honourable designation of <foreign lang="lat">“vir no bilissime et
clarissime:”</foreign> thus, as Armistead observes, “evincing belief in the
absurd prejudice which exists against coloured portions of
mankind.”</p>
            <pb id="adams49" n="49"/>
            <p>Admired, honoured, and respected, Amo might have
remained at the court of Berlin, where he occupied the
position of counsellor of state; but death having deprived him
of his benefactress, the Princess of Brunswick, he fell into a
desponding melancholy state, and—what a proof is here of how
closely interwoven into the very fibres of the human heart are the
ties of relationship and the associations of home!—he,
the learned, the polished, the enlightened man, earnestly
longed to return to the place of his birth, from which he
had been absent thirty years, wild and barbarous as it was,
and possessing, one would think, few attractions for a
cultivated and studious mind. To Axim, then, on the Gold Coast,
he returned, and there, in the year 1753, Amo being then about
fifty years of age, he was visited by an intelligent traveller
named Gallandat, who alludes to him in the Memoirs
of the Academy of Flessingue, of which he was a member. The
learned Negro was then living a secluded life; one
brother and a sister were with him; another brother was at the
time a slave in Surinam. Some time after he appears
to have left Axim, and settled at Chama, where we lose all
traces of his subsequent history.</p>

          <div3 type="subchapter">
            <head>GEOFFREY L'ISLET</head>
            <p>was a Mulatto officer of artillery in the Isle of France,
of the depôt of maps and plans of which island he was
also the authorized guardian. His historian does not inform
us where or when he was born, but we learn that he never
visited Europe, and therefore could not have availed himself
of those facilities for education and opportunities of improving
his taste, and acquiring a knowledge of men and things,
which are there offered to the student; that he was however,
a man exceedingly well versed in most branches of  physical
science there can be no doubt. In 1786 we learn that he was
named a corresponding member of the French Academy of
Sciences, to which learned body he regularly transmitted
meteorological observations, and occasionally hydrographical
journals. His maps of the Isles of France, founded upon
careful astronomical observations, were acknowledged to be the
best that had ever appeared; they were first published, with
other plans, in 1791, by order of the French Minister of
Marine; and in 1802 was issued a new edition, corrected from
drawings which the author transmitted to Paris. L'Islet
<pb id="adams50" n="50"/>
contributed several papers to the Almanac of the Isle of France,
among others a description of that remarkable natural
phenomenon the Pitrebot Mountain, one of the highest in the
island.</p>
            <p>In the archives of the Academy of Sciences were deposited a
collection of L'Islet's manuscript memoirs, the most interesting
of which is an account of a voyage which he made to the
Bay of St. Luce, an island of Madagascar; to this is attached a
good map of the Bay and of the coast. The author enters
somewhat fully into the natural resources, exchangeable
commodities, etc., of Madagascar, and gives a very curious
description of the manners and customs of the people. He
points out how much better it would be to encourage the arts of
peace, and promote habits of industry among the natives, than
to stimulate them to war for the purpose of obtaining slaves. Nor is
this the only proof that he was a man of an enlightened mind—
something more than a mere <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">savan.</hi></foreign> He seems to have struggled
manfully against the prejudices of colour and caste. He established a
scientific society in the Isle of France, which several Whites
refused to join because its founder had a skin a few shades
darker than their own; “a proof,” as the Abbé Grégoire pithily
observes, “that they were unworthy of such an honour.”</p>

            <head>CAPITIEN.</head>
            <p>ON the borders of the River St. Andre, in Africa, was born
James E. J. Capitien, so named by a benevolent individual, to
whom he was presented when quite young by a Negro trader.
By his kind master Capitien was instructed in the truths of
Christianity, baptized, and brought to Holland, where he
acquired the Dutch language. In the Hague, where he
commenced his studies, a pious and learned lady is said to have
first taught him Latin and the elements of the Greek, Hebrew,
and Chaldean tongues. From the Hague he went to the
University of Leyden, where he devoted himself mainly to
theology, intending there to fit himself for a preacher of the
Gospel to his heathen countrymen. In 1742, after he had
studied four years, and taken his degree, he left the University,
and went as a missionary to Elmina, on the Gold Coast, and
since that date nothing seems to have been heard of him,
excepting a report which reached Europe in 1802 of his having
abjured Christianity,
<pb id="adams51" n="51"/>
and returned to the idolatry of his fathers. This, however,
wants confirmation: Blumenback, who, in his work on the
Varieties of the Human Race, has a portrait of Capitien, could
find no authentic information against him, nor, we
believe, has any since transpired.</p>
            <p>An elegy in Latin on the death of his friend and preceptor,
Manger, minister at the Hague, was Capitien's first published
work; it exhibits good scholarship and considerable poetic
genius. A Latin dissertation on the calling of the Gentiles
he produced on his admission to the University of Leyden.
In this work, which is entitled <foreign lang="lat">“De Vocatione Ethnicorum,”</foreign>
he argues logically, forcibly, and, as it has been thought,
successfully, to establish, upon the authority of the Holy
Scriptures, the certainty of the promise of the Gospel, and
its comprehensiveness as embracing all nations; he
recommends, as a means of co-operating with the Almighty, the
cultivation of the language of those nations to whom the
blessings of Christianity are yet unknown. Among these
nations, he says, missionaries should be sent, who, by the
mild voice of persuasion, might win their affections, and so
dispose them to receive the truths of the Gospel. Verily
this is the right sort of teaching, although some would tell
us that the bayonet and the musket are the best introducers
of the Saviour's testament of love and mercy. In this
dissertation too he observes that “The Spaniards and Portugese 
exercise a mild and gentle treatment of their slaves,
establishing no superiority of colour, etc. In other countries
planters have prevented their Negroes from being instructed
in a religion which proclaims the equality of men, all
proceeding from a common stock, and equally entitled to the
benefits of a kind Providence, who is no respecter of persons.”</p>
            <p>This was very unpalatable to the Dutch planters, who
somehow afterwards contrived to make Capitien the apologist
of a bad system, and to prostitute his learning to the purpose
of proving that slavery is not incompatible with Christian
freedom. His politico-philosophical dissertation in Latin,
composed to this end, was translated into Dutch, and went
through four editions. It was embellished with a portrait of the
author in the garb of a preacher, in which character he
delivered several discourses at different towns in Holland;
these were collected and published in a quarto volume at
Amsterdam in 1742.</p>

            <head>OTHELLO.</head>
            <p>OF the life and character of this Negro nothing appears
to have been known to Grégoire beyond the fact, that he
published in the year 1788, at Baltimore, an essay against
the slavery of his race, in which he depicts, in strong colours
and with great force of language, the wretchedness of a state
of slavery, and the cruelty and injustice of those who keep
in bondage the unhappy children of Africa. We give an
extract from this remarkable production, and ask if the man
who could write thus was likely to be inferior in mental
capacity to those whom he addresses with such power and
eloquence:—“The European powers ought to unite in abolishing 
the infernal commerce in slaves; it is they who have
covered Africa with desolation. They declaim against
the people of Algiers, and they vilify, as barbarous, those who
inhabit a corner of that portion of the globe where ferocious
Europeans travel to purchase men, and carry them away
for the purpose of torture. These are the people who
pretend they are Christians, whilst they degrade themselves
by acting the part of an executioner.” Then applying his
remarks more particularly to the Americans, the indignant
Negro continues, “Is not your conduct, when compared with
your principles, a sacreligious irony? When you dare to talk 
of civilization and the Gospel, you pronounce your anathema. In
you the superiority of power produces nothing but a
superiority of brutality and barbarism. Weakness which calls
for protection, appears to provoke your inhumanity. Your fine
political systems are sullied by the outrages committed against
human nature and the Divine Majesty. When America opposed
the pretensions of England, she declared that all men have the
same rights of freedom and equality. After having manifested
her hatred against tyrants, ought she to have abandoned her
principles? Whilst we should bless the measures pursued in
Pennsylvania in favour of the Negroes, we must execrate those
of South Carolina, which even prevent the slaves from
learning to read. To whom can these unfortunates then address
themselves? The law either neglects or chastises them.”</p>

            <head>JAMES DERHAM</head>
            <p>was originally a slave in Philadelphia. His owner was a medical
man, who employed him as an assistant in the preparation of
his compounds. After passing through other hands,
he came into those of Dr. Dove, of New Orleans, of
which place he afterwards became one of the most distinguished
physicians. He was practising there in 1788, being then about
twenty-one years of age. Dr. Rush says, “I conversed
with him on medicine and found him very learned. I thought
I could give<hi rend="italics"> him</hi> information concerning the treatment
of disease; but I learned more from <hi rend="italics">him</hi> than he could
expect from me.”</p>
            <p>Dr. Derham spoke with ease and fluency the English, French,
and Spanish languages. The chief particulars concerning him
were obtained by Grégoire from an account published in 1789
by the Pennsylvanian Society, which was established to aid
and countenance the people of colour. It does not seem quite
clear whether Derham was the discoverer of the cure for the bite
of a rattlesnake, published by Buchan in his Domestic
Medicine, and also by Duplaint; certain it is that one of his
colour received his freedom, and an annuity of one hundred
pounds, from the general assembly of Carolina for this
important discovery.</p>

            <head>ATTOBAH CUGOANO.</head>
            <p>THIS was a man for whom education did but little, but who
nevertheless evinced great natural talent, and a high sense of the
obligations of Christian duty. Like his more learned
countryman Othello, he too wrote a work against slavery; and
although it was neither so eloquent nor argumentative as the
former production of the Negro mind, yet was there much in it
to convince the understanding, and awaken the feelings of the
heart.</p>
            <p>The birth-place of Cugoano—who, unlike most of the other
kidnapped Negroes, appears to have retained his native
appellation—was Agimaque, on the coast of Fantin, from
whence he was dragged, with twenty other children of both
sexes, by European robbers, who, with brandished arms,
threatened to kill them if they made any resistance. Being
taken to Grenada and sold into slavery, our hero was rescued
from his degraded condition by Lord Hoth, who
<pb id="adams54" n="54"/>
brought him to England, where, in 1788, we find him in the
service of Cosway, painter to the prince of Wales. An Italian
author named Piatole having, while residing in London, become
acquainted with him, speaks in strong terms of his piety, mildness
of character, modesty, integrity, and talents. The Negro was then
about forty-years of age. His work, “Reflections on the Slave-trade
and the Slavery of Negroes,” opens with a touching account of the
sufferings endured by those who are torn from their native country,
and forced to bid an eternal adieu to all that is dear to
them. “The spectacle,” he says, “calculated to move the
hearts of monsters does not that of the slave-dealer.” He
relates how, at Grenada, he saw Negroes lacerated by the
whip, because, instead of working, they went to church on
the Sabbath; and how others had their teeth broken, because
they dared to suck the sugar-cane. He endeavours to
prove, from the Scriptures, that the stealing, selling, and
purchase of men, and their retention in a state of slavery,
were crimes of the deepest dye; goes somewhat into the
causes of difference of colour in the human species;
and asks whether these differences give one race a right to
presume inferiority, and to enslave another. He observes
that “The Negroes have never crossed the seas to steal
white men,” and tells the Europeans that, “while complaining
of the barbarism of the Negroes, their conduct towards them
is horribly barbarous;” and further—listen, Oh ye white
teachers of Christianity! to this untaught sable teacher—
he says, that to steal men—to rob them of their liberty—
is worse than to plunder them of their goods, and that
“for national crimes heaven sometimes inflicts national
punishments; besides, injustice is, sooner or later, fatal to
its author.”</p>
            <p>Between ancient and modern slavery Cugoano makes a
striking comparison, which is worthy of especial attention from
those who rest their defence of the system upon the Old
Testament Scriptures. “The Hebrews did not steal 
men to enslave them, nor sell them without their consent,
neither did they put a fine upon the head of a fugitive. In
Deuteronomy it is expressly said, ‘Thou shalt not deliver up to
his master a fugitive slave who has sought in thy house an
asylum.’ ” And passing from the Old to the New Testament, the
simple Negro is greatly puzzled how to reconcile the
inconsistency of pro-slavery Christians with the command of
Christ, to do to others as we would they should do to us.</p>

            <head>BENJAMIN BANNEKER.</head>
            <p>THE subject of this brief memoir was born in the year
1732, in Baltimore county, state of Maryland, of coloured
parents who, although free, were of pure African descent. Their
circumstances were very humble, yet they managed
to send their boy, when of sufficient age, to a school where
nothing more than the mere elements of learning were taught,
and they left him at their decease a few acres of land,
acquired by honest toil. On this small farm, for which, we
are told, seven thousand pounds of tobacco, at one time
the common currency of the southern English colonies in
America, was paid, Banneker, or Bannaky, as the name was
then spelled, remained until his death, leading the simple
and secluded life of a peasant and a student; cultivating the
soil by day, watching the planets by night, and at all hours
and seasons closely observing the changes and aspects of
nature, and collecting those facts, on a comparison and
careful arragnement of which, was founded the wide-spread
reputation of “the Negro almanac-maker.”</p>
            <p>
For many years of his unobtrusive existence, Banneker
worked on unnoticed, digesting and applying the few simple
rules of arithmetic which he had acquired at school, and slowly
and laboriously making his way step by step, into the 
the realms of physical science, unaided by books or any other of
those appliances, which render the acquisition of knowledge
comparatively easy to the more favoured student. It was only by
very slow degrees that he became known in his own
neighbourhood as a man of considerable general information,
and great readiness in arithmetical calculations, so much so, as
to excite the wonder of the illiterate people about him; this
wonder of course was vastly increased when, being then about
thirty years of age, Banneker, constructed a clock, for which he
had no model, such a thing being unknown in the rural district
where he lived, which was about ten miles from Baltimore, not
then a large and flourishing city, but a straggling assemblage of
some twenty or thirty houses. Our mechanician had only the
rudest tools to work with, and for his guidance but the
recollection of a watch which he had once examined. His work
was one of great difficulty; he had many failures; but he 
persevered, and at length success crowned his efforts: the
clock was finished, and kept excellent time; and it did more than
this, for it widened the circle of its maker's fame, until it
reached the Ellicotts, an intelligent and ingenious
<pb id="adams56" n="56"/>
family, who loved to encourage humble merit. They lent
Banneker books, and these opened new worlds to his delighted
gaze; they lent him also some astronomical instruments, which
he soon learned to apply. And now his studies began
to assume a more regular and methodical form; he made
calculations of the motions of the heavenly bodies, and after
awhile felt so satisfied of their accuracy, as to entertain the idea
of completing a set for a whole year, and thus constructing an
almanac, and was so encouraged by the success of his first
attempt as to carry on the calculations to subsequent years.</p>
            <p>“Of the labour and difficulty of such a work,” says a recent
biographer of Banneker's,<ref id="ref10" n="10" rend="sc" target="note10" targOrder="U">* </ref> “no proper estimate could be
formed by one who should at this day commence such
a task, with all the assistance afforded by accurate tables and
well digested rules. Banneker had no such aid; and it is a curious
fact, that he had advanced far into the laborious preparation of
the logarithms necessary for his purpose, when he was furnished
with a set of tables by Mr. Ellicott. A memorandum contained in
his calculations corrects an error in Ferguson's Astronomy, and
deserves to be quoted as an evidence of the propriety and clearness
with which this self-educated mathematician expressed himself on
scientific points. ‘It appears to me,’ he writes, ‘that the wisest of men
may sometimes be in error; for instance, Dr. Ferguson informs us
that when the sun is within 12° of either node at the time of full, the
moon will be eclipsed; but I find, according to his method of projecting
a lunar eclipse, that there will be none by the above elements, and
yet the sun is within 11° 46' 11" of the moon's ascending
node; but the moon being in her apogee, prevents the 
appearance of this eclipse.’ In like manner he points out two
mistakes in Leadbeater's Astronomical Tables. His biographer
remarks, and no doubt truly enough, that ‘both Ferguson and
Leadbeater would probably have looked incredulous,
had they been informed that their laboured works
had been reviewed and corrected by a free Negro, in the
then almost unheard-of valley of the Patapsco.’ ”</p>
            <p>In the first of Banneker's published almanacks, which was
calculated for the year 1792, is a long letter to Mr. Jefferson,
then President of the United States. It is a composition which
evinces considerable literary ability, and it is valuable as giving
free and unreserved expression to the feelings of
<note id="note10" n="10" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref10">*  Vide “Leisure Hour,” No. 56.</note>
<pb id="adams57" n="57"/>
the injured Negro on the score of his presumed inferiority to
the white man. The writer reminds Mr. Jefferson of that
standing reproach of American slavery, the celebrated passage
in the Declaration of Independence, which informs the world
that “all men are created and are endowed by their Creator with
certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness,” and then goes on to remark (Jefferson, be
it remembered, was the author of that noble declaration,) 
“You were then impressed with proper ideas of the great valuation
of liberty, and the free possession of those blessings to which you
were entitled by nature; but, Sir, how pitiable is it to reflect, that
although you were so fully convinced of the benevolence of the Father
of mankind, and of his equal and impartial distribution of those
rights and privileges which he had conferred upon them, you
should at the same time counteract his mercies, in detaining by
fraud and violence so numerous a part of my brethren under
groaning captivity and cruel oppression; that you should at the 
same time be found guilty of that most criminal act which you
professedly detest in others.”</p>
            <p>The reply of the President to this plain-spoken letter is so
honourable to himself, and to his dark-skinned brother, that we
cannot forbear quoting it entire.</p>

                    <p>Sir, I thank you sincerely for your
letter of the 19th. instant, and for the almanac which, it
contained. Nobody wishes more than I do to see such proofs as
you exhibit that nature has given to our black brethren talents
equal to those of the other colours of men, and that the
appearance of a want of them is owing only to the degraded
condition of their existence both in Africa and America. I can add
with truth that no one wishes more ardently to see a good
system commenced for raising the condition both of their body
and mind to what it ought to be, as fast as the imbecility of their
present existence, and other circumstances which cannot be
neglected, will admit. I have taken the liberty of sending your
almanac to Mons de Condorcet, secretary to the Academy of
Sciences at Paris, and member of the Philanthropic Society,
because I considered it a document to which your whole colour
<pb id="adams58" n="58"/>
had a right, for their justification against the doubts which have
been entertained of them.</p>

Your most obedient Servant,</salute>

            <p>Banneker died in 1809, and his almanacks, which were in
much request, were continued until 1802; their calculations
were so thorough and exact as to have won the approbation of
such men as Pitt, Fox, and Wilberforce: one of them was
produced in the British House of Commons as an argument in
favour of the mental capacity of the coloured people, and of
their emancipation.</p>
            <p>Much more that is interesting might be told about this Negro
mathematician, did our space permit; fuller particulars of his life
will be found in the article from which we have already quoted
(Leisure Hour,) most of the facts embodied in which are
derived, we are told, from a memoir read before the Maryland
Historical Society a few years ago, these facts, although not
generally known in America, being perfectly well authenticated.</p>

            <head>FRANCIS WILLIAMS</head>
            <p>was a native of Jamaica, where he was born in the year 1700;
when quite young, he gave such manifestation of ability that
the Duke of Montague, who was then Governor of the island,
determined on trying whether, if placed in the same
circumstances of improvement, he would be found
equal to one of a fairer skin, the impression being generally
adverse to such an opinion. This interesting psychological
experiment was successfully carried out; Williams was sent to
England, and, after passing through his elementary studies at a
private school, entered the University of Cambridge, where his
progress in mathematics and other branches of science was
highly satisfactory. Having, while in Europe, published a poem
which obtained considerable popularity, an attempt was made
by certain persons, who were enraged that a Negro should
obtain any literary pre-eminence, to to show that it was not
entirely his own production; in this, however, they were
unsuccessful.</p>
            <p>When Williams returned to Jamaica, his patron offered to
obtain for him a place in the Government Council; this
<pb id="adams59" n="59"/>
he declined, and preferred opening a school under patronage of
the Governor. He appears to have been accomplished classical
and mathematical scholar; it was his custom to present a Latin
poem to each successor to the Governorship of the island, and
of one of these finished productions of his muse a translation in
French is given by the Abbé Grégoire, and one in English by
Long, in his History of Jamaica, published in 1774, that is,
about four years after the death of Williams, which took place
at the ripe age of seventy years. The Negro schoolmaster had
prepared to succeed him in his educational duties, a young man
of his own race and colour, who unfortunately became
deranged: a proof, says the historian Long, that African heads
are incapable of following out a course of abstruse study: as if
European heads had never become unsettled by such means,
even admitting that this was the cause of the derangement of
intellect in Williams's pupil. Long was much prejudiced
against the Negroes, and he accuses Williams of imitation and
servility in his poetical offerings to the Governors, because
he compares them to the heroes of antiquity, forgetting that
some of our own greatest poets are open to the same reproach.
On the publication of the particular “Carmen” addressed to
George Haldane, Esq., of which Long gives a versified
translation, the Dean of Middleham, alluding to those who
would class the Negroes with monkeys, indignantly observed,
“I never heard it said that an orang-outang had composed a poem,
nor do we find among the defenders of slavery one-half of the
literary merit of Phillis Wheatley and Francis Williams.”</p>

            <p>IT was of this man that Roccho Pirro, author of the “Sicilia
Sacra,” wrote, “His body was black, but it pleased God to
testify by miracles the whiteness of his soul.” Several other
historians speak of him in the like terms of admiration,
and in Palermo, where he died in 1589, his tomb and memory,
we are told, are generally revered. Of his life we have no other
particulars to record, than that there shone around it the light
of an assemblage of eminent virtues; that he was a Negro born
of a slave mother; and, in addition to the name above given,
was sometimes called Benoit of St. Philadelphia or Santo
Fratello, and that he was the son of a slave negress.</p>

            <head>HANNIBAL,</head>
            <p>sometimes called Annibal, was a Negro of great ability, who
became known to the Czar Peter I. during his travels, and was
by him raised to the rank of Lieutenant-General and Director of
Artillery, and invested with the red riband of the order of St.
Alexander Neuski. In 1784 his son, a Mulatto, was in the
Russian service as Lieutenant-General of Artillery. St. Perre and
La Harpe both say that he had the reputation of great talent;
under the orders of Prince Potemkin, minister of war, he
established a port and fortress at Cherson, near the mouth of
the Dnieper.</p>
            <p>We must here bring the testimony, of the learned and pious
Frenchman to a conclusion, having yet many witnesses to cite, in
support of our assertion of the mental capability of the Negro race.
With such facts as these before us, we may well exclaim with
Bishop Warburton, “Gracious God! to talk of men as herds of
cattle; of property in rational creatures, creatures endowed with
all our faculties, possessing all our qualities but that of colour,
our brethren both by nature and by grace, shocks all the feelings of
humanity, and the dictates of common sense!”</p>
            <p>And well too may we repeat, with a quickened sense of their
truth and beauty, the noble lines of Milton:—</p>

          <head>OLAUDAH EQUIANO.</head>
          <p>THIS intelligent Negro, who had conferred upon him the name
of Gustavus Vasa, published, about 1787, a narrative of his
somewhat eventful life, which went through several editions,
and exhibited considerable talent in the composition, as well as
a large amount of general information in the mind from which it
emanated. The dedication of this book to the British Houses of
Parliament is so remarkable a document, that we are glad to
give our readers an opportunity of perusing it.—</p>

                  <p>Permit me, with the greatest deference
and respect, to lay at your feet the following genuine
narrative; the chief design of which is to excite in your
august assemblies a sense of compassion for the miseries
which the slave-trade has entailed on my unfortunate
countrymen. By the horrors of this trade was I first torn away from
all the tender connexions that were naturally dear to my heart;
but these, through the mysterious ways of Providence, I ought
to regard as infinitely more than compensated by the
introduction I have thence obtained to the knowledge of the
christian religion, and of a nation, which, by its liberal
sentiments, its humanity, the glorious freedom of its
government, and its proficiency in arts and sciences, has
exalted the dignity of human nature. I am sensible I ought to
entreat your pardon for addressing to you a work so wholly
devoid of literary merit; but, as the production of an unlettered
African, who is actuated by the hope of becoming an
instrument towards the relief of his suffering countrymen, I
trust that such a man, pleading in such a cause, will be
acquitted of boldness and presumption. May the God of
heaven inspire your hearts with peculiar benevolence in that
important day when the question of abolition is to be
discussed, when thousands, in consequence of your decision,
are to look for happiness or misery.</p>

          <p>Who shall say that the prayers of this enlightened and
pious Negro, as he really appeared to have been, sent up
to the footstool of the God of heaven, had no effect in
bringing about the emancipation of his dark-skinned brothers
and sisters in the British colonies? What unsuspected
influence they may have had in the great work afterwards
accomplished by Clarkson, Wilberforce, Granville Sharpe,
George Thompson, and the other noble champions of freedom,
who can tell? They went up like incense; they may have
fallen like dew, strengthening and refreshing those who bore
the heat and the burden of the anti-slavery contest; softening
and disposing to pity those whom interest, or prejudice, or
other cause, rendered their sturdiest opponents. The prayer
of a righteous man, we are told, “availeth much;” and
doubtless poor Olaudah, in a strange land, far away from
his native palm groves, and all that, as he says, was “naturally
dear to his heart,” often prayed for those who were in exile like
himself, and far worse than himself, in harsh and cruel bondage.</p>
          <p>But let us return to the “Narrative,” of which the second
edition, in two volumes, bearing date 1789, is now before us. It
has a goodly list of subscribers, among whom are the Prince of
Wales, the Bishop of London, several dukes, earls, and others
of the English nobility, showing that this child of Africa was
considered worthy of powerful patronage and countenance, and
affording some guarantee for the truth of his statements.</p>
          <p>In his opening chapter, after some naive remarks upon the
motives which are generally attributed to those who write their
own memoirs, and the contemptuous way in which the lives
of obscure individuals like himself are commonly received, our
author goes on to say, “If then the following narrative does not
prove sufficiently interesting to engage general attention, let
my motive be some excuse for its publication. I am not so
foolishly vain as to expect from it either immortality or literary
reputation. If it affords any satisfaction to my numerous
friends, at whose request it has been written, or in the smallest
degree promotes the interests of humanity, the end for which it
was undertaken will be fully attained, and every wish of my
heart gratified. Let it therefore be remembered, that in wishing
to avoid censure, I do not aspire to praise.”</p>
          <p>An interesting account is then given of Equiano's birthplace,
of which we quote the opening paragraph as a good example of
the author's simple, yet nervous style of description.
<pb id="adams63" n="63"/>
“That part of Africa known by the name of Guinea,
in which the trade for slaves is carried on, extends along the
coast above three thousand four hundred miles, from Senegal
to Angola, and includes a variety of kingdoms. Of these
the most considerable is the kingdom of Benin, both
as to extent and wealth, the richness and cultivation of the soil,
the power of its king, and the number and warlike disposition
of the inhabitants. It is situated nearly under the line, and
extends along the coast about one hundred and seventy
miles, but runs back into the interior part of Africa
to a distance hitherto, I believe, unexplored by any
traveller; and seems only terminated by the empire of
Abyssinia, nearly fifteen hundred miles from its first
boundaries. In a charming and fruitful vale, called Essaka, in
one of the most remote and fertile provinces of this kingdom, I
was born in the year 1745.”</p>
          <p>After dwelling awhile upon the memory of his youthful
days, and telling us that he, the youngest of several sons
of a man of rank, was an especial favourite with his mother.
Equiano thus relates the method of his abdication from home
and kindred, which took place when he was eleven years old:—
“One day when our people were gone to their work, and only
my dear sister (he had but one) and myself were left
to watch the house, two men and a woman came, and
seizing us both, stopped our mouths that we should not make
a noise, ran off with us into the woods, where
they tied our hands, and took us to some distance to a small
house, where the robbers halted for refreshment, and
spent the night. We were then unbound, but were unable to
take any food, and being quite overpowered by fatigue
and grief, our only relief was some sleep, which allayed our
misfortune for a short time. The next morning, after keeping
the woods some distance, we came to an opening
where we saw some people at work. I began to cry out for
their assistance, but my cries had no other effect than to make
them tie us faster, and again stop our mouths, and they put us
into a sack until we got out of sight of these
people. When they offered us food we could not eat, often
bathing each other in tears. Our only respite was sleep—but
alas! even the privilege of weeping together was soon denied
us. The next day proved a day of greater sorrow
than I had yet experienced, for my sister and I were torn asunder
while clasping in each other's arms; it was in vain that we
besought them not to part us; she was torn from me, and
immediately carried away, while I was left in a state
<pb id="adams64" n="64"/>
of distraction not to be described. I wept and groaned continually,
and for several days did not eat anything but what they forced into my
mouth.”</p>
          <p>The poor captive travels a great way, and suffers many
hardships, before he and his sister are again brought together;
they do however meet, and enjoy the luxury of weeping in
each other's arms; but after a brief period they are again separated,
and this time for ever.</p>
          <p>Footsore and weary, and with a despairing heart, the African
youth is forced to travel onward to the coast, leaving farther
and farther behind him at every step his childhood's home, and
relatives, and friends; he passes into many strange hands,
makes a fruitless attempt to escape, and after six or seven
months journeying through dreary wastes, and dismal woods,
arrives at the sea-shore, where, he says, “The first object that
met my sight was a slave-ship riding at anchor, waiting for her
cargo! I was filled with astonishment, which was soon
converted into terror, which I am quite at a loss to describe.</p>
          <p>When I was taken on board, being roughly handled and
closely examined by these men, whose complexion and
language differed so much from any I had seen or heard before,<hi rend="italics"> I
apprehended I had got into a world of bad spirits.</hi> When I looked
around the ship too, and saw the multitude of black people of all
descriptions chained together, every one of their countenances
expressing dejection and sorrow, I no longer doubted my fate;
and being quite overpowered with horror and anguish, I fell
motionless on the deck and fainted. When I recovered a little,
the horrible faces of the white men frightened me again
exceedingly. But I had not time to think much about it,
before I was, with many of my poor country people, put under
deck in a loathsome and horrible place. In this situation we
wished for death, and sometimes refused to eat; and for this we
were beaten. Such were now my horrors and fears, that if ten
thousand worlds had been my own, I would have freely parted
with them all, to have exchanged my condition with that of the
meanest slave in my own country.”</p>
          <p>The horrors of “the middle passage” have been so often
described, that we need not sicken and disgust our readers with
the account here given of them; suffice it that Equiano
and such of his fellow-captives as survive their sufferings
and privations, are landed at Barbadoes, and in the slave
market of that island, sold like cattle, singly or in lots, as
best suited the convenience of purchasers. “In this manner,”
<pb id="adams65" n="65"/>
says the narrator, “without scruple are relations and friends
separated, most of them never to see each other again. I
remember in the vessel in which I was brought over, there
were several brothers, who, in the sale, were sold in different
lots; and it, was very moving on this occasion to see and hear
their cries at parting. O ye nominal christians! might not an
African ask you, learned you this from your God, who says
unto you, <hi rend="italics">Do unto all men as you would men should do unto
you?</hi> Is it not enough that we are torn from our country and
friends, to toil for your luxury and lust of gain? Must every
tender feeling be likewise sacrificed to your avarice? Are the
dearest friends and relations, now rendered more dear by their
separation from their kindred, still to be parted from each other,
and thus prevented from cheering the gloom of slavery with the
small comfort of being together, and mingling their sufferings
and sorrows? Why are parents to lose their children, brothers
their sisters, or husbands their wives? Surely this is a new
refinement in cruelty, which, while it has no advantage to atone
for it, thus aggravates distress, and adds fresh horrors even to
the wretchedness of slavery.”</p>
          <p>The <sic corr="trafficker">trafficer</sic> in human flesh and blood, muscle and sinew
would doubtless tell our black philanthropist that this rending
asunder of the ties of kindred and affection has its profit
and advantages, or it would not be done; and no doubt
Equiano himself, when he got into Virginia, where it was
his lot soon after to be carried, saw enough of the working
of the slavery system to convince him of this, although the
then English colony did but a very small amount of business
in black cattle, compared with what is done at the present time
by the free, enlightened, and independent state.</p>
          <p>In America our hero remains but a short time before he is
shipped to England as a present, like a monkey or racoon, or
any other curious animal might be. On his passage to this
country, the name of the renowned warrior of Sweden,
Gustavus Vasa, is given to him by the ship's crew, probably
out of derision, and this, which was at first but a nick-name,
he retained through life. He also at this time received some
elementary instruction from a youth, five or six years older
than himself, who took a liking to him, and did him many good
turns. Speaking of the death of this kind friend, which
happened at an early age, Equiano says, “I lost at once a kind
interpreter, an agreeable companion, and a faithful friend, who,
at the age of fifteen, discovered a mind superior to prejudice,
and who was not ashamed to notice,
<pb id="adams66" n="66"/>
to associate with, and to be the friend and instructor of me,
who was ignorant, a stranger of a different complexion, and a
slave.”</p>
          <p>Equiano's master being an officer in the British navy,
much of the Negro's time is spent on board different ships
of war, not at any time the best school of morality, and at
that time, namely, from 1757 to 1761, certainly a much worse
school than it is now; nevertheless, during that period some
religious impressions seem to have reached our hero's mind;
he became, nominally at least, a member of the christian
church, receiving the rite of baptism, and conforming in some
degree to its requirements; nor does this seem to have been
altogether outward profession merely. We gather from his
narrative that even thus early in life, he felt the quickening
of those seeds of piety, which were afterwards to produce
fruit, and decidedly influence his character for good; and
here we may observe that the Negro mind seems to be
peculiarly susceptible of religious impressions, and that much
may be hoped and looked for from planting of the christianity
in a soil so favourable to its growth and development.</p>
          <p>Naturally the Negro is gentle, teachable, and mild; humble
and simple as a very child; with no pride of intellect to stand
in the way of his belief in a dying Saviour's love, or a glorified
Redeemer's power. The faith which hopeth all things,
believeth all things, loveth all things, he embraces
readily, because it best accords with his warm overflowing
sympathies, and his unsuspecting, kindly nature. To him the
moral code of the New Testament does not appear like an
abstract theory, incapable of application to the affairs of
everyone's life, nor its sublimer revelations of divine truth as
something too mysterious and incomprehensible for human
credence. Whether with greater cultivation of his intellectual
powers will come the hardness of heart, and the scepticism of
mind, which so fatally impede the growth in grace of what are
generally considered the more favoured races of mankind, has
yet to be seen; at present he is very low in the valley of
humiliation, the most favourable position, as Rowland Hill
tells us, for observing the height of the hill of God's of goodness.
We, however, have better hopes for him, and are inclined to think
that the greatest supporters and exemplars of christianity among
men, will be found among the now abused and despised Negroes.</p>
          <p>As militating somewhat against our theory, we shall be
reminded perhaps of the fetish and the slave-hunt, of the
horrible superstitions, and the barbarous wars of the native
<pb id="adams67" n="67"/>
Africans; of the duplicity, the dishonesty, the often-times
fierce revengeful spirits, and sullen morose tempers, of the
enslaved portions of the race. In reply to the first part of the
objection, we would observe, that among all uncivilized people
rites and customs prevail, which are abhorent to the better
instructed christian; and with regard to the latter we would ask,
what can be expected to result from a system which so
degrades and brutifies a class of men, repressing everything that
is noble and generous in them, and encouraging the
growth of all that is vicious and mischievous in their
merely animal nature. If there had not been in the Negro
character, a large admixture of the gentler elements
of patience, and endurance, and love, and submission, we
should have seen long ere this a servile war of a most
disasterous and bloody character, or a series of isolated
struggles, burnings, and assassinations, only equalled in
<sic corr="number">nubmer</sic>, and atrocity to the cruelties practised upon the
unhappy slaves, by their unscrupulous white masters, and only
ended with the destruction of the slavery system.</p>
          <p>We must now give a brief summary of the other leading
events of Equiano's life. At the conclusion of the war, when he
had got tired, or no longer required the services of his Negro
attendant, the British officer, doubtless “an honourable man” in
the estimation of the world, had the poor youth, to whom he
had promised his freedom, conveyed on board one of a fleet of
Indiamen then waiting for convoy, with instructions to the
captain to sell him in the West Indies, whither the fleet was
bound. On arrival at Montserrat these instructions were
complied with, notwithstanding the prayers and remonstrances
of the Negro, and he became the property of one Mr. King, a
charitable and humane merchant, whose settled residence was in
Philadelphia. Equiano here gives some revelations of the
dreadful treatment of the slaves in the West Indies, a perusal of
the record of which should make every Englishman blush for
shame, and teach him to be charitable and forbearing in his
strictures upon those who are still entangled in the meshes of
that frightful system of wrong and oppression, which we have
happily shaken off as a thing too hideous to be longer borne or
tolerated. We see that not only the slaves, but the masters
also, become embruted under its influence, and we scarcely
wonder at any atrocities which men may commit, who are
placed within that sphere of temptation and moral contamination
which is involved in the legalized existence of slavery.</p>
          <pb id="adams68" n="68"/>
          <p>In the service of Mr. King, Equiano spends several years,
mostly in one or other of the trading vessels, of which his
master is owner, passing backwards and forwards between
the West India Islands and America; he meets with many
strange adventures, which are related in such a simple, artless
style, that the reader is impressed at once with a conviction of
their truthfulness. Both the merchant and the captain, with whom
he sails, are unusually kind to the Negro, who proves himself
a useful and faithful servant; he is allowed to trade
a little on his own account, and eventually realizes
sufficient to repay his owner the sum which he
originally cost, that is£40, and thus procures his freedom; his
value was at this time much greater, but in consideration of his
faithful services, and out of regard for a pledge which he had
formerly given to that effect, Mr. King, more conscientious
than the British officer, signs his paper of manumission; and so
poor Olaudah is a free man. We should like to describe in his own
words the joy, the ecstacy, with which he is filled at the almost
unhoped-for result of his toils and sufferings. His heart
overflows with gratitude to God and his kind master, to whom
he continues for awhile to devote his best energies, although he
earnestly longs to return to England, and acquaint those who
had formerly befriended him, with his good fortune. The trading
vessel in which he now sails is wrecked on one of the Keys
the Bahamas, and our hero has there and elsewhere several
narrow escapes of his life; after which he returns to
Montserrat, bids adieu to his good friend and ever kind master,
and finally sailed for England, fully convinced that the West
Indies was no safe place for a black man, although nominally free,
to reside in; there, as now in the southern states of
America, the laws afforded little or no protection to the Negro,
who might be abused and misused in every way, without the
possibility of obtaining redress; his evidence was not taken in a
court of justice; and consequently his property and even his
life was at the mercy of every scoundrel with a white skin, who
chose to appropriate the one, or threaten the other. Well then
might Equiano rejoice to turn his back upon such a region of
wrong and suffering to the African, and set his face steadily
towards the land of refuge for the oppressed of every clime and
colour—of real freedom, for the poet as well said—</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“Slaves cannot breathe in England,</l>
            <l>They touch our country, and their shackles fall.”</l>
          </lg>
          <pb id="adams69" n="69"/>
          <p>After what the narrator calls a prosperous voyage of seven
weeks, and an absence altogether of about four years, the
feet of Olaudah once more press the British soil, and his
old master, Capt. Pascal, who had caused him to be sold
into slavery, has a quiet ramble in Greenwich Park somewhat
unpleasantly interrupted by the apparition of his black-faced
cabin-boy, who reminds him of certain faithful services,
and their ill requital; the noble captain is also told of
prize-money due to the poor Negro, of which he denies all
knowledge, at the same time asserting that if the Negro's
prize-money had been £10,000, he, the captain, had a right
to it all. It would perhaps have been difficult for him to have
proved this right; however, he was not called on to do so, for
Olaudah thought it best to put up with the loss, if loss there
were, and turn his attention to some honest calling for his
subsistence. He learns hair-dressing, also the French horn, and
arithmetic, all at the same time; and having in these
acquirements expended the little sum of money which he
brought ashore with him, he hires himself to assist one Dr.
Charles Irving, who was celebrated in his day and generation for a
process by which he converted salt water into fresh. Our hero
finds the Dr. an excellent master; has time to pursue his studies,
which he esteems a great blessing, thanks God, and uses all
diligence to improve his opportunity of gaining knowledge. His
wages, however, are small, not above £12 per annum; and after
awhile finding this insufficient for his wants, mental and bodily,
he resolves to go to sea again, and so takes service under one
John Jolly, “a neat, smart, good humoured man,” who has a
ship going to Italy and Turkey, and wants a man who can dress
hair well. For about three years Equiano seems to have passed
his time pleasantly enough in this service, making three voyages,
one to the above-named places, one to Portugal, and another to
various ports in the Mediterranean.</p>
          <p>In 1771 he becomes steward of a ship bound for the West
Indies, and visits Barbadoes and the Granadas Islands, which
he had not seen before; and directly on his return from this
voyage enters another ship bound for the same
part of the world, but not the same islands—Nevis and Jamaica
being the ports entered; and this completes the round of his
observations of nearly the whole of the West India group of
islands; in all of which he finds the same cruelty and disregard
of the rights of humanity in reference to the treatment of the
Negro slaves; and some of the
<pb id="adams70" n="70"/>
scenes which he witnessed, or heard of, are harrowing and
disgusting in the extreme. Everywhere it is the same—
irresponsible power! unbridled passions! degradation and
misery and death on the one hand; pride, insolence, cupidity,
and disregard of suffering on the other; a terrible catalogue of
crime for the present, and a fearful amount of retribution for
the future.</p>
          <p>Once more back to England, our hero returns to the service
of Dr. Irving, but does not remain long on land,
for on the fitting out of an expedition designed to discover
a north-east passage to India, he joins it with his <sic corr="master">mast r</sic>,
the Dr., whom he attends on board the Race-Horse, sloop-
of-war, in May, 1773. Here he is thrown into new scenes
of perilous adventure, and has more hair-breadth escapes,
which however do not deter him from venturing on the sea
again; for soon after his return from this arctic expedition,
we find him on board a ship fitting out for Turkey, for
which country and its people he seems to have had a great
liking, in this ship he also procured the entry, as cook
of a coloured man, who was claimed, and forcibly taken
away by a West India proprietor. Equiano made great
efforts to rescue this poor fellow, who it seems was by
right a free man, but in vain; he was conveyed to St Kitts,
and there cruelly punished, obtaining release from his bondage
only by death. About this time our hero is much troubled and 
depressed by convictions of sin, and concern for the state of his
soul; and he set about earnestly enquiring the way of salvation,
into which, after much wrestling, and praying, and searching of
the scriptures, he is directed by that light of divine grace,
which lighteneth every one who seeks it in the true spirit of
penitent humility.</p>
          <p>In March, 1775, our author embarks for Cadiz, in the bay of
which place he is near being wrecked; he next visits Gibraltar
and Malaga, and then returns to London, meeting in his short
voyage with many displays of providential mercy. In
November of the same year he sails with his old master, Dr.
Irving, for Jamaica and the Musquito shore, where the
Dr. has determined to settle, and cultivate a plantation. On the
passage out Equiano earnestly endeavours to instruct in the
truths of christianity four Musquito Indians, who were chiefs in
their own country, one of them being the son of a king; these
were returning to their native land, from whence they had been
brought by some English traders for selfish purposes, at the
government expense. The profane habits of the nominal christians
are great stumbling-blocks
<pb id="adams71" n="71"/>
in the way of the conversion of the heathen. The Musquito
prince asks his instructor, “How comes it that all the white
men on board, who can read, and write, and observe the sun,
and know all things, yet swear, and get drunk, only
excepting yourself?” “The reason is,” replied the sable
teacher, “that they do not fear God,” and he does his best to
improve this and every other opportunity of spiritually
enlightening the Indian's mind.</p>
          <p>Equiano remains with Dr. Irving at the African settlement
until the middle of the year 1776, when being disgusted with
this heathenish mode of life, he applies for, and obtains, his
discharge, and with it a certificate of good conduct and ability.
He now goes on board a vessel bound for Jamaica, from which,
after being cruelly used by one of the owners on board, who
threatens to sell him into slavery, and is very near shooting
him, he is glad to escape back to the shore. By and by, he
agrees for a passage to Jamaica in another vessel, and is again
deceived, being taken to the southward along the Musquito
coast, and obliged to assist in cutting logwood to load the
vessel. Falling in, while thus employed, with a sloop
bound, as her captain told him, for the desired port,
he begs to be permitted to go on board of her, and after
much difficulty, accomplishes his wish, and here again
disappointment meets him; the sloop goes still farther to the
south, trading along the coast, instead of returning to Jamaica,
where, however, after long delay and much suffering he
eventually arrives. His demand upon the captain of the sloop
for wages, according to agreement, is as useless as are all his
efforts to obtain redress; not one of the nine magistrates
in Kingstone could do anything for him, because his oath
could not be admitted against a white man.</p>
          <p>To escape a severe beating threatened by his debtor,
Equiano takes refuge on board the Squirrel man-of-war, and
soon after returns to England, reaching Plymouth in January,
1777. In that town and Exeter he remains a little time with
some pious friends, and then goes to London
“with a heart replete with thanks to God for past mercies.”</p>
          <p>In 1779 he enters the service of Governor Macnamara, who
had been a considerable time on the coast of Africa, and finding
him to be of a religious turn of mind, and thinking that he
might be of service in converting his countrymen to the faith of
the gospel, advises him to apply to the Bishop of London for
ordination as a missionary. The Bishop, however, declines to
ordain him; and after serving a nobleman in the Dorsetshire
Militia, and then
<pb id="adams72" n="72"/>
visiting, from motives of curiosity, eight counties of England,
he, in the spring of 1784, once more embarks upon the
ocean.</p>
          <p>After performing two voyages to America, and visiting
New York and Philadelphia, where “he was much pleased to
see the worthy Quakers freeing and easing the burdens of his
oppressed African brethren,” he, in 1786, is recommended to
the commissioners of the Royal Navy as a proper
person to act as commissary for the English government in
an expedition then preparing to sail, the object of which
was to restore to their native country the coloured persons
congregated in London, of which there seems to have been
at that time a considerable number. This expedition, from
a concurrence of adverse circumstances, proves unfortunate;
and in conducting his part of the duty, Equiano makes many
enemies by the decided opposition which he offers to the
flagrant abuses of the government agent and others, whose
powerful influence is successfully used to obtain his dismissal
from office. The memorial which he drew up on this occasion,
and presented to the commissioners, was received, and a
repayment made of the amount of the amount that he expended
in his preparation for the voyage, as well as that of due wages,
and something over,—a plain proof that he was not considered
culpable in this matter.</p>
          <p>In March, 1788, Equiano had the honour of presenting to the
Queen a petition, which he had drawn up in behalf of his African
brethren. This was graciously received, and no doubt gave some
impetus to the anti-slavery movement which was just then
commencing.</p>
          <p>Heartily must we all join in the prayer uttered by this
intelligent Negro towards the conclusion of his interesting
narrative, “May heaven make British senators the dispensers
of light, liberty, and science, to the uttermost parts of the
earth; then will be ‘glory to God in the highest, on earth
peace and good-will to men.’ ‘It is righteousness that
exalteth a nation; but sin is a reproach to any people;
destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity, and the
wicked shall fall by their own wickedness.’ May the blessing of the
Lord be upon the heads of all those who commiserate the case of
the oppressed Negroes, and the fear of God prolong their days;
and may their expectations be filled with gladness! ‘The liberal
<sic corr="devise">divise</sic> liberal things, and by liberal things shall they stand.’ They
can say with pious Job, ‘Did not I weep for him that was in trouble?
was not my soul grieved for the poor?’ ”</p>
          <pb id="adams73" n="73"/>
          <p>Equiano tells us that he was named <hi rend="italics">Olaudah</hi>, which signifies
vicissitude, and truly a life of vicissitude was his; reading it we
may well confess that truth <hi rend="italics">is</hi> “stranger than fiction;” and we
ought to confess too that this black brother of ours was
manifestly as much the object of God's providential care, as the
most gifted and powerful of human beings. Yes, this child of a
despised race, and a dark skin, he too had a soul to be cared for,
and to be saved.</p>
          <p>Of the later events of Equiano's life we have no other
record than that given by Abb<sic corr="eacute">e</sic> Grégoire, who says that he
married in London, and had a son named Sancho, to whom
he gave so good an education, that he was qualified to become
assistant librarian to Sir Joseph Banks, and secretary to the
committee for Vaccination.</p>
          <p>One more extract from the narrative before us we must
make in conclusion, as it bears especially upon the main
argument of this work. After alluding to the prejudice
which exists in the minds of many against a coloured skin,
our author says, “Are there not causes enough to which the
apparent inferiority of an African may be ascribed, without
limiting the goodness of God, and supposing he forebore to
stamp understanding on certainly his own image, because
‘carved in ebony,’ might it not naturally be ascribed to their
situation. When they come among Europeans they are
ignorant of their language, religion, manners, and customs.
Are any pains taken to teach them these? Are they treated
as men? Does not slavery depress the mind, and extinguish
all its fire and every noble sentiment? But, above all, what
advantages do not a refined people possess over those who are
uncultivated? Let the polished and haughty European recollect
that his ancestors were once, like the African, uncivilized and
even barbarous. Did Nature make them inferior to their sons?
and should they too have been made slaves? Every rational
mind answers, No! Let such reflections as these melt the pride
of their superiority into sympathy for the wants and miseries
of their sable brethren, and compel them to acknowledge that
understanding is not confined to feature or colour. If, when
they look <sic corr="around the">aroundthe</sic> world, they feel exultation, let it be
tempered with benevolence to others, and gratitude to God,
‘who hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell
on the face of the earth; and whose wisdom in not our wisdom,
neither are our ways his ways.’”</p>

            <head>PHILLIS WHEATLEY, ETC.</head>
            <p>WE gather the particulars contained in this chapter from No.
63 of “Chambers's Miscellany of Useful and Entertaining
Tracts,” the interesting information contained in which we have
necessarily given in a condensed form. The tract, to which we
have previously referred, is entitled “Intelligent Negroes;” and
perhaps the most remarkable of those there instanced as proofs of
great mental capacity in the Negro race, is the young woman
whose name is given above. Purchased in the slave-market of
Boston, in the year 1761, by a benevolent lady, who selected
her from a number of more robust and healthy-looking,
children, on account of her apparent intelligence and modesty,
the little Phillis, as she was afterwards called, with nothing to
cover her nakedness but a ragged strip of dirty carpet, was taken
from the human cattle-fold to the house which was henceforward
to be her home, she being then between seven and eight years of age.
In sixteen months from this period what a change has
taken place in the poor African girl! the uncouth gibberish
of her native tongue, and the wild gesticulations of untaught 
barbarism, are changed for a language smooth and intelligible
to all around, and a carriage and demeanour suitable to
European ideas of propriety and decorum. So rapid had
been her progress in knowledge, under the tuition of the
daughter of her mistress, that she had not only mastered
the elements of the English tongue, but could read with
ease the most difficult parts of holy writ. Her extraordinary
aptitude for learning, and her general intelligence and
amiability of character, had so won upon the affections of
Mrs. Wheatley, that, instead of putting her to the common
household occupations for which she was at first intended,
she kept her about her own person to perform such light
duties as were there required, and which to the grateful
Phillis were rather offices of love than services of mere
mercenary attachment. She soon learned to write as well
as read, and excited the astonishment of all around by her
extraordinary acquirements. How could it be? A poor little
Negro slave, who but a few years ago was running wild
in the African forests—one of an inferior order of beings—
<pb id="adams75" n="75"/>
of a despised, a degraded race! How could it be? Why she
knew more than half the people about her, though they had
white skins and she a black one—they were free and
she in bondage. How could it be? But Phillis astonished them
yet more when, at the early age of fourteen, she began to
write verses, aye, and very polished verses too—highly-
finished compositions, some of which would have done no
discredit to Pope himself, whom she seems to have taken
for her model. It is not often we meet with lines like these
from the pen of a tyro in the art of poesy, however great
have been the advantages offered of moral and intellectual
culture in youth; they are from a long poem on the Providence
of God, remarkable alike for great reach of thought, and
powers of expression:—</p>
            <lg>
              <l>“As reason's powers by day our God disclose,</l>
              <l>So may we trace him in the night's repose.</l>
              <l>Say what is sleep? and dreams, how passing strange!</l>
              <l>When action ceases and ideas range</l>
              <l>Licentious and unbounded o'er the plains,</l>
              <l>Where fancy's queen in giddy triumph reigns.</l>
              <l>Hear in soft strains a dreaming lover sigh</l>
              <l>To a kind fair, and rave in jealousy;</l>
              <l>On pleasure now, and now on vengeance bent,</l>
              <l>The labouring passions struggle for a vent.</l>
              <l>What power, Oh man! thy reason then restores,</l>
              <l>So long suspended in nocturnal hours?</l>
              <l>What secret hand returns the mental train,</l>
              <l>And gives improved thine active powers again?</l>
              <l>From thee, Oh man? what gratitude should rise!</l>
              <l>And when from balmy sleep thou ope'st thine eyes,</l>
              <l>Let thy first thoughts be praises to the skies,</l>
              <l>How merciful our God, who thus imparts</l>
              <l>O'erflowing tides of joy to human hearts,</l>
              <l>When wants and woes might be our righteous lot,</l>
              <l>Our God, forgetting, by our God forgot.”</l>
            </lg>
            <p>“We have no hesitation,” says the author of the tract before
referred to, “in stating our opinion, and we believe that many
will concur in it, that these lines, written by the African slave
girl at the age of fifteen or sixteen, are quite equal to a great
number of the verses that appear in all standard collections of
English poetry under the names of Halifax, Dorset, and others
of ‘the mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease.’ Phillis
Wheatley's lines are, if anything, superior in harmony,
and are not inferior in depth of thought; the faults are
those which characterize the models she copied from.” A less
polished and more natural order of composition might well
have been expected from such a source, and the wonder is how
this young Negro girl could have obtained such a command of
an acquired language, as to express her thoughts in this
elaborate and finished style.</p>
            <pb id="adams76" n="76"/>
            <p>The mistress of Phillis, Mrs. Wheatley, treated her
interesting <sic corr="proteacutegeacutee">protegee</sic> as her own child, and introduced her into
the best society of Boston. Notwithstanding these honours, we
are told that “she never for a moment departed from the
humble and unassuming deportment which distinguished her when
she stood, a little trembling alien, to be sold like a beast of the
field, in the slave-market.” At the age of nineteen, when, in
consequence of her fluctuating and delicate state of health, a sea
voyage had been recommended by her physicians, she came to
England, in company with a son of Mrs. Wheatley, who had
business of a commercial nature in this country. Here she was
well received, and much noticed by those of the higher classes.
An edition of her poems was published, with a portrait attached,
which is said to have exhibited a pleasing countenance and a
highly intellectual formation of head. Mrs. Wheatley, to whom 
a copy of the engraving was transmitted, used to exhibit it with 
great satisfaction to her visitors, exclaiming “See! look at my 
Phillis; does she not seem as if she would speak to me?” The
modest humility of the Negro poetess stood well the severe test
to which it was here subjected; the flattery and attention of the
great and the gifted does not appear to have unbalanced her
well-regulated mind; and when her kind mistress in America
became sick, and expressed a wish to see her gentle attendant
once more, she directly departed for what had ever been to her
a true home; within a short time after her arrival at which, she
had the melancholy satisfaction of soothing the last moments of
her greatest friend and benefactor.</p>
            <p>From this time sorrow seems to have clouded the path of
this gifted young woman. Amid the desolation of her
bereavement she received an offer of marriage from a man
colour, named Peters, which she accepted, probably because
she could by this means secure a home and honourable
protection. Peters was, however, it seems, no vulgar or
ordinary man, being a fluent writer, a ready speaker, and
altogether intelligent and well educated. His great fault was
extreme indolence; this and pride, which prevented his paying
proper attention to his business, which was that of a grocer,
proved his ruin, and caused the misery, and ultimate death, of
his gentle, unrepining wife, and the three infants which she bore
to him. A relative of her late lamented mistress, we are told,
discovered poor Phillis, who had long been lost sight of, in a
state of absolute want; two of her children were dead, and the
third was dying by the side of its then
<pb id="adams77" n="77"/>
perishing mother, who soon closed her eyes for ever upon
cares and sorrows of this world.</p>
            <p>“Thus perished a woman who, by a fortunate accident, was
rescued from the degraded condition to which those of her race
who are brought to the slave-market are too often
condemned, as if for the purpose of showing to the world what
care and education could effect, in elevating the character of the
benighted Africans. The example is sufficient to impress us
with the conviction, that, out of the countless millions to
whom no similar opportunities have been presented, many
might be found fitted by the endowments of nature, and
wanting only the blessings of education, to make them
ornaments, like Phillis Wheatley, not only to their race, but to
humanity.”<ref id="ref11" n="11" rend="sc" target="note11" targOrder="U">* </ref></p>

          <div3 type="subchapter">
            <head>THOMAS JENKINS</head>
            <p>was the son of an African king, and unmistakeably a Negro,
having, fully developed, all the physical peculiarities of the
race. His father reigned over a considerable tract of country
on the coast of Guinea, which was much resorted to by
dealers in slaves. King Cock-eye, as the sailors called the
Negro sovereign, on account of his obliquity of vision, having
noticed that the superior intelligence of the Europeans gave
them great advantage over the Africans in their traffic, resolved
to send his son to Britain, which he had been informed
was the focus of enlightenment, for education. Accordingly
the young prince was formally consigned to the care of a
British trader, who promised to return him some years
afterwards, with as much learning in his head as it could:
conveniently carry; but death prevented the fulfilment of
this promise. The captain died suddenly soon after his return
to England, and before the necessary arrangements for the
commencement of the education of his charge could be made;
so Thomas Jenkins, as his guardian had somewhat capriciously
chosen to call him, was left without a friend in a strange
land.</p>
            <p>It was at an inn in Hawick, a town in Scotland, that
poor Tom watched by the death-bed of Captain Swanstone, 
and faithfully performed for him the necessary duties, although
almost perishing with the cold of a northern winter; and 
there he remained awhile, after his guardian had expired,
<pb id="adams78" n="78"/>
doing what he could to make himself useful, and to show his
gratitude for the food, and lodging, and kind treatment of the
landlady of the house. He was then taken charge of by a farmer
of Teviot-head, who was a near relative of his deceased guardian,
and employed in such. humble duties about the house and farm
as he was able to perform. After awhile he was advanced to the
office of cow-herd, and driver of peats to Hawick for sale, and
discharged these duties in a very satisfactory manner. His next
change was into the service of Mr. Laidlaw, of Falnash, a
respectable and intelligent gentleman, who took a fancy to Black
Tom, as he was called, and prevailed on his former protector to
relinquish the charge of him. He was now a stout lad, and could
turn his hand to almost anything; he spoke the provincial dialect
like a native, and, but for his sable skin, woolly hair, and Negro
features, might have been taken for a Scottish peasant.</p>
            <p>Now it was that Tom began to show some taste for
snatching up very eagerly all the crumbs of knowledge 
that came within his reach. It was observed that
he had a strange liking for candle ends, carefully preserving
every scrap of wick and tallow that was left about the
farm-house. Suspicions were aroused, the boy was watched,
and in his loft was seen with books and slate, employing
the hours usually devoted to rest, in making rude imitations
of the letters of the alphabet. The liberal-minded Mr.
Laidlaw did not discourage these attempts of the poor lad
to acquire knowledge; on the contrary, he sent him to an
evening school kept by a rustic pedagogue, where he made
such rapid progress as to astonish all the neighbourhood.
Not content with English, and the mere elementary branches
of knowledge, this farm servant, by and by, in the intervals of
his daily toil, began to instruct himself in Latin and Greek. In
the rural district where he lived, no regular instruction in the
classics could be obtained; but the Laidlaws, and other kind
friends, lent him some books, and did all they could to
encourage and assist his praiseworthy efforts; which were so far
successful, that he obtained a tolerable acquaintance with the
two ancient languages named, and something of an insight into
mathematics. With twelve shillings, saved out of his wages, and
a little assistance from a friend, he was enabled to purchase a
Greek Dictionary. This was a great event in Tom's life; Oh, what
a prize was that dictionary to him! How triumphantly did he bear
it from the auction, where we are told that “All present
<pb id="adams79" n="79"/>
stared with wonder when they saw a Negro, clad in the grey
cast-off surtout of a private soldier, and the No. xcvi. still
glaring in white oil paint on his back, competing for a book,
which could only be useful to a student in a considerably
advanced stage.”</p>
            <p>And equally astonished, a few years later, were the members
of the “Committee of the Presbytery of Jedburgh, ” appointed 
to examine the qualifications of the candidates for the 
mastership of the school of Teviot-head, when the same black
farm-servant of Falnash appeared before them, clad in the same
serviceable coat, with a bundle of books under his arm, to be
examined as to his fitness for the work of instructing
the bare-breeched callants of the wide mountain district around.
Tom's qualifications were undoubtedly superior to any other of
the candidates; but then his black skin! How could the <sic corr="good">gude</sic> folk
of the presbytery entrust their children to the care of such as he?
Tom lost his election, because he could not , when improving his
mind, also whiten his body, and assimilate his features more
nearly to the lines of Celtic beauty. Our hero, who was then
twenty years of age, felt keenly the disappointment of this rejection
on account of caste and colour—it seemed to dam for ever the
current of his hopes of further advancement, and condemn
him to a life of lasting servitude.</p>
            <p>But there were some in the district who had enlightened
views, and they, feeling indignant at Tom's rejection, resolved
to set him up in opposition to the chosen of the presbytery.
Several of the heritors therefore, headed by the then Duke of
Buccleuch, fitted up for the Negro schoolmaster an old
<hi rend="italics">smiddy</hi>, and engaged to pay him an annual stipend, equal
to that of his more regularly appointed rival. Tom turned
out an excellent teacher, and became an immense favourite with
both parents and children; he had a way of communicating
knowledge, which rendered severity unnecessary; his school
was soon filled, while the other was deserted, and matters
went on swimmingly. He was both learner and teacher, and
every Saturday used to walk to Hawick, a distance of 
eight miles, to make an exhibition to the master of an academy
there, of what he had himself acquired during the week. On
Sunday he was always back to divine service at his parish
church, of which he was a regular attendant.</p>
            <p>But Oh, the ambition of man! Tom sighed for academical
honours; and having obtained a person to perform his school
duties, and leave from his patrons, the heritors, to be absent
during the requisite period, he presented himself, when
<pb id="adams80" n="80"/>
the winter session was about to commence, at the Edinburgh
University, in the identical grey coat before spoken of, and
requested admission to the Latin, Greek, and mathematical
classes; much to the astonishment of the professors, two
of whom, to their honour be it spoken, would not accept
of the fees which he tendered, out of the twenty pounds
which he had managed to save, and which constituted his
whole stock of money. A gentleman named Moncrieff,
however, an old and steady friend of Tom, had given him
an order upon a merchant of Edinburgh, for whatever
further sum he might require to support him at college
during the winter. Tom fully justified the confidence 
reposed in him, and returned this order unused, when he
resumed his school duties at Teviot-head in the spring.</p>
            <p>We give the conclusion to his history in the words of the
tract, from which we have gleaned these particulars:—“It is
obvious, we think, that Mr. Jenkins should have been
returned, by some benevolent society, to his native country;
where he might have been expected to do wonders in civilizing
and instructing his father's or his own subjects. Unfortunately,
about ten years ago, a gentleman of the neighbourhood,
animated by the best intentions, introduced him to the Christian
Knowledge Society, as a proper person to be a Missionary among
the colonial slaves; and he was induced to go out as a teacher
to the Mauritius—a scene entirely unworthy of his exertions.
There he has attained eminence as a teacher, and we believe he
is still living.”</p>

            <head>LOTT CARY</head>
            <p>was another self-taught African, who exhibited powers and
capacities of mind, and qualities of heart and understanding,
which fully entitle him to a place in our gallery of Negro
worthies. He was the only child of slave parents, and a native
of Virginia state, being born on a plantation about thirty miles
from the town of Richmond; at which town we find him in
1804, employed at a warehouse as a common labourer. His
parents were seriously disposed, although uneducated
people, and appear to have sown in his mind the seeds of
piety, which received a quickening impulse from a sermon
which he heard, while employed at the warehouse. He
procured a copy of the New Testament, and by dint of 
perseverance, after awhile, taught himself to read; making
himself at the same time acquainted with the religious truths
<pb id="adams81" n="81"/>
contained in that precious book. He next managed to acquire
the art of writing, and these acquisitions, by rendering him
more useful to his employers, tended to raise him greatly
in the scale of remuneration; so that with diligence 
and frugality, he was enabled, eventually, to save a sum
sufficient to purchase his own freedom, and that of two
children born to him by a bond woman on his master's
estate, whom he had married and lost by death.</p>
            <p>At Richmond, Cary was chiefly employed in shipping
tobacco. “Of the real value of his services, while in this
employment,” says the author of an American Publication,
from whence the particulars given in Chamber's Tract are
gathered, “it has been remarked that no one but a dealer tobacco
can form an idea. Notwithstanding the hundreds
of hogsheads which were committed to his charge, he could
produce any one the moment it was called for; and the
shipments were made with a promptness and correctness
such as no person, either white or coloured, has equalled in
the same situation.”</p>
            <p>Cary's employers, it seems, were not slow to acknowledge
and reward his valuable services. In addition to his regular
salary which at last amounted to eight hundred dollars 
yearly, they frequently presented him with a five dollar note,
besides allowing him to sell for his own benefit small parcels
of damaged tobacco occasionally. He employed much of his
leisure time in reading, and his books, when not of a religious
character, were such solid works as “Smith's Wealth of
Nations,” and the like.</p>
            <p>As early as 1815, the subject of African Missions had
occupied the mind of this self-emancipated, and self-educated
Negro, and it was mainly through his efforts, that the African
Missionary Society was established, at Richmond, in that
year. He, too, was among the earliest of the emigrant colonists,
whose object was to introduce civilization and
Christianity among the barbarous tribes, among whom his 
ancestors were to be looked for. The settlement at Cape
Montserado was formed in the face of appalling difficulties, and
Cary appears to have been the leading spirit in its foundation,
protection, and management. “Here he saw before him
a wide and interesting field, demanding various and powerful
talents, and the most devoted piety. His intellectual ability,
firmness of purpose, unbending integrity, correct judgment
and disinterested benevolence, soon placed him in a 
conspicuous station, and gave him wide and commanding influence.”<ref id="ref12" n="12" rend="sc" target="note12" targOrder="U">* </ref></p>

            <pb id="adams82" n="82"/>
            <p>It is to be deeply deplored that the means which this
devoted man employed for the defence of the colony, were not
such as true Christianity would sanction. He trusted rather to
the arm of fleshly power, than to that of Divine Providence and
the consequence was his death by the ignition of some loose
powder, causing the explosion of a large stock of ammunition,
during the preparation of cartridges, to resist an expected attack
from slave dealers. Previous to this event, which occurred in
1828, he had been made vice-agent of the colony; for which he
also for a long time acted as chief physician, having made
himself acquainted with the diseases of the climate, and their
remedies, for this purpose.</p>
            <p>“On the coast of Africa,” again to quote our authority, “the
memory of this coloured apostle of civilization will long
continue to be cherished. The career which he pursued, and the
intelligence which marked his character, might prove to the
satisfaction of all impartial thinkers, that the miserable race of
Blacks is not destitute of moral worth and innate genius; and that
their culture would liberally produce an abundant harvest of the
best principles, and their results which dignify human
nature.”</p>

            <head>PAUL CUFFEE.</head>
            <p>WITHOUT pretending to claim for the subject of the present
sketch a very high place in the scale of intellectual endowment,
we may adduce him as an example of great mental
energy, perseverance, and enterprise. Few white men have ever
struggled with, and overcome greater difficulties than Paul
Cuffee, whose career is instructive, not only as showing that
there is no inherent defect or weakness in the Negro mind, but
also as an example of what may be done by a determined will
and sound judgment, to ensure worldly prosperity, and assist
our fellow-creatures, even with scanty means and limited
opportunities.</p>
            <p>Paul was the fourth son of a native African, who, having
been brought as a slave to Boston, was enabled, by great
industry and economy, to save a sufficient sum to purchase,
first his freedom, and then a farm of one hundred acres, which
was situated at Westport, in Massachusetts. He married a
woman of Indian descent, by whom he had a family of ten
children. The date of Paul's birth is 1759, and in 1773
<pb id="adams83" n="83"/>
his father died, and after assisting his brothers for awhile
in the cultivation of their land, which was not very productive,
he resolved to forsake agriculture for commerce, and to cast
in his lot with those who “go down to the sea in ships, and
do their business upon the mighty waters.” His first voyage
was a whaling expedition; his second a trip to the West
Indies; and in both of these he served as a common sailor
before the mast. In the year 1776, when Britain and America
were at war, he set out on his third voyage, and had the
misfortune to be taken prisoner and carried to New York,
where he was detained three months. At the end of that
time, being released, he returned to Westport, and there
remained for several years, occupied in his old pursuits. It
was at this time, while he was yet under the age of twenty,
that Paul, who, we are told, felt deeply the injustice done
to his race by their exclusion from the rights of citizenship,
resolved on making an effort to obtain those rights, and
accordingly drew up, with the assistance of his brothers, and
presented to the state legislature, a petition on the subject,
which had the desired effect, and procured for the free
Negroes of this state all the privileges of white citizens, and
not of this alone, for others soon followed the example of
Massachusetts, and thus Paul Cuffee became a benefactor to
the whole coloured population of North America.</p>
            <p>When about twenty years old, the idea of opening a
commercial intercourse with the state of Connecticut occurred
to Paul, and his brother David having consented to join him
in the venture, the two set out in an open boat, which was all
their limited means would allow them to procure. The perils of
the voyage in this small vessel discouraged the elder
brother, who was quite unaccustomed to the sea, and he greatly
disappointed Paul by resolving to return and abandon the
enterprise. By dint of hard labour and strict economy, the
more fearless brother, after awhile, was enabled to purchase a
boat for himself; in this he embarked; but the fates were
unpropitious, and Paul lost the whole of his hard-earned
treasures. Again he set to work, and again saved some money
and buying only the materials, constructed a boat with his own
hands. Behold him now in his deckless vessel once more
launched on the treacherous sea, steering for the Elizabeth
Isles, to consult one of his brothers residing there, as to his
future plans. He is beset by pirates, who take his boat and its
contents, and send him back to Westport a penniless, but not a
disheartened man. With the help of David , he constructs yet
another boat, and having now gained
<pb id="adams84" n="84"/>
a character for energy and trustworthiness, he obtains a
cargo on credit, which, after a narrow escape from the pirates,
he lands safely at Nantucket, and there disposes of it to
advantage. He returns, and again ventures forth upon the
waters with another cargo, which is seized by his old enemies,
who this time do not deprive him of his boat. Nothing daunted,
Paul loads her again, sets sail, and this time succeeds in reaching
the destined port without casualties. The profits of this voyage
enable him to purchase a decked vessel of twelve tons burden,
with which he made several successful voyages to the
Connecticut coasts, so that he became a man of some substance,
and now thought that he might venture upon taking a wife. He
chose a descendant of the same tribe of Indians as that to
which his mother belonged, and for some years after his
marriage remained on shore, engaged in agriculture. The
wants of an increasing family again sent him forth upon
the sea; with a larger vessel than he had yet possessed,
he engaged in cod-fishing and thus increased his means so much,
as to be enabled to build a brig of forty-two tons burden which
was navigated by himself and several nephews, who had also
become sailors.</p>
            <p>Paul now began to be looked up to as a leading man in his
community, and to interest himself about the mental
improvement of the people around him, who were chiefly
mariners and fishermen, who depended greatly upon him for
the means of support. He was himself, in a great measure, an
uneducated man, and feeling the want of education, was
desirous that others should not be so deprived of its
advantages; he therefore built a school-house on his own ground,
and threw it open to the public. Still increasing in prosperity
as years rolled on, he became owner of several ships, in one
of which he came to England in the year 1811, and made
a very favourable impression upon all with whom he had
intercourse. In the “Liverpool Mercury” published at the
time of his visit, there appeared a memoir of him, from which
we quote the following description of his mental and physical
characteristics:—“A sound understanding, united with
indomitable energy and perseverance, are the prominent features
of Paul Cuffee's character. Born under peculiar disadvantages,
deprived of the benefits of early education, and his meridian
spent in toil and vicissitudes, he has struggled under disadvantages
which have seldom occurred in the career of any individual.
Yet, under the pressure of these difficulties, he seems to have
fostered dispositions of mind which qualify him for any
station of life to which he is introduced. His person
<pb id="adams85" n="85"/>
is tall, well-formed, and athletic; his deportment conciliating,
yet dignified and serene. His prudence, strengthened by
parental care and example, no doubt guarded him in his
youth, when exposed to the dissolute company which
unavoidably attends a seafaring life; whilst religion, influencing
his mind by its secret guidance in silent reflection, has in advancing
manhood added to the brightness of his character, and
instituted or confirmed his disposition to practical good.
Latterly he made application and was received into
membership with the respectable Society of Friends.”</p>
            <p>As a proof of the disposition for practical good here spoken
of, it may be mentioned, that the scheme of establishing
colonies of free Blacks on the coast of Africa excited in him
the deepest interest. He visited in person the parts proposed
for colonization, and it was while he was at Sierra Leone
for this purpose, in 1811, that he was induced by the agents of
the British African Institute to determine on visiting England,
with a cargo of African produce. His brig, navigated by eight
men and a boy, all Negroes, excited a great deal of attention on
reaching Liverpool, and he himself obtained much notice and
respect from men of all classes. He had left his nephew behind
him at Sierra Leone, to prosecute his benevolent inquiries, and
had brought away a native youth, in order to educate and fit him
for a teacher of his benighted brethren. To the council of the African
Institute, who consulted him as to the best method of carrying
out their philanthropic views, he imparted valuable
information and advice, and, after visiting London twice, he
returned to America, to spend the remainder of his days in the
enjoyment of that competency which he had so well earned, and
which enabled him to obey the promptings of his warm and generous
heart. Of the date of his death we have no record: most of the
members of his family are still, we believe, engaged in those
commercial pursuits in which he was so enterprising and successful.</p>

            <head>THE AMISTAD CAPTIVES.</head>
            <p>A GREAT deal of excitement was caused in the United States,
in the year 1839, by the seizure, by a government
ship, of a suspicious-looking schooner, manned by about
forty Africans; this turned out to be the Amistad, a Spanish vessel,
into which the Negroes, previously brought from their own
<pb id="adams86" n="86"/>
country and sold as slaves, had been put at Havannah by their
purchasers, two Spaniards, to be conveyed to Cuba, where the
estates of their masters were situated. On the passage
they overpowered the captain and crew of the vessel, killing part
of them in the struggle; put their would-be owners into
confinement; and in the attempt to effect their escape back to
Africa, were captured by the American cruiser and brought
into port. The Spaniards, Jose Ruiz and Pedro Montez, who
claimed them for their property, had them indicted for piracy
and murder, but the indictment was declared not recognizable in
an American court; the alleged offence having been committed in
a vessel under the Spanish flag. The reputed culprits were,
however, kept in confinement, although great efforts were
made by the friends of the Negro to obtain their release; and it
was finally decided by the senate at Washington, to deliver
them up, either as property or murderers. The order, however,
to this effect, was disregarded; the judge of the district in which
they were confined, deciding that they were free men,
unlawfully kidnapped in Africa, and therefore entitled to their
liberty: they were accordingly released from confinement.
Many persons volunteered their assistance to these homeless
and destitute, Negroes, they were taken by the hand by the
friends of emancipation, and their wants and wishes made known
to the public, by means of interesting exhibitions of native manners
and customs, etc., in which they appeared, and related their history
and adventures.</p>
            <p>Cinque, as their leader was called, appears to have been a
man of great intelligence, and natural ability; he was a powerful
orator, and although speaking in a tongue foreign to his
audience, by the grace and energy of his motions and attitudes,
the changeful expression of his features, and the intonations
of his voice, made them understand the main incidents
of his narrative, and swayed their minds in an extraordinary
manner. Alluding to that point of his history at which Cinque
described how, when on board the Spanish vessel, he, with the
help of a nail, first relieved himself of his manacles, then assisted
his countrymen to get rid of theirs, and then led them to the attack
of the Spaniards, Lewis Tappan, in the account of the whole
proceedings connected with these Amistad captives, which he
published, says—“It is not in my power to give an adequate
description of Cinque  when he showed how he did this, and led his
comrades to the conflict, and achieved their freedom. In my
younger years I have seen Kemble and Siddons, and the
<pb id="adams87" n="87"/>
representation of ‘Othello,’at Covent Garden; but no acting
that I have ever witnessed, came near that to which I allude.”</p>
            <p>Many other members of this interesting group of Africans,
exhibited proofs of great mental capabilities; one in particular,
named Kali a boy of eleven years old, who astonished his
auditors by the readiness with which he learned and repeated
words and sentences in the English language, with which he
could have had no previous acquaintance. In this language, most
of them were enabled to address an audience after they had
been in America a very short time. The leading truths of
Christianity, which were presented to their minds now, for the
first time, they seemed to comprehend with astonishing
quickness. One of them, on being asked “What is faith?”
replied, “Believing in Jesus Christ, and trusting in him.”
Another said, “We owe everything to God; He keeps us alive,
and makes us free; when we go home to Mundi, we will tell
our brethren about God, Jesus Christ, and heaven.” And home
to Mundi, to which country the greater part of them belonged,
after a lapse of about three years, from the time of their being
brought into New Haven, they did go; a sufficient sum having
being raised to charter a ship for their conveyance, and furnish
the necessary means for their subsistence, and that of five
white missionaries and teachers who accompanied them. They
were landed at Sierra Leone, and the British authorities there
afforded them every facility for reaching their native country;
on the borders of which it was proposed to form a Missionary
station or settlement, from whence the light of the blessed
Gospel might be gradually introduced into the dark interior.</p>
            <p>The Mundians, we learn, are an exceedingly warlike tribe,
much given to slave hunting an other abominations. They do
not appear, however, to be idolators; and it is a singular fact
that they abstain from labour one day in every seven, and
have so from time immemorial; they have no religious
observance on that day, but their sabbath observance, if we
may so call it, consists in dressing, and feasting, and taking
their pleasure; pretty much as many nominal Christians do<corr sic="missing period">.</corr></p>

            <head>IGNATIUS SANCHO.</head>
            <p>THIS is the next intelligent Negro whom we find included in
the tract before us; he was born at what date we do
<pb id="adams88" n="88"/>
not learn, on board a slave vessel bound for Carthagena, in South
America, his father and mother being destined for the slave-market
of that place, shortly after their arrival at which, the child
lost both its parents, the one dying and the other committing
suicide in despair. The little black orphan was carried
to England and presented by his master to three maiden sisters
resident at Greenwich, in whose service he appears to have
remained until their death broke up the establishment, when
Sancho, who had earned this name, it seems, by his drollery and
humour, was taken by the Duchess of Montague in the capacity
of butler, so that altogether, his lines appear to have fallen in
pleasant places. When the Duchess died, she left her Negro butler
an annuity of thirty pounds, and this, with a considerable sum
which he had saved out of his salary, ought to have made him
pretty comfortable for life. But Sancho had the reputation of a wit
and a humourist, which has proved fatal to many, and he led for
awhile the life of a man about town, haunting the tavern and the
green room of the theatre, and living beyond his means. He had
quite a passion for theatrical representations, and was a great
admirer of Garrick, who took much notice of him. It was at one
time proposed that he should go upon the stage to perform
Negro characters, but this project lad to be abandoned, on account
of his imperfect articulation.</p>
            <p>After awhile he sobered down somewhat, married an interesting
West Indian girl, got a family about him, and lived a more
regular life. He still, however, kept up his acquaintance with
many of his former friends, some of whom were of the higher
classes; his letters to these and others, after his death, were
published in two volumes, with a portrait of the author. Several of
them are on the subject of Negro slavery, for the abolition of
which Sancho was, during a good part of his life, an earnest and
effectual advocate; he seemed to feel deeply the wrongs and
sufferings of his coloured brethren, and omitted no opportunity of
pleading their cause. There is a letter of his to Sterne on this
subject, which elicited a very characteristic reply; we would fain
quote both letter and answer but our limited space will not admit
of this; our readers will find both in the tract to which we have
frequently referred. It only remains to add that about the latter
end of the last century was the period of Ignatius Sancho's most
active exertions in behalf of his enslaved countrymen.</p>

            <head>ZHINGA.</head>
            <p>THIS was a Negro Queen of Angola, who flourished in the
sixteenth century, at a time when the Portuguese were settling as
planters and traders on the African coast, and making great
encroachments upon the territories of the native chiefs. In this
Negress we have power of mind and strength of character
developed, as well as acuteness of intellect. The more lofty and
refined of the mental qualities were scarcely to be looked for in
one who, although surrounded with the pomp of barbaric
splendour, was never brought under the influence of true
civilization. This African queen rendered herself famous by acts
of daring, and a carriage and deportment at all times marked with
a kind of rude imperial dignity. She was proud, imperious, cruel,
and unscrupulous; yet does she in some way command our respect
for a certain magnanimity of character, which, if she had been
properly trained and instructed—<hi rend="italics">Christianized</hi>, would
have in made her truly great. Sent, when about forty years
of age, by her brother the King of Angola, to Loanda, the
seat of the Portuguese viceroy, she was received with the
honours due to her rank; but the proud ambassadress was
offended, on entering the presence chamber, by perceiving
that the seat prepared for her, although rich with gold and
velvet, was on the floor, while that of the viceregent, with
whom she came to treat, was elevated on a magnificent chair of
state: disdaining the costly cushion on account of its lowly place,
she gave a sign to one of her attendant women, who immediately
knelt down, supporting herself on her hands and knees, and
supporting, too, during the whole of the interview, the weight of
her imperious mistress, who chose this strange way of vindicating
her right to be considered on an equality with the representative
of the foreign king. When Zhinga arose from her living throne,
and was leaving the presence hand-in-hand with the viceroy, he
remarked that her attendant still remained kneeling. “I have no
<sic corr="further">frather</sic> use for the woman. It is not fit that the ambassadress of a
great king should be twice served with the same seat,” was the
haughty reply.</p>
            <p>Zhinga remained awhile at Loanda, and there pretended to
embrace Christianity, being baptized, and conforming somewhat
to European customs. It is plain, however, that of vital
Christianity she was quite ignorant, for shortly after, her brother
having died, she ascended the throne of Angola, and had her
nephew strangled to make sure of the succession.
<pb id="adams90" n="90"/>
She then became involved in a war with the Portuguese which,
assisted by the Dutch and some native chiefs, she carried on
for a time most vigorously, but was eventually defeated, and
refusing the proffered retention of her throne on the condition
of paying an annual tribute to the conquerors, was obliged to
flee for her life, while her kingdom was give to another.
Throwing off her Christianity as easily as a loose garment
because it was the religion of her enemies, she rallied around her
a band of faithful Negroes, and for eighteen years did she defy
and harass the Portuguese, demanding the unconditional restoration
of her throne. Advancing age, however, brought its weaknesses, 
its regrets, its desires for rest and reconciliation, even to this proud
woman, whose heart was softened by affliction, which visited her in the
death of a beloved sister. After the storm and the whirlwind
came the still small voice; she was haunted by remorse on
account of her apostacy from the Christian faith, and was
persuaded by some Portuguese priests, whom she had taken
prisoners, again to declare herself a convert thereto. This
led to her restoration to power, which on the whole she
exercised with discretion, and as much clemency as could be
expected from one used to absolute and despotic away. She
propagated her new religion among her subjects, martyring,
as has been the fashion with “Most Christian” monarchs,
some who refused to receive it. She passed several salutary
laws, one forbidding polygamy, another abolishing human
sacrifices; her treaties with the Portuguese she faithfully
observed, but never would acknowledge their supremacy—
never would allow herself to be called the vassal of any
power. She died in 1663, aged eighty-two, having
up to this period retained her bodily strength and mental
vigour. In any age and country she must have been considered a 
woman of remarkable powers.</p>

            <head>PLACEDO.</head>
            <p>WHENEVER an anti-slavery martyrology is written, as one
day we hope it will be, Placedo, the Cuban Poet, will
assuredly have a place therein. This Negro, whose real name
was Gabriel de la Concepcion Valdes, was executed at
Havannah, in July, 1844, with several other persons, for inciting
the slaves to revolt against their Spanish masters,
<pb id="adams91" n="91"/>
who had perpetrated on them the most horrible cruelties,
and rendered their yoke unbearably galling.</p>
            <p>But few particulars appear to be known of the life of
Placedo, previous to his appearance at the place of execution,
where his manly and heroic bearing excited the sympathy and
admiration of all who saw him. He walked to the fatal spot
with as much calmness as if it had been to some ordinary
resort of business or pleasure; reciting, as he went, a beautiful
hymn, which he had composed on the previous night in prison.
When arrived there, he sat down as directed, to await the
necessary preparations; which being made, he arose, and
turning to the shrinking soldiers, his face wearing an expression
of almost superhuman courage, he said in Spanish, “Adieu, O
world; here is no pity for me. Soldiers, fire!” Five balls entered
his body, but did not deprive him of life. Still unsubdued, again
he spoke, pointing to his breast, and saying “Here, fire here!”
Two more balls then entered his breast and he fell dead.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italics">Heraldo,</hi> a Madrid paper, in giving in account of his
execution, speaks of him as the celebrated Cuban Poet, and
says “This man was born with great natural genius, and was
beloved and appreciated by the most respectable young men of
Havannah, who united to purchase his release from slavery.”
Some years ago, a volume of “Poems by a Cuban slave,” whose
name for ‘certain reasons’ the translator did not deem it
advisable to append, was published in this country; and it is
now generally believed that these poems were by Placedo. Dr.
Madden, who edited the volume, stated that the poems, with
which was a memoir of the author, written by himself, were
placed in his hands by a gentleman of Havannah, in 1838; at
which time it is probable that the purchased release from
slavery of Placedo, spoken of in the <hi rend="italics">Heraldo</hi>, had not taken
place. Many interesting particulars are given in the memoir,
which, if we were sure they referred to Placedo we might be
tempted to quote; they exhibit a frightful picture of Negro
slavery in Cuba, and leave us no room to wonder at any efforts
which might be made by the unfortunate Africans to free
themselves.</p>
            <p>The poems display a very high order of intellect, and are prefaced
by Madden these remarks:—“I am sensible that I have not done
justice to these poems, but I trust that I have done enough to
vindicate, in some degree, the character of Negro intellect; at
least the attempt affords me the opportunity of recording my
conviction, that the blessings of education and good
government are alone wanting
<pb id="adams92" n="92"/>
to make the natives of Africa, intellectually and morally, equal
to the people of any nation on the surface of the globe.”</p>
            <p>We cannot more fitly conclude this chapter than with the
hymn composed by Placedo on the night previous to his
execution, and recited as he walked to the place of death.
Several translations of this hymn have been given; the following
is perhaps as close to the original as any; it appeared in the
“Anti-Slavery Reporter,” for Sept. 6th., 1844, with the initials A P.

          <p>IT appears to be quite forgotten by those who contend for the
inferiority of the Negro race, that Africa was once the nursery of
science and literature; the fountain head from whence copious
streams of learning and civilization flowed forth to other parts
of the world. It is asserted by some writers, that the ancient
Greeks represented their goddess of wisdom, Minerva, as a Negro
princess; and certain it is that Solon, Plato, Pythagoras, and
others of their master spirits, made pilgrimages into Africa, in
search of knowledge. Three hundred years before the 
commencement of the Christian Era, one Euclid, a dark-skinned teacher,
was at the head of the most celebrated mathematical school in
the world; and that same Negro still continues to teach in our
schools; possibly his name may be familiar to some, even in
Georgia and South Carolina, who would think it a degradation to
sit in the same pew at church with one of his thick-lipped
countrymen. They should remember, however, that the words of
wisdom have been uttered by thick lips as well as thin ones; and
that the light of intellect has often illumined a face black as ever
burned in the suns of Ethiopia, that land which we are told in the
language of unerring truth, shall “soon stretch out her hands unto
God.”</p>
          <p>Ye who would bar the doors of schools and colleges against the
African thirsting for knowledge, and assign him a place of
inferiority in your churches, think of the great repositories
of learning, and the gorgeous temples which once adorned
the land of his fathers, when she was the seat of a mighty
empire able to contend with Rome for the sovereignty
of the world. Has not Africa been called the cradle of
the primitive church? was she not the asylum of the infant
<pb id="adams94" n="94"/>
Saviour? Do not such names as Origen, Tertullian, Augustine,
Clemens Alexandrinus, and Cyril put to shame the worldly wisdom
of those pastors and teachers, (blind guides surely!) who strive to
reconcile christian fellowship with the holding of a brother in
bondage, and quote precedents for Negro slavery out of the
Mosaic law, forgetting what the Apostle hath said, that
“love is the fulfilling of the law.” In the words of
Wilson Armistead, let us ask, “Can the enlightened
Negrophobists of America tell us why these tawny bishops of
Africa, of apostolic renown, were not colonized into a <hi rend="italics">Negro
pew</hi> when attending the ecclesiastical councils of their day?
and, how they reconcile their actions with the example of the
Evangelist Philip, who, in compliance with the intimation of the
Spirit, went and joined the Ethiopian in his chariot, preached to
him the gospel of Christ, and baptized him in His Name?”<ref id="ref13" n="13" rend="sc" target="note13" targOrder="U">* </ref></p>
          <p>Great in his way was Hannibal, the Carthagenian; and great in
his, the African poet Terrence, the friend and associate of
Hannibal's conqueror. Science, learning, religion, war, poetry,
have here their Negro representatives; the list of famous names
might be greatly increased, were it desirable. What more then is
required to prove the fallacy of the opinion, or of the assertion,
not at all times as we may well believe, founded in a sincere
belief, of Negro inferiority? Surely nothing, it may be replied,
except to show that these great names that you have mentioned,
really belonged to Negroes.</p>
          <p>It is the generally received opinion of the most eminent
historians and ethnologists, that the Ethiopians were really
Negroes, although in them the physical characteristics of the
race were exhibited in a less marked manner than in those
dwelling on the coast of Guinea, from whence the stock of
American slaves has been chiefly derived. That in the earliest
periods of history the Ethiopians had attained a high degree of
civilization, there is every reason to believe; and that to the
learning and science derived from them we must ascribe those
wonderful monuments which still exist to attest the power and
skill of the Ancient Egyptians, whose physical history is
involved in considerable doubt. The opinion of those who
would assign to this remarkable people a Negro origin, is much
strengthened by the testimony of Herodotus, who states that they
were “woolly-haired blacks with projecting lips.” Now
Herodotus travelled
<note id="note13" n="13" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref13">*  Tribute for the Negro, p. 121</note>
<pb id="adams95" n="95"/>
Egypt and was well acquainted, from personal observation,
with the appearance of the people. Other writers concur in
this testimony, and Volney considers the evidence on this
point too strong to be refuted. Dr. Prichard considers that the
Ancient Egyptians were certainly marked with the Negro
characteristics; and although it can scarcely be asserted that
they were like the Ethiopians—decidedly black, they were
undoubtedly of a very dark complexion, as were the Copts, their
descendants, and as are, though in a less degree, the Egyptians
of the present day. A slight glance at the statue of the Memnon
and other sculptures, in which the human face appears, will
serve to shew that there was at least a great similarity between
the features of those who were of old dwellers by the mysterious
Nile, and those whom we now call Negroes.</p>
          <p>History informs us that Egypt and Ethiopia were originally
and contemporaneously peopled by the brothers Misraim
and Cush, and that they were long confederately governed; and
in proof of the truth of this, Herodotus states that down to the
time at which he wrote, eighteen out of the list of Egyptian
sovereigns recorded, had been Ethiopians. From these two
streams it is at least probable that the whole of Africa was
peopled; and who shall say that she has not, despised and
degraded as she is, a noble array of great names wherewith to
emblazon her heraldry? Her present inhabitants, to use the
words of the pious Richard Watson, are the “offshoots—wild
and untrained it is true, but still the offshoots of a stem which
was once proudly luxuriant in the fruits of learning and taste;
whilst that from which the Goths, their calumniators, have sprung,
remained hard, and knotted, and barren.”</p>
          <p>Not, however, to rest one plea for the admission of Africa,
or rather the Negro race, into the brotherhood of intellectual
equality, upon what some may consider doubtful
grounds, let us adduce a few examples, in addition to those
given in the previous chapters, of persons of unquestionable
Negro origin, who have exhibited great or good qualities or
capacities. A mere catalogue is all that our limited space will
allow us to give, and this we quote almost verbatim from
Armistead's volume, to which we have so frequently
had occasion to allude. We omit the reference to authorities,
which are in all cases given, and shew that the author must
have taken great pains to verify his statements. We also omit
those names to which we have made a previous reference.</p>
          <pb id="adams96" n="96"/>
          <p>Among the Turks, Negroes have sometimes arrived at the most
eminent offices<sic corr=".">,</sic> Different writers have given the same account of
Keslar Aga, who in 1730, was chief of the black eunuchs of the
Porte; he is described as a man of great wisdom and profound
knowledge.</p>
          <p>In 1765, the English papers cited, as a remarkable event, the
ordination of a Negro by Dr. Keppel, Bishop of Exeter. Among
the Spaniards and Portuguese, such an event is of common
occurrence. The history of Cingo gives an account of a black
bishop who studied at Rome. Corria de Serra, a secretary of the
Academy of Portugal, informs us that several Negroes have been
learned lawyers, preachers, and professors; and that many of these
in the Portuguese possessions have been signalized by their talent.
In 1717, the Negro Don Juan Latino, taught the Latin language at
Seville. He lived to the age of one hundred and seventeen.</p>
          <p>An African prince, and many young Africans of quality, sent
into Portugal in the time of king Immanuel, were distinguished
at the universities, and some of them were promoted to the
priesthood. Near the close of the seventeenth century, Admiral du
Quesne, saw at the Cape Verd Islands, a catholic clergy, all
Negroes, with the exception of two, the bishop and curate of St.
Jago.</p>
          <p>According to the statements of Leo Africanus, who visited
the city of Timbuctoo, on the Niger, in the sixteenth
century, the progress of learning must have been considerable
in its locality at that period. “In this city,” observes
Leo, “there are a great number of judges, of teachers, and
of <hi rend="italics">very learned men</hi>, who, are amply supported by royal
bounty. An infinite quantity of manuscript books are
brought hither from Barbary; and much more money is
derived from the traffic in these than in all the other
articles of merchandise.” As if to guard us against giving
the Moors the credit of this, Leo makes especial mention
of the king's brother, with whom he was well acquainted;
this was Abubuker, surnamed Bargama, “a man very black
in complexion, but most fair in mind and disposition.”</p>
          <p>Dr. Steetzen speaks of Abdallah, a native of Guber, in West
Africa, as by no means inferior to Europeans; he is described as
possessing a very intelligent countenance, although he had the
true Negro features and colour.</p>
          <p>The capacity of the Negro for the mathematical and
physical sciences, is fully proved by Hannibal, a colonel
in the Russian artillery, Lislet, of the Isle of France;
and Richard Banneker, the almanack maker of Maryland;
<pb id="adams97" n="97"/>
of these we have already furnished some particulars. There
was also in the last-named American state an African
named Fuller, who, although he could neither read nor
write, displayed extraordinary quickness in mental calculation.
Being asked in company, for the purpose of trying his powers,
how many seconds a person had lived who was seventy
years and some months old, he gave the answer in a minute
and a half. On reckoning it up in figures, a different
result was obtained: “have you not forgotten the leap years?”
asked the Negro: the omission was supplied, and it was found
that the answer was perfectly correct.</p>
          <p>Boerhaave and De Haen have given the strongest testimony that
our coloured fellow-men possess no mean insight into practical
medicine; and several have been known very dexterous surgeons. A
Negress at Yverdun, is mentioned by Blumenbach as being celebrated
for real knowledge and “a fine experienced hand.” James Derham,
too, our readers may remember, was one of the most distinguished
physicians in New Orleans. The son of the king of
Nimbana, came to England to study, acquired a proficiency the
sciences, and learnt Hebrew that he might read the bible in the
original. Stedman was acquainted with a Negro who knew the Koran by
heart. Higiemondo was an able artist: if the painter's business is to
impart life to nature, he was a master of this, according to the
testimony of Sandrart.</p>
          <p>In proof of the musical talent of the Negro, it may be
mentioned that slaves in America have been known to earn
enough by the exercise of this talent to purchase their freedom,
and to amass considerable property. The young
Freidig in Vienna, was an excellent performer on both the
violin and violoncello; he was also skilled in painting. Dr.
Madden speaks very highly of Zadiki, a learned slave in
Jamaica, who was redeemed through his intercession, dwelling
principally upon his good conduct, his great discernment and
sound discretion.</p>
          <p>Amongst learned Mulattoes, Castaing may be mentioned as
exhibiting poetic genius; his compositions adorn various editions
of collected poetry. Barbaud-Royer Boisroud, the author of 
<foreign lang="fre">Precis des Gemissements des Sang-mêlés</foreign>, 
announces himself as
belonging to this class; and Michael Mina, (called also
Miliscent,) was a Mulatto of St. Domingo. Julien Raymond,
likewise a Mulatto, associated himself with the class of moral
and political sciences, for the section of legislation  Without
being able to justify his conduct in every
<pb id="adams98" n="98"/>
respect, we may praise the energy with which he defended men
of colour and free Negroes: he published many works, the
greater part of which relate to the history of St. Domingo, and
may serve as an antidote to the calumnies circulated by the
colonists. We have already named the Cuban poet Placedo, and
Phillis Wheatley, let us add to these the name of Caesar, a
Negro of North Carolina, several of whose poems have been
published, and become popular, like those of Bloomfield.</p>
          <p>Durand and Demanet, who resided a long time in Guinea,
found Negroes with a keen and penetrating mind, a sound
judgment, taste, and delicacy. On different parts of the coast of
Africa, says Clarkson, there are Negroes who speak
two or three languages, and act as interpreters. Vaillant and other
travellers have remarked, that in general they possess very
retentive memories. Adamson, astonished to hear the Negroes
of Senegal mention a great number of stars, and converse
pertinently concerning them, expresses a belief that if they had
good instruments, they would become good astronomers.</p>
          <p>Henry Diaz, who is extolled in all the histories of Brazil, was a Negro:
once a slave, he became colonel of a regiment of soldiers of his
own colour. A Negro was also Mentor, born at Martinico, in
1771. Being made a prisoner of war by the English, he managed
to take possession of the vessel which was bearing him to this country
and carry her into Brest. To a noble physiognomy, he united an amenity
of character and a cultivated mind. He occupied a seat in the legislative
assembly by the side of the estimable Temeny. He was killed at
St. Domingo, having sullied his brilliant reputation by his latter conduct.
Cique, the chief of the Mendian Negroes, described under the head of the
Amisted captives, was a man of uncommon natural capacity.</p>
          <p>In addition to those already named, many Negroes have written
good poetry. Blumenbach possessed poems in English, Dutch,
and Latin, written by coloured persons. This learned and
philosophic man observes, that entire and large provinces of Europe might be named in which it would be difficult to meet, with such good writers, poets, philosophers,
and correspondents of the French Academy; and that, moreover,
there is no savage people who have distinguished themselves
by such examples of perfectability and capacity for scientific
cultivation; and consequently that none can approach more
nearly to the polished nations of the globe than the Negro.</p>
          <pb id="adams99" n="99"/>
          <p>A few more names added to our catalogue of remarkable and
illustrious Negroes, will serve to strengthen our position,
although not perhaps to convince those who are too blinded
by interest or prejudice to agree with us, even if what we advance
be indeed
<q direct="unspecified"><lg><l>“Confirmation strong as proof of holy writ.”</l></lg></q></p>
          <p>The examples which we shall now offer, will chiefly illustrate
the Negro's susceptibility to religious influences, and to the
more kindly and generous feelings of humanity—his natural
goodness, rather than his intellectual capacity, will here be
brought into view; this is the other, and, as we are inclined to
view it, the brighter half of his character—the more hopeful
aspect of his present condition, and promising sign
of his future advancement. From soil of such a moral
nature, what an abundant and enduring intellectual growth may
we look for; what a golden fruitage to be ripened and gathered
in the sunshine of freedom and christianity. We shall
continue to follow somewhat closely the valuable record
of facts collected and arranged by the Negro's friend
Wilson Armistead.</p>
          <p>Major Laing was astonished at the wisdom and goodness of
Be Seniera, king of Kooranko, who sent his minstrel to play
before the traveller, and welcome him with a song.
The same traveller gives an account of Assana Yeera, a Negro
king of strict probity, and universally beloved by his subjects.
Lucy Cardwell, a free Negress of Virginia, was a remarkable
instance of the power of religion operating on the mind. The
lucid intervals of her latter days were chiefly occupied with
prayer and praise.</p>
          <p>The possession of an enlarged and noble heart is evinced in
the history of Joseph Rachel, of Barbadoes, of whom
philanthropists take pleasure in speaking. Having become rich
he consecrated all his fortune to acts of benevolence; the
unfortunate, without distinction of colour, had a claim on his
affections; he gave to the indigent, lent to those who could
not make a return, visited prisoners, gave them good advice, and
endeavoured to bring back the guilty to virtue. John William , a
coloured man of New Jersey, naturally intelligent, was brought by
conviction  to the knowledge of the truth, and ended his days in 
prayer and thanksgiving to God. Zilpha Montjoy, an aged Negress
of New York, afforded a pattern of exemplary conduct. Her
pious and circumspect life rendered her an object of peculiar interest
<pb id="adams100" n="100"/>
to many. Alice, a female slave in Pennsylvania, attained to the
advanced age of one hundred and sixteen years, zealously
attending divine worship till she was ninety-five years old. The
honesty, love of truth, temperance, and industry of this Negress
have been highly commended.</p>
          <p>George Hardy, a coloured youth, discovered in his earliest years
a quickness of discernment and readiness of apprehension rarely
surpassed; he was able to read the bible when four years old.
Though furnished with scanty means of obtaining information, he
exhibited a vigour of intellect and originality of thought which a
protracted and enervating disease never subdued. Quashi, a Negro
slave, in the history of his tragical death, affords an illustration of
the exalted gratitude, friendship, and honour, which the despised
race are capable of entertaining. Moses, a Negro of Virginia, was a
remarkable pattern of piety; his prayers seemed to make all feel
that the Almighty was present. The interesting and deeply affecting
history of Zangara, stolen from Africa when very young, demonstrates
in the Negro the possession of the finer feelings of our nature. Respecting
the capabilities of two African youths, named Charles Knight and
Joseph May, educated at the Borough Road School, a high
testimony is given in the Minutes of Evidence before the
Committee of the House of Commons, on the West Coast of
Africa.</p>
          <p>Maquama, a Negro slave stolen from his native country, gives
a touching account of his sufferings when discarded
in a blind and helpless condition. His was evidently an
intelligent and reflective mind, and one imbued with the true
spirit of piety; witness this expression:—“The prospect of eternal
happiness which events have led to, infinitely overpays
all my sufferings.” Jacob Hodges, a Negro of Canandaigua,
furnishes one of the finest illustrations of the power
of divine truth, in the most ignorant and wretched of
mankind. Who has not been delighted in perusing the
narrative of the Negro servant related by Leigh Richmond, who
testifies of him:—“The more I conversed with this African
convert, the more satisfactory were the evidences of his mind
being spiritually enlightened, and his heart effectually wrought
upon by the grace of God. He bore the impression of the
Saviour's image in his heart, and exhibited the marks of
converting grace in his life and conversation, accompanied with
singular simplicity and unfeigned sincerity.”</p>
          <p>Belinda Lucas, was stolen from Africa when a child. She
purchased her freedom from slavery, and lived to about a
<pb id="adams101" n="101"/>
hundred years of age: her narrative affords a striking instance of
honest, persevering industry, and careful frugality. Angelo
Soliman was also carried away from his home early in life; he was
the son of an African prince, and died at Vienna in 1796. He was
distinguished by a high degree of mental culture, and extensive
learning, but more for his morality and excellence of character.
Jupiter Hammon, a Negro slave of Long Island, attained to
considerable advancement both in an intellectual and religious
point of view. He published an address to the Negroes of New
York, which contains much sound advice, embodied in such
excellent language, that were its genuineness not well attested,
considerable doubt might be entertained on this head.</p>
          <p>A very beautiful example of gratitude and affection towards a
former master, is afforded by one Gomez, spoken of by
Chambers; and also by Eustache, the noble black of St. Domingo,
of whom Miss Martineau gives a picture no less pleasing than it
appears to be historically true. But the most touching example of
this kind that we have ever heard or read, is embodied in an
address delivered by the Hon. Edward Everett, at the annual
meeting of the American Colonization Society, held at
Washington in January, 1853. This address contains so much that
is honourable alike to the heart and understanding of the speaker,
and to the coloured race whose cause we have undertaken to
plead, that we are tempted to make a long extract from it, feeling
assured that our space cannot be more usefully occupied, nor this
chapter more worthily concluded. After alluding to the doubts
entertained by some, as to whether there is in the native races of
Africa, “a basis of improvability;” and shewing by a reference to
both ancient and modern history, that such doubts cannot be
reasonably entertained, the eloquent speaker goes on to say:—</p>
          <p>“We are led into error by contemplating things too much in
the gross. There are tribes in Africa which have made no
contemptible progress in various branches of human
improvement. On the other hand, if we look closely at the condition
of the mass of the population in Europe, from Lisbon to
Archangel, from the Hebrides to the Black Sea—if we turn from
the few who possess wealth or competence, education, culture,
and that lordship over nature and all her forces which belongs to
instructed mind—if we turn from these to the benighted, destitute,
oppressed, superstitious, abject millions whose lives are passed in
the hopeless toils of the field, the factory, the mine—whose
<pb id="adams102" n="102"/>
inheritance is beggary, whose education is stolid ignorance—at
whose daily table hunger and thirst are the stewards—
whose rare festivity is brutal intemperance—if we could count
their number, gather into one aggregate their destitution
of the joys of life, and thus estimate the full extent
of the practical barbarism of the nominally civilized world,
we should be inclined, perhaps, to doubt the essential superiority 
of the present improved European race. If it be
essentially superior, why did it remain so long unimproved?
The Africans, you say, persevered in their original barbarism
for five thousand years. Well, the Anglo-Saxon race did the same
thing for nearly four thousand years; and in the great
chronology of Providence, a thousand years are but as one day.
A little more than ten centuries ago, and our Saxon ancestors
were not more civilized than some of the African tribes of the
present day. They were a savage, warlike people—pirates by sea,
bandits on shore, enslaved by the darkest superstitions, worshipping
divinities as dark and cruel as themselves; and Slave trade was carried
on in Great Britain eight hundred years ago as ruthlessly
as upon the coast of Africa at the present day. But it pleased
Divine Providence to pour the light of Christianity upon this
midnight darkness. By degrees, civilization, law, liberty, letters,
and arts came in and at the end of eight centuries we talk of the
essential inborn superiority of the Anglo-Saxon race, and look
down with disdain on those portions of the human family who have
lagged a little behind us in the march of civilization.</p>
          <p>At the present day Africa is not the abode of utter barbarism.
Here, again we do not discriminate—we judge in the gross.
Some of her tribes are, indeed, hopelessly broken
by internal wars and the foreign Slave trade; and the
situation of the whole continent is exceedingly adverse to
any progress in culture. But they are not savages— the
mass of the population live by agriculture; there is some
traffic between the coast and the interior, there is a rude
architecture, gold dust is collected, iron is smelted, weapons
and utensils of husbandry and household use are wrought,
cloth is manufactured and dyed, palm oil is expressed, and
schools are taught. Among the Mahomedan tribes the Koran is
read. I have seen a native African in this city who had passed forty
years of his life as a slave in the field , who, at the age of
seventy, wrote the Arabic character with the elegance of a
scribe. And Mungo Park tells us that lawsuits are argued with
as much ability, fluency, and
<pb id="adams103" n="103"/>
at as much length, in the interior of Africa, as at Edinburgh. I
certainly am aware that the condition of the most advanced
tribes of Central Africa is wretched, mainly in consequence of
the Slave trade, which exists among them in the most
deplorable form. The only wonder is, that, with this cancer
eating into their vitals from age to age, any degree of
civilization can exist.</p>
          <p>But I think it may be said, without exaggeration, that,
degraded as are the ninety millions of Africans, ninety millions
exist in Europe, to which each country contributes her quota,
not much less degraded. The difference is, and certainly an all-
important difference, that in Europe, intermingled with those
ninety millions, are fifteen to twenty millions possessed of all
degrees of culture, up to the very highest; while in Africa there is
not an individual who, according to our own standard, has
attained a high degree of intellectual cultivation; but if obvious
causes for this can be shown, it is unphilosophical to infer from
it essential incapacity. But all doubts of the incapacity of the
African race for self-government, and of their improvability
under favourable circumstances, seem to me to be removed by
what we witness at the present day, both in our own country
and on the coast of that continent. Notwithstanding the
disadvantages of their condition in this country, specimens of
intellectual ability, the talent of writing and speaking, capacity
for business, for the ingenious and mechanical arts, for
accounts, for the ordinary branches of academical learning, have
been exhibited by our coloured brethren which would do no
discredit to Anglo-Saxons. Paul Cuffee, well recollected in New
England, was a person of great energy. His father was an
African slave—his mother an Indian of the Elizabeth Islands,
Mass. I have already alluded to the extraordinary attainments
of Abderrahaman—a man of better manners or more respectable
appearance I never saw. The learned blacksmith of Alabama, now
in Liberia, has attained a celebrity <sic corr="scarcely">scarely</sic> inferior to that of his
white brother known by the same designation. I frequently attended
the examinations at a school in Cambridge, at which Beverly
Williams was a pupil. Two youths from Georgia and a son of my
own were his fellow pupils. Beverly was a born slave in Mississippi, and
apparently of pure African blood. He was one of the best
scholars—perhaps the best Latin scholar—in his class. These are
indications of intellectual ability afforded under discouraging
circumstances at home.</p>
          <pb id="adams104" n="104"/>
          <p>On the coast of Africa, the success of Liberia (the creation of
this society,) ought to put to rest all doubts on this question.
The affairs of this interesting settlement, under
great difficulties and discouragements, have been managed
with a discretion, and energy, and I must say, all things considered,
with a success, which authorize the most favourable inferences as to the
capacity of the coloured races for self-government. It is about
thirty years since the settlement began, and I think it must be
allowed that its progress compare very favourably with that of
Virginia or Plymouth, after an equal length of time. They have
established a well-organized constitution of republican government.
It is administered with ability; the courts of justice are modelled after
our own; they have schools and churches. The soil is tilled, the country is
explored, the natives are civilized, the Slave trade is banished, a
friendly intercourse is maintained with foreign powers, and
England and France have acknowledged their independent sovereignty.
Would a handful of Anglo-Americans from the humblest classes of
society here, do better than this ? The truth is, Mr. President,
and with this I conclude, an influence has been, and I trust ever
will be, at work through the agency of the colony of Liberia,
and other similar agencies, I trust hereafter to be added,
abundantly competent to effect this great undertaking, and that
is the sovereign power of Christian love. Ah! sir, this after all
is sometimes resisted and subdued—commercial enterprise
becomes bankrupt, state policy is outwitted, but in the long
run, pure, manly, rather let me say heavenly, love
can never fail. It is the moral sentiment, principally under
the guidance and impulse of religious zeal, that has civilized the
world. Arms, and craft, and mammon seize their opportunity and
mingle in the work, but cannot kill its vitality.</p>
          <p>That our coloured brethren, equally with ourselves, are
susceptible of the moral sentiments, it would be an affront to
your discernments to argue. I read last year in a newspaper, an
anecdote which seemed to put this point in so beautiful
and affecting a light that, with your permission, I will repeat it.
A citizen of Rapides, in Louisiana, with his servant started for
California, hoping to improve his not prosperous
circumstances by sharing the golden harvest of that region. For
a while they were successful, but the health of the master at
length failed. What, in that distant region, under a constitution
forbidding Slavery, and in that new and scarcely organized
society—what was the conduct of the
<pb id="adams105" n="105"/>
the slave? Priest and Levite, as the master lay ill of typhus
fever, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other
side. But the faithful servant tended, watched, protected his
stricken master, by day and by night—his companion, nurse, and
friend. At length the master died. What, then, was the conduct
of the slave, as he stood on those lonely wastes, by the remains
of him who, when living, he had served? He dug his decent
grave in the golden sands, gathered up the fruits of their joint
labours, (these he considered the sacred property of his
master's family,) toiled a few more weeks under the burning
sun of a Californian summer to accumulate the means of paying
his passage to the States, and then returned to the family
of his master, in Louisiana. I cannot vouch for the truth of the
story. I have heard of tales which, if not true, were well
invented. This, sir, is too good to be invented. I believe, I
know, it must be true; and such a fact proves far more the
possession by the African race of the moral sentiments by
which the land of their fathers is to be civilized, than volumes
of argument. Sir, that master and that slave ought to be in marble
and brass. If a person so humble as myself, so soon to pass
away and be forgotten, dare promise it, I would say their
memory shall never perish. <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">O! fortunati ambro; siquid mea
carmina possint nulla dies unquam memoris vos eximet ava.</foreign></hi>
There is a moral wealth in that incident beyond the treasures of
California. If all the gold she has already yielded to the
indomitable industry of the adventurer, and all that she yet
locks from the cupidity of man in the virgin chambers of her
snow-clad sierras, were all molten into one ingot, it would not buy
the moral worth of that scene. Sir, I leave you to make the
application. I have told you—you knew it well before—how
Africa is to be civilized, and who are to do the work. And what
remains but to bid God speed to the undertaking?”</p>

          <p>MOST, if not all, of those whom we have noticed in the
foregoing pages, have passed away from the stage of life;
we can but refer to their histories—to their deeds and
recorded words—in support of our argument: but others
there are, and not a few, to whom we may point as LIVING
WITNESSES, and examples of the truth of our argument.
Remarkable and highly-gifted men in every way are many
of these dark-skinned brothers of ours, who are now labouring
for oppressed humanity, and doing good service to the cause
of truth and freedom: faithful and eloquent ones, strong in
their advocacy of whatsoever is just, and holy, and pure,
and of good repute; men of sound piety, of deep learning,
and of great intellectual wealth, are among them, to give
the lie to the charge of inferiority: men of wonderful acquirements,
considering the difficulties under which they have
laboured in their early days of ceaseless toil and cruel
bondage: men of warm hearts and generous natures, with a
firm faith in the goodness of God, and a tender love for
their fellow-men, notwithstanding their hardships and their
sufferings, and all the blunting, and deadening, and depraving
influences to which they have been subjected: men who,
though they have been hunted from their own shores, where
they were liable to be chained, and scourged, and maimed,
and shot like very beasts, and come to us in nakedness and
destitution, we are proud to own as brothers, to take by
the hand and introduce into the bosoms of our families, our
halls of science and learning, our places of worship, and
wherever our purest, noblest, and holiest thoughts, feelings,
and aspirations abide. A brief—a very brief—sketch of the
lives of a few of these LIVING WITNESSES, is all we have
space to give and this we the less regret, because they are
most of them easily accessible in one or other of the cheap
<pb id="adams107" n="107"/>
books which have been published to meet the increasing
demand for anti-slavery literature, which has of late assumed
so important a position in the world of letters.</p>
          <div3>
            <head>FREDERICK DOUGLASS.</head>
            <p>THE narrative of Frederick Douglass, published in this
country in the year 1845, is one calculated to excite our
strongest feelings of pity, and sympathy, and admiration for
the man, and of horror and detestation of the system which
would make him something less than a man. The following
are a few of the leading incidents in the life of this highly gifted
champion of his suffering and oppressed race:—He
was born a slave on a plantation of Maryland, <hi rend="italics">about</hi> the year
1817; few slaves know exactly their own age; Douglass says
that he never met with one who could tell the date of his
birthday. If an owner were to be asked how old such and such
a slave might be, he would reply, “Oh, about so and so last
fall,” just as he would speak of a horse or a dog; and this fact
alone speaks loudly for the debasing influence of the system,
both upon slave and master. The father of Douglass was a white
man, and, as it seems more than probable, his mother's owner.
This double relation is not unfrequently sustained by the same
person in the southern states, so that a parent often sells his
own children, which, Douglass says, he is frequently compelled
to do out of deference for the feelings of his white wife; “and
cruel as the deed may appear, it is often the dictate of humanity for
him to do so , for unless he does this, he must not only whip
him himself, but must stand by and see one white son tie
up his brother of but a few shades darker complexion than
himself, and ply the gory lash on his naked back.”</p>
            <p>Douglass was separated from his mother when quite an
infant: of her he has only a faint recollection of some few
stealthy visits paid by night: the frightened, tearful woman
bending over her child, whom she must not nurse and fondle,
bidden to repress the maternal instincts and yearnings of her
womanly nature, driven to labour, tasked beyond her strength,
and worn out ere half her natural course was run, she died
when her boy was but seven years of age, and the young
Mulatto was soon after sent to live with a relative of his master
at Baltimore, and here it was that he first began to acquire the
rudiments of knowledge: his new mistress, to whose little boy
<pb id="adams108" n="108"/>
he was intended as a sort of humble companion and protector,
taught him the alphabet, and to know the beauty of a
white face when lit up with the smile of kindness. She was
proceeding with her good work of instruction, when her husband
found out what was going on, and interposed his authority,
pointing out that it was not only unlawful, but also unsafe, to
teach a slave to read; “a nigger,” said he, “should know nothing
but to obey his master: if you teach him to read, he will become
discontented and unhappy, and for ever unfit to be a slave.”
These words, spoken in the hearing of the lad, awoke a train of
thought in his breast which did not again slumber. The secret of 
the white man's power was revealed to him—knowledge, he found,
was the key to freedom—and he resolved to win it, and steadily
he kept this resolution in view, omitting no opportunity of adding to
his little store. Truly interesting is it to follow him through the seven
years of his Baltimore life; to notice the shifts and expedients, in no
ways disgraceful or dishonourable, by which, with great toil and
perseverance, he enriched his mind with that wealth which, slave as
he was, eventually placed him far above many of the rich and the
free. One or two instances of his ardour and ingenuity in “the pursuit of
knowledge under difficulties” we cannot help alluding to. He was
accustomed to make friends of all the little white boys whom he met
with in the streets, and to convert them into teachers, carrying in his
pocket pieces of bread saved from his allowance, with which he
rewarded them for their trouble. He constantly carried a book in his
pocket, and seldom went on an errand without at the same
time learning a lesson therefrom. His master, and his mistress
too when told of her error, threw every impediment possible
in the way of his acquisition of learning, but all in vain; the
lamp was kindled and would burn on.</p>
            <p>This is how he learned to write;—Being some time employed
in a ship-yard, he noticed that the timbers—prepared, it may be,
for one of those “Baltimore clippers” of “middle passage”
celebrity—had certain letters marked on them, to denote the
position which they were to occupy; by inquiry of the white men,
he found out what these letters were called, what they stood for,
and then learned to imitate them in chalk, rather awkwardly at first
you may he sure. Carrying his piece of chalk in his pocket, if he
fell in with a boy whom he knew was a more expert calligraphist
than himself, he would say, after giving a specimen of his best style,
on the wall or pavement as it might be, “There, beat that if
<pb id="adams109" n="109"/>
you can!” Of course the urchin thus challenged did his best to beat it,
and so little black Freddy, all the while attentively observing him,
got a writing lesson gratis. We will let him tell in his own words
how he perfected himself in this important art:—“By this time
my little Master Thomas had gone to school, and learned how to
write, and had written over a number of copy-books. These had been
brought home and shown to some of our near neighbours, and then thrown
aside. My mistress used to go to class-meeting every Monday
afternoon, and leave me to take care of the house. When
left thus, I used to spend the time in writing in the spaces
left in Master Thomas's copy-book, crossing what he had
written. I continued to do this until I could write a hand
very similar to Master Thomas. Thus, after a long and tedious
effort, I finally succeeded in learning to write.”</p>
            <p>The death of Douglass' owner causing a division of the
property, he fell to the share of Miss Lucretia, the daughter,
and herein was fortunate; for the son, Master Andrew, was
a brutal wretch. “I once saw him,” says the narrator, “take
my little brother by the throat, throw him on the ground,
and with the heel of his boot stamp upon his head, until the
blood gushed forth from his nose and ears.” Before he left
Baltimore to return once more to the place of his birth, a
compilation called the <hi rend="italics">Columbian Orator</hi> had fallen into
the hands of our young slave. In it were Sheridan's speeches
on Catholic Emancipation: there he read bold denunciations
of slavery of every kind, and a noble vindication of human
rights, which stirred his spirit like a trumpet call. Henceforth,
we are told, he had but one aim in life—freedom for
himself and his race! This he determined, if possible, to
achieve, and the determination was no doubt strengthened
by what took place at the valuation of his late master's
property. “We were all ranked together. Men and women,
old and young, married and single, were ranked with horses,
sheep, and swine. There were horses and men, cattle and
and children, all holding the same rank in the
scale of being, and all subjected to the same narrow examination.
Silvery-headed age and sprightly youth, maids and
matrons, had to undergo the same indelicate inspection. At
this moment I saw more clearly than ever the brutalizing
effects of slavery, upon both slave and slaveholder.”</p>
            <p>Neither Miss Lucretia nor Master Andrew lived long to enjoy
their share of the property, which was dispersed here and there
into strange hands. Frederick's poor old grandmother, who
had been a faithful servant in her master's
<pb id="adams110" n="110"/> 
family throughout the whole of her lengthened existence—“who
had rocked him in infancy, attended him in childhood, served
him through life, and in death wiped from his icy brow the cold
death sweat and closed his eyes for ever, was nevertheless left
a slave in the hands of strangers; and in their hands she saw
her children, her grandchildren, and her great-grandchildren
divided—divided like so many sheep, without being gratified
with the small privilege of a single word as to them or their
own destiny.” We would fain quote the whole of the feeling
and eloquent description of this poor old servant, turned out to
die lonely and unaided, as a reward for her faithful devotion to
this ungrateful family, but our limited space will not allow of
this; we have already dwelt at too great a length upon the early
period of Douglass' history, and must now hasten on to
complete our outline sketch.</p>
            <p>In 1832 that human chattel called Frederick Douglass fell into
the hands of Mr. Thomas Auld, of St. Michaels, “a pious
and converted man, but withal excessively mean and
cruel, giving his slaves food in scanty proportions, but, to make
up for it, blows in abundance—a great religious professor, and
a great stumbling-block in the way of true religion.” The
remarks of Douglass upon this man, and upon
the class which he represents, are extremely forcible, but we must
pass on to state that Mr. Auld, finding that his servant had an
inconvenient appetite, and some other serious faults,
determined on letting him out to a “Nigger broker” for twelve
months. Covey was the name of this person, whose mission
it was to “break in” obstreperous Negroes; and in the process, as
may well be imagined, some unamiable traits of human character
were fully developed. Covey believed in the whip, indeed it appears that
he believed in nothing else, and he used it most unsparingly. We
have in our first chapter called the attention of our readers to
Gilbert's picture<ref id="ref14" n="14" rend="sc" target="note14" targOrder="U">* </ref>of poor Douglass crouching under the lash of this tyrant;
let them look at it once more, and realize the state of utter degradation
into which even a high-souled, noble man may be forced by the
workings of this horrible system. After describing his frequent
floggings, so that he was hardly ever free from a sore back,
Douglass goes on to say, “If at any one time of my life more
than another I was made to drink the bitterest dregs of slavery,
that time was during ,the first six months of my stay with Mr. Covey.
We were worked in all weathers. It was never too hot or too cold;
<note id="note14" n="14" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref14">*  “Uncle Tom's Cabin Almanack.”</note>
<pb id="adams111" n="111"/>
it could never rain, blow, or snow too hard for us to work
in the field. Work, work, work was scarcely more the order
of the day than the night. The longest days were too short
for him. I was somewhat unmanageable when I first went
there, but a few months of this discipline soon tamed me. I was
broken in body, soul, and spirit; my natural elasticity was
crushed; my intellect languished; the disposition to read
departed, the cheerful spark that lingered about my eye died;
the dark night of slavery closed in upon me.”</p>
            <p>But crushed and depressed as he was, his noble spirit was
not wholly subdued—his aspirations not altogether quenched;
at times there broke through the clouds and thick darkness that
surrounded him, gleams of hope—flashes of light from that
heaven of freedom for which his soul panted. As he looked
upon the noble ships spreading their white sails in the bay of
Chesapeake, near which his master's house stood, his soul cast
off its trammels; his resolution to be one day free returned,
and he looked for the better time that he felt sure was coming
for his recompense for all past woes and sufferings. And that better
day did at length arrive, when Douglass stood upright and
unabashed as a true man should, before God and his fellow-men
upon the shores of Great Britain. Here he was kindly received,
and heartily welcomed, and after going through the length and
breadth of the land, and addressing public meetings out of number
on behalf of his countrymen in chains, with a power of eloquence
which captivated his auditors, and brought the cause which he
pleaded home to their hearts, he returned to America, and by means
of the subscriptions raised in this country, his freedom was purchased
of his legal master; and an Anti-Slavery paper called the <hi rend="italics">North
Star</hi>, was established, this he continues to conduct with great ability
and success; and by lecturing and other means, promotes the work
which he has so much at heart.</p>
            <p>We have taken a long leap out of the deep slough of
despondence and degradation into which Douglass was at one
time plunged, to the high ground of his eventual freedom.
Many interesting and affecting incidents of his career lie
between, for which we refer our readers to his published
narrative. The following extract from an address delivered by
William Lloyd Garrison, at Boston, in 1845, is powerfully
descriptive of the manner of his first appearance on a public
platform:—“In the month of August, 1841,” says he, “I attended
an anti-slavery convention in Nantuket, at which it was my
happiness to become acquainted with Frederick Douglass.
<pb id="adams112" n="112"/>
He was a stranger to nearly every member of this body,
<hi rend="italics">but having recently made his escape from the southern house
of bondage</hi>, and feeling his curiosity excited to ascertain the
principles and measures of the abolitionists —of whom he had
heard a somewhat vague description while he was a slave—he
was induced to give his attendance on the occasion alluded to, though
at that time a resident in New Bedford.</p>
            <p>Fortunate, most fortunate occurrence! fortunate for the
millions of his manacled brethren yet panting for deliverance
from their awful thraldom! fortunate for the cause of Negro
emancipation and of universal liberty! fortunate for the land of
his birth, which he has done much to save and bless! fortunate
for the large circle of friends and acquaintances whose
sympathy and affection he has strongly secured by the many
sufferings he has endured, by his virtuous traits of character, by
ever abiding remembrances of those who are in bonds, as being
bound with him! fortunate for the multitudes in various parts
of our republic, whose minds he has enlightened on the subject
of Negro slavery, and who have been melted to tears by his
pathos or roused to virtuous indignation by his stirring
eloquence against the enslavers of men! fortunate for himself, as
it at once brought him into the field of public usefulness, ‘gave
the assurance of a MAN,’ quickened the slumbering energies of
his soul, and consecrated him to the great work of breaking the
rod of the oppressor, and letting the oppressed go free.</p>
            <p>I shall never forget his first speech at the convention;
the extraordinary emotion it excited in my own mind, the
powerful impression it created upon a crowded auditory,
completely taken by surprise; the applause which followed
from the beginning to the end of his felicitous remarks. I
think I never hated slavery so intensely as at that moment;
my perception of the enormous outrage which is inflicted by
it on the godlike nature of its victims, was rendered far more
clear than ever. There stood one, in physical proportion and stature—
commanding and erect, in natural eloquence a prodigy, in soul
manifestly ‘created but a little lower than the angels,’ yet a slave,
aye, a fugitive slave, trembling for his safety, hardly daring to
believe that on the American soil, a single white person could
be found who would befriend him at all hazards, for the love of
God and humanity. Capable of high attainments as an
intellectual and moral being, needing nothing but a comparatively
small amount of cultivation to make him an ornament to society
and a blessing to his race. By the law of the land, by the
<pb id="adams113" n="113"/>
voice of the people, by the terms of the slave code, he was only
a piece of property, a beast of burden, a chattel personal,
nevertheless!”</p>
          </div3>
          <div3>
            <head>JAMES W. C. PENNINGTON, D. D.</head>
            <p>was born in the slave-breeding state of Maryland, on the estate
of Col. Gordon, who was considered, on the whole, to be a kind
and considerate master, and a good man; his goodness, however,
we imagine, was only comparative, and not positive; at all
events, some of his recorded acts and deeds seem to us those of
an extremely bad man. This, perhaps, is owing to our anti-slavery
prejudices, and foolish notions about Negro equality.
Pennington's father and mother were the chattels of different
owners, either of whom could sever when he pleased, the holy
bond of matrimony, and so put asunder that which God had
joined.</p>
            <p>The narrative of James Pennington, “the Fugitive Blacksmith,”
as he is sometimes called, was published here in 1849,
and from it we gather the particulars given in this sketch,
it is a plain unvarnished tale, and bears the impress of
truth. Our hero gives no date to his birth, probably because,
like Douglass, he knew it not; the first event in his slave life
which is recorded, was being given with his mother and an
elder brother, to a son of his master, who had married, and
was about to settle two hundred miles away, in Washington
county. Here was an early breaking up of family ties; the
father was left behind, in Maryland, and might at any time
be commanded to take another wife, of his master's choosing;
as the mother might be forced to connect herself with another
husband. This trial, however, was spared them; the father
was after a while purchased by the owner of the rest of the
family, and so they were reunited. In Pennington's childhood
there was little on which he could look back in after years with
any degree of pleasure; as soon as his tender limbs could bear
the yoke, it was placed upon him, and woe be to him
when his strength failed to bear the allotted burthen; curses and
stripes from the overseer, and petty persecutions, amounting often
to acts of cruelty, from his master's children, were the chief incidents
of this period of his existence. Well might the prospect of coming
years be to him dark and dismal. With uninstructed mind, and
passions checked but not subdued, he grew to maturity a
<pb id="adams114" n="114"/>
“first-rate blacksmith,” warranted to do a certain amount of
skilled labour, and to be satisfied with just so much sustenance as
would suffice to keep him from sinking under it.</p>
            <p>His market value was so many hundred dollars, according to
the demand there might be for such an article; kind
treatment, comfortable clothing, and such like, were merely
extras to be thrown in as the interest or caprice of the owner
might dictate: as for the mind, that was not wanted, so the less
said about that the better—let it sleep: machines with minds are apt
to have a will of their own, which might run counter to their
owner's will—by no means enlighten <hi rend="italics">that!</hi> State laws say you must
not do it; so keep the mind in ignorance by all means: do not let
the machine suspect that it has one. What! a soul to be saved? Ah,
Well, time enough to think about that when the physical
powers decay—when the article is worn out and thrown by
like old lumber; then awake the dying spark, and if you can, fan it
into a flame; teach it to aspire, to immortality and heaven. Such
glorious themes will no doubt be strange to the poor benighted
soul, pressed down beneath a load of good feelings crushed and
withered, and of evil passions stimulated to rank luxuriance of
growth; but it may be awoke—it may be saved; if not, why it must
go; the body is “the property” that we value, the soul is quite a
secondary affair; our temporal interests are of more consequence
to us than the eternal interests of all the Negroes that were ever
created. So say the slave-holders, in effect, if not in words.</p>
            <p>But we are forgetting Pennington, who, when about
twenty-one years old, was sold, for the sum of seven hundred
dollars, but soon afterwards repurchased, and taken back to work
upon the estate, where his knowledge of handicrafts made him very
useful. With Pennington it seems that the man was never wholly lost in the
slave; he had a certain degree, perhaps we should say a proper
degree, of pride in the skill of his hands, and the due performance
of the work entrusted to him; there was something of manly
independence left about him in spite of the scourgings, and taunts,
and revilings, and cruel usage which he had received when a boy.
Since he had reached mature years, he had, from the nature of his
occupation, been less subjected to this sort of usage than the
common field hands, who are constantly in fear of the overseer's
whip. He tells us that he delighted in giving a neatness and finish to
his workings in iron, and in making little articles of use and ornament
out of the common way: his intellect was evidently awakening.
<pb id="adams115" n="115"/>
Perhaps his Master, who we are told was, as respects discipline, “a
thorough slave-holder, a perpetualist who would do anything to
secure unqualified obedience, saw this, and thought it
dangerous to the stability of the “peculiar institution.” At all events
he took effectual means to check the growing spirit of independence,
and to let not only the young blacksmith, but his whole family, feel that
they were slaves, subject to his absolute will. He flogged the father,
who seems to have been a useful , industrious, and inoffensive
old man, and he flogged the son for no real offence that we can
learn; and then by a series of annoyances, and a tyrannical
exercise of his power, strove to break their spirits. But in this he
failed, as far as the hero of our sketch was concerned; by him an
attempt to escape was determined on, and successfully carried out,
though not without many struggles and heartaches at leaving his
parents. His brother had some years previously passed into the hands
of another master—a stonemason in a town, to whom he had been put
to learn the trade, and with whom he was pretty comfortable.</p>
            <p>We cannot follow Pennington through the toils and terrors of
his flight; he had many narrow escapes of a recapture,
but finally reached Pennsylvania, where he was secreted and cared
for by some members of the Society of Friends, who in America,
as elsewhere, are ever foremost in works of mercy and
benevolence. With them he remained upwards
of a year; learned to read, acquired a knowledge of the truths of
salvation, became impressed with deep religious convictions,
and then went to New York, where he joined a church, and
entered upon a course of study with a view to qualify himself for
the ministry, on which his hopes and desires were fixed. What an
ambition this for the poor uninstructed Negro—the slave fleeing
for life and liberty would fain instruct others in those truths which
make all men free. The means by which he acquired the knowledge
necessary for his high vocation, are set forth in his narrative in the
simple and earnest language of truth; and if we can there read aright
the heart of the man, we may say that he is animated with the true
apostolic air it of Christian love and charity. His testimony against
slavery is full of points which merit the serious attention of all who
defend, on any ground, that accursed system; and how forcibly and
touchingly is it uttered:—“It is a sin and a wrong which I can never
forgive. It robbed me of my education; the injury is irreparable—I
feel the embarrassment more seriously now
<pb id="adams116" n="116"/>
than ever I did before. It cost me two years' hard labour after I
had fled, to unshackle my mind; it was three years before I
purged language of slavery's idioms; it was four years before I
had thrown off the crouching aspect of slavery; and now the evil
that besets me is a great lack of that general information, the
foundation of which is most effectually laid in that part of life
which I served as a slave. When I consider how much more—
more than ever—depends upon sound and thorough education
among coloured men, I am grievously overwhelmed with a sense
of my deficiency, and more especially as I can never hope to
make it up. If I know my own heart, I have no ambition but to
serve the cause of suffering humanity; all that I have deserved
or sought has been to make me more efficient for good. So far I
have some consciousness that I have done my utmost;—and
should my future days be few or many, I am reconciled to meet
the last account, hoping to be acquitted of any wilful neglect of
duty: but I shall have to go to my last account with this charge
against the system of slavery,—‘Vile monster, thou has hindered
me of my usefulness by robbing me of my early education!’ ”</p>
            <p>In our opening chapter, we have made some allusion to
Pennington's eloquence, and to his justly earned academical
honours. He has been now for several years the settled minister
of the first coloured Presbyterian church in New York. He is
besides a member of the Presbytery, and of various other
religious and educational bodies.</p>

            <head>JOSIAH HENSON.</head>
            <p>TRULY a man tried and found faithful was Josiah Henson,
“raised,” like the subjects of our two previous sketches; in
Maryland, it was his lot to suffer in early life some of the most
aggravated evils of the slavery system. While yet a mere child, he
was horrified by the sight of the mangled and bleeding body of
his father, who was cruelly scourged for resenting a brutal
assault committed on his mother by the overseer of the estate
on which the family lived. The sale of the elder Henson
followed soon after his punishment, which appears to have so
embittered his mind, that he became sullen and morose, and
comparatively useless. Then came the death of Dr.
Mc'Pherson, who owned Josiah and his mother, and, being
a kind-hearted man, treated his slaves
<pb id="adams117" n="117"/>
well. The human stock on the estate being sold, the mother
and child passed into the hands of one Riley, who is described
as a coarse, vulgar, and licentious man. Notwithstanding the
suffering and privation which Josiah passed in the hands of
such an owner, he yet seems to have been diligent and
faithful, and even ambitious to excel. In his published narrative
of his life he says, in relation to this period, “My objects were to
be first in the field, whether we were hoeing, mowing, or
reaping; to surpass those of my own age, or indeed any age, in
athletic exercises; and to obtain, if possible, the favourable
regard of the petty despot who owned us.”</p>
            <p>Henson's zeal and assiduity, however, in the service of his
master, gave him no higher claims to consideration than those which
arose from his increased marketable value, and the slave worked
on, to Riley's profit and advantage, without experiencing much
of the sunshine of that favour which should have rewarded his
efforts. Thus repelled from the object towards which they
were at first directed, his feelings and sympathies expanded
around those more immediately on his own level—his
fellow-slaves and sufferers; and he began to awake to a 
perception of his and their debased condition. Being
a strong, steady, useful hand, in whom confidence might
be reposed, he came by degrees to be a sort of leading man on
the estate, and he contrived to use his limited power so
as, without exciting the jealousy or suspicion or those above
him, to mitigate some of the evils under which the slaves
groaned; thus he won their love and confidence, and by his
persuasions could induce them to labour more earnestly and
heartily than they would for all the curses and stripes of the
overseer. This functionary happening to die, Henson was 
appointed to succeed him from motives of policy and the 
advantage of the change was soon apparent in the increase of
the crops and the general improvement of the whole aspect of
things on the estate. The owner's extravagant intemperate habits,
however, were fast bringing him to ruin; in vain did the poor
slaves sweat and toil, and the overseer stimulate them to
increased exertion; the money was spent in the gambling-house
and the tavern, and other places of profligate resort; and thither
had Henson frequently to repair to bring home his brutal master,
rendered incapable by drink of leaving unassisted the scene of
debauchery. On one of these occasions, finding Riley engaged
in a fight, when it is always considered the slave's duty to rush
in and save the master at any risk of life or limb, Henson,
in performing this duty, had the misfortune to overturn a drunken
white man who was staggering
<pb id="adams118" n="118"/>
about, and required but little to complete his prostration.
This was an offence not to be overlooked, and dearly did
the faithful Negro pay for it; he was waylaid by the offended
person, assisted by three slaves over whom he had control,
and so severely beaten, that he was left weltering in his blood,
with both his shoulder blades and one arm broken.
The miscreant who inflicted these injuries, which rendered
Henson a cripple for life, was not punished: no white man
witnessed the transaction, and he had only to swear that he
acted in self-defence.</p>
            <p>For five months did Henson lie upon the earthen floor
of his hut, too weak and agonized to leave it; his fractured
limbs were merely bound up by a female ignorant of surgery,
and permanent distortion was the consequence: he was still,
however, retained on the estate, as his skilful management
of the hands and crops could not well be dispensed with.
He had some time previously been persuaded by his mother
to attend the preaching of a pious layman, who was accustomed
to address the Negroes on the great concerns of a
life hereafter; the text was from Hebrews, ii. 9—“That He
by the grace of God should taste of death for every man,”
and the speaker dwelt especially upon the fact of the Saviour
having died for <hi rend="italics">every man,</hi> whether slave or master. This
made a great impression upon Henson's mind, and gave him
new ideas of the importance of a human soul. The text
taught him to set a higher value upon himself and his fellow-
slaves; it set him thinking upon subjects high and solemn,
and had a wonderful effect in lifting him out of the darkness
and degradation of his state of slavery. He became at once
a man and a Christian; and well would it be if every one to
whom the light of divine truth has been vouchsafed had
followed its guidance as faithfully and earnestly as this poor
despised and <sic corr="ill-used">ill used</sic> Negro. At the age of twenty-four
Henson married a Negro girl who, like himself, was impressed
with religious convictions, and who loved him none the less for
his elevated shoulders and distorted arms: the union seems
to have been a happy one; and we may as well state here
that, with this beloved wife and the two children which she
bore to him, Henson afterwards effected his escape to Canada.
But before this happy period arrived, he had great trials of
his integrity to encounter, and wrongs and sufferings to
undergo. To a few of these we must allude as briefly as
possible.</p>
            <p>Finding himself on the verge of ruin, Henson's master, in order
thus to save the most valuable part of his property,
<pb id="adams119" n="119"/>
requested his overseer to conduct his slaves, eighteen in number,
to Kentucky, where his brother resided. The commission was
a difficult one to execute, but Henson performed it faithfully,
passing through a thousand miles of unknown country in the
depth of winter without losing a single slave. When in the state
of Ohio, it was suggested to him that he had now an opportunity
of becoming free, and of liberating his companions in captivity.
But no! he had pledged himself to the performance of a certain
duty, and no consideration of personal advantage could turn
him aside. What was his reward? Listen! After taking care of
Riley's Negroes for three years, and conducting their operations
on the Kentucky farm with his accustomed skill and success,
he, when orders were received to sell them, obtained leave to
visit his master in Maryland, and on the way, having
previously much improved himself by practice in religious
exercises, he managed, by preaching in several
pulpits, and stating the object in view, to raise money for
the purchase of his release. The price demanded by Riley was
four hundred and fifty dollars, and three hundred and fifty
were at once paid down. His master had previously
endeavoured to dispossess the poor Negro of the pass which 
authorized his return to Kentucky, and being defeated in this
attempt, resorted to another stratagem to prevent his manumission.
He made out the certificate of freedom, but affecting great solicitude
for its safety, sealed it up and directed it to his brother Amos, telling
Henson that, as to break a seal was felony, nobody would dare deprive
him of precious document. This placed Henson entirely in the
hands of Riley's brother, by whom alone the packet might be
legally opened. What was Henson's astonishment to be told on
reaching home that he had yet six hundred and fifty dollars to
pay, Riley having advised his brother that the price fixed
on was a thousand dollars! Thus was the poor Negro
tricked and disappointed. After all his exertions, all his
reasonable hopes and expectations, he had lost his all and was
still a slave! “But,” said he (and mark the Christian spirit of 
the declaration,) “I consoled myself as well as I could, and set
about my work again, with as quiet a mind as I could command,
resolved to trust in God and never despair.”</p>
            <p>Soon after this Amos Riley, who wanted money, and, like
his brother, was restrained by no scruples of conscience,
determined on an act of the blackest ingratitude and direst
cruelty; this was to send Henson to the New Orleans market
for sale. He was accordingly bidden to prepare for a voyage
<pb id="adams120" n="120"/>
for his master's son, who was to act as salesman, and the poor
Negro's heart sank within him when he thought of the
separation from his wife and children, and of the dreadful fate
which generally awaits the slave who is sold south. On
his way to the southern market, thoughts of revenge and plans of
escape frequently came into the Negro's mind: on one
occasion he resolved upon an act of wholesale murder, and the
opportunity was afforded him of carrying his plan in effect;
but his affrighted conscience shrunk back from the deed of
blood which his phrenzy had suggested, and his arm was
mercifully stayed. And now came a crisis in which his 
character shone out like gold tried in the furnace. Even while he
was in treaty for the sale of the injured Negro, Riley was
smitten with fever, and brought near to death's door, and was
only saved by the unremitting care and attention of his slave,
who, instead of escaping, as he might have done, watched
over the young man like a brother, and conveyed him, as soon
as he was able to bear the voyage, safely back to his home.</p>
            <p>This is a beautiful incident, and it ought to convince the
most prejudiced reader that there are elements of good in
the Negro character, which only require to be quickened and
stimulated by religion, to produce an abundant growth of
virtues and Christian graces. Henson's life all through is a
proof of this. Since his escape to Canada he has devoted
himself entirely to the service of his fellow-sufferers in the
house of bondage, out of which he has been the principal
means of delivering, it is said, no less than one hundred and
eighteen persons. He has undergone incredible hardships,
and several times risked his life and liberty to effect this.
He is earnest and untiring in his efforts to spread the 
knowledge of the gospel among his brethren and, notwithstanding
his defective education, is both a successful and eloquent
teacher and preacher. He was one of the chief movers in
the establishment of the Dawn Institute in Canada, a portion
of land on which are erected schools and other educational
buildings, where coloured people are encouraged to settle
and instructed in the useful and industrial arts. It was in
aid of the funds of this establishment that Henson and
his son came to England a short time since; he addressed
several large audiences, preached in the pulpits and sat at
the, tables of some of our most distinguished ministers and
philanthropists. And this is the man who once stood, a poor
little trembling piece of sable humanity, on the sale platform
of the slave mart, ready to be knocked down to the highest
bidder!</p>
            <pb id="adams121" n="121"/>
            <p>Here is one of the earliest experiences of his life, taken from
his published narrative:—“My brothers and sisters were bid off
one by one, while my mother, holding my hand, looked on in an
agony of grief, the cause of which I but little understood at first,
but which dawned on my mind, with dreadful clearness, as the
sale proceeded. My mother was then separated from me, and
put up in her turn. She was bought by a man named Isaac Riley,
residing in Montgomery county, and then I was offered to the
assembled purchasers. My mother, half distracted with parting
for ever from all her children, pushed through the crowd, while
the bidding for me was going on, to the spot where her new
master was standing. She fell at his feet, and clung to his knees,
entreating him, in tones that a mother only could command,
to buy her baby as well as herself, and to spare her one of her
little ones at least. Will it, can it be believed, that this man, thus
appealed to, was capable not merely of turning a deaf ear to her
supplication, but to disengage himself from her with such
violent blows and kicks, as reduce her to the necessity of
creeping out of his reach, and mingling the groan of bodily
suffering with the sob of a breaking heart? Yet this
was one of my earliest observations of men, and experience
which has been common to me with thousands of my race, the
bitterness of which its frequency cannot diminish to any
individual who suffers it, while it is dark enough to overshadow
the whole after-life with something blacker than a funeral pall.”</p>

          <div3 type="subchapter">
            <head>WILLIAM WELLS BROWN</head>
            <p>was born in Lexington city, Kentucky state, in or about the year
1820; his mother's owner was Dr. Young, a tobacco planter, his
father a white man, a near relative of that gentleman, whose
disposition, if we may judge from the treatment of his slaves,
was cruel and vindictive. “My mother,” says Brown, “was a
field hand, and many a time has my heart bled to witness the
stripes to which she was subjected.” One morning, he tells us,
was particularly impressed upon his memory, when his
mother being ten minutes behind her time in the field, that time
being half-past four, he heard, as he lay in bed, the crack of the
whip of plaited cow-hide and wire as it fell upon her naked
back, and listened chilled with horror to her agonizing cry for
mercy.</p>
            <p>When Brown was about fifteen years old, a stout and hearty
<pb id="adams122" n="122"/>
lad, Dr. Young sold off his tobacco plantation, and removed to
the of St. Louis, soon after which removal he hired out his Negro
lad to a Major Freeland, who kept a public house, and was a
horse-racer, cock-fighter, gambler, and drunkard. He had about
twenty slaves in his house, and used to amuse himself with
what he called Virginia play; this consisted in tying up in the
smoke-house one of the miserable creatures placed in his power,
and whipping him severely, then nearly suffocating him with a fire
of tobacco stems which he caused to be lighted around him. The
Major had a son named Robert, aged about eighteen, and by him 
too this exciting sport was much relished. Many were the scenes of
horrible cruelty witnessed by Brown while in this man's house and 
service, from which he attempted to escape, but being taken, had to
undergo his share of whipping and smoking. A failure in
business led to a transfer of the Negro's service from Freeland to
the master of a Mississipi steam-boat named Culver, who
appears to have been a humane master; with him, however,
Brown did not remain long, his engagement only lasting till the
close of the navigation season. His next master was Mr. John
Colburn, keeper of the Missouri Hotel, a true “nigger hater,”
although a native of a free state. While in his employment Brown's
mother, brothers, and sisters were sold by Young to different
persons in St. Louis, and thus the family were permanently divided.</p>
            <p>After remaining awhile at the Hotel, our hero was engaged
by Mr. Lovejoy to assist in the printing office of the <hi rend="italics">St.
Louis Times</hi>, of which he was proprietor. Here he was well
treated and allowed leisure for recreation and instruction, of
which he did not fail to avail himself; being naturally sharp
and intelligent, he acquired considerable knowledge, and would
no doubt have done much more to improve his natural gifts,
had not an unfortunate accident put an end to his engagement
with Mr. Lovejoy, when he had not been above a year in
his service<corr sic="missing period">.</corr> Having to convey a form of types from another
printing office to that of his master, Brown was set upon by
a number of white boys, who had seen with jealousy the
confidence reposed in the young nigger, and his
opportunities of self-instruction. He was so severely
handled as to be obliged to fly and leave his types in the street;
nor was this all, for having presumed in self-defence to strike, as
it was asserted, one of his assailants, the father of the lad inflicted
on him so severe a chastisement as to lay him on a sick bed for
five weeks, in which space his place at the printing office had to
be filled up.</p>
            <pb id="adams123" n="123"/>
            <p>When sufficiently recovered to be actively employed, he
again went on board a Mississipi steamer, this time as waiter:
here the idea of attempting his escape seems to have occupied
his mind; his thoughts upon this subject were communicated to
his mother and sister, and pledged himself not to make the
attempt without them. No opportunity, however, occurring
before the end of the season, Brown went back to his owner,
Dr. Young, and resumed his employment on the farm; he was
then hired out to one Walker, a Negro speculator, or “soul
driver,” as the slaves emphatically called him, and as he tells us,
his soul would often sicken at the sights he was obliged to
witness and take part in, and indeed well it might. His
resolution to escape was revived and strengthened: still he
waited for an opportunity of taking his mother with him, and
at the end of another year, which was the term of his
engagement with Walker, went back to Dr. Young, who stated
his intention to sell him, and stating that his price would be five
hundred dollars, gave him a week's liberty to endeavour to find
a purchaser. This was a chance not to be thrown away: his
sister was in safe keeping, and could not join him, but his
mother shared in the hardships and perils of the undertaking;
for ten days they pushed on with hopes that grew brighter at
each step, but, alas! on the eleventh they were taken and led
back to bondage: the poor mother was sent off to New Orleans
with a gang of fifty or sixty slaves going south to be “used up”
on the plantations, and her heart-broken son never set eyes on
her again.</p>
            <p>Brown himself was soon after sold to a Mr. Willie, from
whom he passed into the hands of Captain Price, whose lady,
for whom he filled the office of coachman, took considerable
interest in his welfare; she persuaded him to marry a coloured
<sic corr="proteacutegeacutee">protegee</sic> and slave of hers named Eliza, which he did the better to
disguise his intention of ultimate escape. At length the wished-for
opportunity came: he took advantage of a dark night and
fled, guided by the north star, the fugitive slave's only true and
safe guide, through innumerable dangers and difficulties. How
many a trembling runaway has looked up to that bright speck in
the dusky heavens with hope and confidence, as though it had
been the finger of God pointing out the way to freedom and safety.
Beautifully has Pierpont, in his Ode to the North Star, expressed
the thoughts which may well be supposed to arise in the breast of
the flying slave at the sight of this harbinger of hope. We are
tempted to quote one stanza of this spirited poem:—</p>
            <pb id="adams124" n="124"/>
            <lg type="verse">
              <l>“Star of the North! while blazing day</l>
              <l>Pours round me its full tide of light,</l>
              <l>And hides thy pale and faithful ray,</l>
              <l>I, too, lie hid, and long for night.</l>
              <l>For night—I dare not walk at noon,</l>
              <l>Nor dare I trust the faithless moon,</l>
              <l>Nor faithless man, whose burning lust</l>
              <l>For gold hath riveted my chain;</l>
              <l>No other leader can I trust</l>
              <l>But thee, of even the starry train;</l>
              <l>For all the host around thee burning,</l>
              <l>Like faithless man, keep turning, turning.”</l>
            </lg>
            <p>After long and tedious journeying in darkness, and hunger,
and terrors of all kinds, our fugitive, who was essentially
assisted by a good man named Wells Brown, reached Canada,
and penetrated with gratitude, adopted the name of his
benefactor, adding to it the surname of William, by which
he had been hitherto chiefly known.</p>
            <p>Since the recovery of his freedom, Brown has devoted his
best energies to the cause of emancipation, in which cause he
has laboured, and is still labouring, with extraordinary zeal and
assiduity. He has also made great efforts to remedy the defects
of his early life with regard to education, and that these have not
been unsuccessful we have sufficient proof in the volumes
published by him in this country, the one being a narrative of his
life and escape from slavery, and the other bearing the title
“Three years in Europe; or Places I have seen, and People I have
met.” A fine intelligent-looking man is W. Brown, who is, or was
very lately, frequently to be seen in the busy thoroughfares of 
London, he having come to this country, like Henson, Pennington,
and others, to plead the cause of his coloured brethren. His
grand motto is<hi rend="italics"> “Slavery cannot be let alone. It is aggressive and
must either be succumbed to or put down.”</hi></p>

          <div3 type="subchapter">
            <head>HENRY BIBB.</head>
            <p>HENRY BIBB was the eldest of seven brothers, all sons of
the bondwoman, and sufferers of some of the worst evils and
cruel inflictions of American Slavery, which, as Mrs. Stowe
fully proves in the fourteenth chapter of her “Key to Uncle
Tom's Cabin,” is a very different system from that sanctioned
under the Mosaic law, on which pro-slavery writers and
preachers are accustomed to base their arguments in defence of
the “peculiar institution.” Henry Bibb does not know who
<pb id="adams125" n="125"/>
his father was; that his mother was a slave was sufficient to
decide his lot, and to send him, under fear of the lash, while yet
a mere infant, to labour on his master's farm: when sufficiently
old to be of much use to any one, he was hired out to one
person and another for the space of eight or ten years, the
proceeds of his labour going, we are told, to defray the expense
of educating his owner's daughters. The year of Henry Bibb's
birth was a memorable one—1815; little, however, knew he of
European struggles; he had a great battle of his own to fight
against tremendous odds, and he seems to have fought it
bravely. He formed the determination to be free at a very early
age, and nothing could shake it; starvation, imprisonment,
scourging, lacerating, punishments of every kind, and of every
degree of severity short of actual death, were tried in vain; they
could not subdue his indomitable spirit.</p>
            <p>His first attempt to escape was made when he was about ten
years of age, and from that time to 1840 his life was a constant
series of flights and recaptures, the narrative of which makes
one thrill and shudder at the sufferings endured and the
barbarities inflicted. It is not our purpose to enter into any
detail of these, as they can be found in an easily accessible form
elsewhere,<ref id="ref15" n="15" rend="sc" target="note15" targOrder="U">* </ref>but one or two incidents of this exciting narrative
we must briefly dwell upon. And first let us observe what a
true and loving heart had this despised Negro! He became
attached to, and married, a beautiful Mulatto girl named
Malinda, by whom he had a daughter, little Frances, and again
and again, after he was out of the reach of his pursuers, and
might have made good his escape to where no slaveholder dare
claim him, did he return to the spot which contained his earthly
treasures, hovering about them in the black midnight, and
concerting measures for their release from slavery, although
he knew it was like running into the jaws of death, and
of bondage worse than death. Foes were around him on 
every side, exasperated, thirsting for revenge; every hand against
him; every tongue ready to betray him; but what cared he? He
<hi rend="italics">must</hi> look upon these dear ones again; he <hi rend="italics">must</hi> speak words of
comfort to them, and clasp them once more in his arms, if he
died in the attempt.</p>
            <p>Tell us not of high, chivalrous deeds—of the courage, and
prowess, and daring of those excited by the smiles of beauty or
the expectation of renown, but look at this poor Negro,
friendless and alone, venturing back into that horrible pit
<note id="note15" n="15" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref15">*  Vide “Uncle Tom's Companions.”</note>
<pb id="adams126" n="126"/>
of suffering out of which he had barely escaped with his
life;—he who had passed through such a fiery ordeal of
misery, who had been sunk so deeply into the slough of
moral degradation, that one would have supposed that every
gentler affection, every noble feeling, must have been destroyed
within him, even if such had ever been able to struggle into
birth,—think of such as he turning back from his place of
security, and—not casting away fear; he could not do this;
he was in deadly terror the whole time—but led by a love
stronger than even that absorbing fear, going back to the
spot where his capture was almost certain, and his cruel and
ignominious death more than probable. Verily, in all the
records of high-souled humanity we know of nothing more
sublime than this. And Henry Bibb is not the only Negro
by many, of whom as much might be said, as will have been
observed by those who have perused the previous chapters
of this work. Pity that such love and devotion did not meet
with its appropriate reward; all his efforts to rescue Malinda
were unsuccessful, and although for a long time she bore
stripes and imprisonments and many cruel inflictions rather
than prove unfaithful to him, yet in the end was her virtue
overcome, by what means we are left to conjecture. The last
time Bibb returned to the scene of his former bondage and
sufferings, which was in 1845, she was living a life of shame
and infamy in the house of a white man who had become
her owner by purchase; her child was with her, and now
between them and her husband there was a great gulf which
he, noble and true-hearted as he was, could not attempt
to pass.</p>
            <p>Another incident in the life of our hero should be mentioned,
as it throws a strong light upon his integrity of character. His
last owner was an Indian of the Cherokee tribe, who bought him
for nine hundred dollars of a party of sportsmen whose slave
and attendant he was for a time. This Indian was a humane and
indulgent master, and although a poor benighted heathen,
seemed to understand more of the great law of humanity than
the Christian (?) men whose tender mercies Bibb had
experienced. He placed great confidence in his slave, gave him a
horse to ride, and entrusted him with a money-bag full of gold
and silver. And these were chains which the Negro could by no
means find it in his heart to break. He had previously made up
his mind to escape, but the good Cherokee defeated his purpose
by giving him the means and affording him the opportunity to do so!
Strange this! but a truth nevertheless: ponder on it, Oh
<pb id="adams127" n="127"/>
slaveholder of the south! and believe that there is something of
goodness even in the breast of a Negro!</p>
            <p>The old chief fell ill, and Bibb watched over him day and
night, soothed his last hours, and after he was dead prepared his
body for the tomb. Then, and not till then, did he commence
once more his oft-interrupted pilgrimage towards
the land of freedom. Through the wild Indian country he went,
and amid the painted savages: here he was comparatively
safe, for the slave-hunter came not here, and no one
thought of betraying him for a base bribe. We must not,
however, longer dwell upon his history. Henry Bibb is now a
free man—a Christian man—devoting his best energies to the cause
of his countrymen in chains<sic corr="period">,</sic> He too has been in this country to
convince us that the prejudice which exists, even here, in many
minds against a black skin is as unreasonable as it is
unscriptural. He is one of the LIVING WITNESSES who now stand
upon the great platform of universal humanity demanding, in
language as dignified as it is convincing, a recognition of the right
of the Negro to be admitted into the family circle of nations
upon terms of equality. Other examples we might adduce—many
others—did space permit: there is</p>

            <head>HENRY HIGHLAND GARNET.</head>
            <p>THIS tall, fine-looking gentlemanly man of colour; the
eloquent preacher and debator; the ordained minister of the
gospel; who is, or was lately, in this country—once a slave, and
still a slave in the eye of American law. When about eight years
of age, his father, mother, sister, and himself, with eight other
escaped slaves, found an asylum in the free state of New York;
there they remained about seven years, at the end of which
time the family circle was broken up by the intrusion of the
man-stealers, who had discovered their hiding-place; they all,
however, escaped, but there was no longer rest nor safety for
them there. Henry happened at the time to be away in a vessel,
on board of which he served as cabin-boy, and did not receive
the intelligence of the persecution of his family until his return
from the voyage. He shortly after entered the African Free
School at New York, where, we are told, he soon reached the
highest class. He was then admitted into a school of a more
advanced character, but here the coloured boys were not
permitted to mingle with those of fairer skins, and consequently
their opportunities of acquiring knowledge were limited. Garnet,
in 1835, travelled to New Hampshire, and entered Canaan
<pb id="adams128" n="128"/>
Academy, from whence he and some other Negroes were driven
by a mob, who burned the house in which they resided. The
next year he repaired to the Oneida Institute, desiring to prepare
himself for the Gospel ministry; he was well received by the
professors and students, and soon won their esteem for his character, and
admiration for his abilities. Having graduated at the Whilestown
School in 1840, and received his diploma, he was finally
ordained a minister of the Presbyterian Church, from which
church, however, he retired in 1847, on account of its connexion
with slavery. </p>
            <p>This is a very brief outline of his career He is a man
undoubtedly of high intellectual powers; his pulpit discourses
have in them much of real poetry as well as fervent piety; and
his political and other addresses are described as most
powerful to sway the hearts of his hearers, especially those of
his own kindred and complexion, on whose past and present
condition and future destiny, he has published an able treatise.
He is a strenuous advocate for freedom, temperance, education,
and all that can elevate and refine the human mind; and may be
looked upon as altogether one of the choice spirits of the age.
The island of Jamaica is understood to be his future field of
missionary operations; to free, enlightened, republican
America, while the Fugitive Slave Law is in existence, it would
not be safe for him to return.</p>

            <head>MOSES ROPER,</head>
            <p>we may just allude to, although we have some doubts if he
is yet living; he came into this country, as a place of refuge,
in 1835. His published narrative, the truth of which there
seems no reason to doubt, is full of the most thrilling and
startling incidents. He was a native of Caswell county, North
Carolina, in which state and South Carolina, his slave-life was
passed. Mary Howitt sweetly sings—</p>
            <lg type="verse">
              <l>“Fair befal the cotton plant,</l>
              <l>Bravely may it grow;</l>
              <l>Bearing in its seedy pod</l>
              <l>Cotton white as snow.”</l>
            </lg>
            <p>But, oh! how deeply is that cotton dyed in human blood
before it reaches the Manchester market; there is a stain
in it which no bleaching will ever take out. Nothing has so
forcibly impressed us with this truth as the perusal of Roper's
<pb id="adams129" n="129"/>
narrative. Well might the poor slave make the most desperate
efforts to escape from such a Pandemonium as the
cotton plantation is represented to be. Roper's run-away
excursions were even more numerous than those of Garnet, and
the punishments, consequent on them, of course more frequent.
One wonders how the human frame could sustain such a
merciless infliction of tortures of every kind; assuredly
a horse or a dog must have died under them; but wonderful are
the powers of endurance in man, especially Negroes! Moses
Roper tells us that on one occasion, when he was overtaken by
his pursuers, and unmercifully beaten near a planter's residence,
the lady of the house came out, and begged that he might not be
killed <hi rend="italics">so near the house:</hi> killed he might be, so that it were out
of sight, and with a due regard to public decency. All planters'
ladies, however, are not so sensitive; according to the testimony
of Roper, and other sufferers, the mistress sometimes directs in
person the most degrading and brutal punishment of her slaves,
if she does not inflict it with her own hand. Roper's woolly hair
was the only indication of his being a Negro; his skin was as
fair as that of many white men.</p>

            <p>with whom we must close our list—leaving unnoticed many
Living Witnesses of Negro ability—is a pure African, and a
striking example of what such can become by religious and
literary culture. He is one of the only four Episcopally-
ordained coloured clergymen of the United States. In 1848 he
visited England, and spoke at the annual meeting of the Anti-
Slavery Society in London. He also, by permission of the Bishop
of the diocese, preached, in St. George's Church, Liverpool,
<pb id="adams130" n="130"/>
a sermon on the text “That they which have believed in God
might be careful to maintain good works.” (Titus, iii. 8,) and
filled his numerous auditors with wonder at his attainments,
and admiration at his christian and philanthropic views.</p>
            <p>We cannot better conclude this chapter than by quoting a
portion of his noble “Eulogy on the Life and Character of Thomas
Clarkson,” which was delivered at New York in 1847, and
afterwards published in a pamphlet extending to forty closely-
printed octavo pages. The man who could utter such sentiments
in such language belongs to no inferior race. Listen to him and be
convinced, oh, doubters of Negro capacity! Addressing his coloured
brethren he says, “Let us not be unmindful of the prerogatives and
obligations arising from the fact, that the exhibition of the greatest
talent, and the development of the most enlarged philanthropy in the
nineteenth century have been bestowed upon our race. The
names of the great lights of the age—Statesmen, Poets, and
Divines, in all the great countries of Europe, and in this
country, too, are inseparably connected with the cause and
destiny of the African race. This has been the theme whence
most of them have reaped honour and immortality. This
cause has produced the development of the most noble character
of modern times:—has given the world a Wilberforce and a
Clarkson. Lowly and depressed as we have been, and
as we now are, yet <hi rend="italics">our</hi> interests and <hi rend="italics">our</hi> welfare, have agitated
the chief countries of the world, and are now before all other
questions, shaking this nation to its very centre. The providences of
God have placed the Negro race before Europe and America in the
most commanding position. From the sight of us, no nation, no
statesman, no ecclesiastic, and no ecclesiastical institution, can escape.
And by us and our cause the character and greatness of individuals
and of nations in this day and generation of the world are to be decided,
either for good or evil: and so, in all coming times, the memory and the
fame of the chief actors now on the stage will be decided by their
relation to our cause. The discoveries of Science, the unfoldings of
Literature, the dazzlings of Genius, all fade before the demands of
this cause. This is the age of BROTHERHOOD AND HUMANITY,
and the Negro race is its most distinguished test and criterion.</p>
            <p>And for what are all these providences? For nothing? He who
thinks so must be blinded—must be demented. In these facts are
wound up a most distinct significance, and with them are
connected most clear and emphatic obligations and
responsibilities. The clear-minded and thoughtful coloured
<pb id="adams131" n="131"/>
men of America must mark the significance of these facts, and
begin to feel their weight. For more than two centuries we have
been working our way from the deep and dire degradation into
which Slavery had plunged us. We have made considerable
headway. By the vigorous use of the opportunities of our partial
freedom we have been enabled, with the Divine blessing, to reach a
position of respectability and character. We have pressed
somewhat into the golden avenues of Science, Intelligence, and
Learning. We have made impressions there; and some few of our
foot-prints have we left behind. The mild light of Religion has
illumined our pathway, and Superstition and Error have fled
apace. The greatest paradoxes are evinced by us. Amid the decay
of nations, a rekindled light starts up in us. Burdens under
which others expire, seem to have lost their influence upon us;
and, while <hi rend="italics">they</hi> are ‘driven to the wall,’ destruction keeps far
from <hi rend="italics">us</hi> its blasting hand. We live in the region of death, yet
seem hardly mortal. We cling to life in the midst of all reverses;
and our nerveful grasp thereon cannot easily be relaxed. History
reverses its mandates in our behalf:—our dotage is in the past.
‘Time writes not its wrinkles on our brow;’ our juvenescence is in
the future. All this, with the kindly nature which is
acknowledgedly ours—with gifts of freedom vouchsafed us by the
Almighty in this land, in part, and in the West Indies; with the
intellectual desire everywhere manifesting itself, and the
exceeding interest exhibited for Africa by her own children, and
by the christian nations of the world, are indications from which
we may not gather a trivial meaning, nor a narrow significance.</p>
            <p>The teaching of God in all these things, is, undoubtedly, that
ours is a great destiny, and that we should open our eyes to it.
God is telling us all that whereas the past has been dark grim,
and repulsive, the future shall be glorious; that the horrid traffic
shall yet be entirely staunched; that the whips and brands, the
shackles and fetters of slavery shall be cast down to oblivion;
that the shades of ignorance and superstition that have so long
settled down upon the mind of Africa shall be dispelled; and that
all her sons on her own broad continent, in the Western Isles, and
in this Republic, shall yet stand erect beneath the heavens;
<q direct="unspecified"><lg><l>“With freedom chartered on their manly brows;”</l></lg></q>
their bosoms swelling with its noblest raptures—treading the
face of Earth in the links of Brotherhood and Equality, and
<pb id="adams132" n="132"/>
in the possession of an enlarged and glorious Liberty.</p>
            <p>May we be equal to these providences, may we prove
deserving of such a destiny! God grant that when at some future
day our ransomed and cultivated posterity shall stand where we
now stand, and bear the burdens that we now bear, and reap the
fruits of our foresight, our virtues, and our endeavours. And may 
they have the proud satisfaction of knowing that we, their ancestors,
uncultured and unlearned, amid all trials and temptations, were men
of integrity, recognized with gratefulness their truest friends
dishonoured and in peril—were enabled to resist the seductions of
ease and the intimidations of power—were true to themselves, the
age in which they lived, their abject race, and the cause of man—
shrank not from trial, nor from suffering; but conscious of
responsibility, and impelled by duty, gave themselves up to the
vindication of the high hopes and the lofty aim of TRUE
HUMANITY.”</p>

          <head>CONCLUDING CHAPTER<lb/>
OF ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE,<lb/>
COMMUNICATED IN A LETTER TO THE EDITOR<lb/>
BY WILSON ARMISTEAD.</head>
          <opener>
            <salute>My DEAR FRIEND;</salute>
          </opener>
          <p>Very gladly do I acquiesce in thy
request to furnish a concluding chapter of additional evidence in
support of the position that all mankind, of whatever clime or
colour, are originally endowed with those mental capabilities
which, by cultivation, are not only amply sufficient to obtain
the comforts and conveniences of civilized life, but also to enable
them to fulfil those social, civil, and religious duties which
attach to man, as the only accountable being on earth—whether
towards his fellow-being as a citizen of the world, or to that
Supreme Being who has conferred upon him those noble
faculties.</p>
          <p>Greatly shall I rejoice if I can add anything from my own
observation, or from any other source, that shall assist in
removing that unfounded prejudice which is manifested
towards the most maligned and maltreated portion of the
human family,—that stigma which has fixed itself so 
inveterately upon the Negro race, the result of which is
continued hatred and oppression.</p>
          <p>Man is the creature of circumstances, as we may perceive
from the almost infinite variety of character which everywhere
prevails. Yet, however great this diversity, the true Christian
feels the bond of brotherhood in his fellow-man, of whatever
country, clime, or colour; as possessing the same tendencies in
his nature, the same sympathies, hopes, and fears, the same
susceptibility of pleasure and pain; and, what binds him closer
than all, having the same origin, and the same Almighty
Redeemer.</p>
          <p>Any open or more latent prejudice which may exist or be
cherished on account of a difference in the colour of the skin,
or indeed on account of any other circumstance over which he
has no control, is unworthy the character of the true Christian,
the Philanthropist, or the Philosopher;. and the more we
become practically acquainted with mankind, the more we shall
find that there is in reality no existing cause for such a
prejudice.</p>
          <pb id="adams134" n="134"/>
          <p>But it is alleged the coloured people are degraded and inferior.
To this I would reply, their present equality we do not vindicate,
but their capability we assert without any doubt. The marvel is
that the Negro race is not now more degraded than it is, taking
into account the depressing circumstances to which it has been
subjected. Think of a people for above two hundred years
patiently enduring the bitter infliction of slavery:—</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“Bitterest of all the ills beneath</l>
            <l>Whose load man totters down to death,</l>
            <l>Is that which plucks the regal crown</l>
            <l>Of Freedom from his forehead down,</l>
            <l>And snatches from his powerless hand</l>
            <l>The sceptred sign of self-command;</l>
            <l>Effacing with its chain and rod</l>
            <l>The image and the seal of God:</l>
            <l>While from his changed nature, day by day,</l>
            <l>The manly virtues fade away—</l>
            <l>Pride—honour's instinct—self-respect—</l>
            <l>Till the man, no more erect,</l>
            <l>Creeps earthward, naked, blind, and mute,</l>
            <l>The God-like merging in the brute.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>That the Negro should so remarkably maintain the moral and
intellectual character, when so long subjected to the crushing
influences of slavery, is a matter that may well make other than
black men marvel. It is not saying too much to assert that the
coloured race in the United States have surmounted difficulties
and discouragements which the pride and wickedness of the
Old World never, in its worst periods, employed to arrest the
progress of human improvement.</p>
          <p>What branch of the European family, if held in the same
condition as the Negro in America for two centuries, would not
be equally degraded? If the Whites had themselves been slaves
to a civilized community of Blacks, and had, when emancipated,
been subjected to the same social excommunication to which
they have condemned the free Blacks, it may well be doubted
whether they would not at this moment have been sunk to a
level of civilization and respectability below that to which the
latter have risen.</p>
          <p>Be this as it may, instances of the attainment of a high
degree of intelligence and refinement, although surrounded
by the greatest impediments, exist everywhere in proof of
the entire manhood of the Negro. The truth of an old
and oft-repeated saying, that “Knowledge is Power,” has
been proved again and again. It is by a dissemination of
the real facts of the case, that the claims to full equality
must be substantiated. This
<pb id="adams135" n="135"/>
will do more to destroy hatred towards the coloured people,
by removing the prejudicial feelings entertained against them,
than any theoretical declamation. This volume is already
replete with such facts. The few I shall now furnish in
addition, chiefly as narrated by eye-witnesses, will throw
some further weight into the right scale. May they hasten to
the proscribed a restoration to their proper social and civil
position in society.</p>
          <p>The Negro race have exhibited many remarkable instances
of courage and bravery. They have always evinced a readiness
to exchange domestic slavery for the milder servitude d more
exciting scenes of the army, having less fear of bullets than
stripes. The history of the revolutions in North and South
America—but especially the latter—furnish sufficient proofs
of the truth of this. Being a “peacemaker,” I have little to say
in praise of anything of a warlike nature, but the military
character is a trait which, it must be allowed, cannot be
exhibited by persons of either mental or moral imbecility. I
have recently perused a work entitled “Services of Coloured
Americans in the Wars of 1776 and 1812,” by W. C. Nell,
(himself a coloured American,) which contains ample proof
that the free coloured men of the United States bore their full
proportion of the sacrifices and trials of the revolutionary war.</p>
          <p>It is a fact that in the revolutionary war, the war between
England and the American colonies, half a million of Negroes
were engaged, and they placed their bosoms to the British
musket and cannon as bravely as any who fought. Among
those who shielded the person of George Washington was a
trusty Negro, in whom the general greatly confided. In the battle
of Bunker's Hill, there was a brave Negro who jumped
on the ramparts, and fired nineteen shots, and, as
the Yankees tell, killed a man each time. There was a corps of
soldiers from the state of Pennsylvania, in which was a Negro,
James Forten, (of whom I shall speak again shortly,) who did
his part bravely. In Rhode Island , a British regiment
attacked a white company near where some Blacks were
working. The British were too strong for the Whites, but the
brave Blacks bore down upon and conquered them. This
evinced bravery, and bravery is admired even in an enemy.
Andrew Jackson twice called out a regiment of Blacks.</p>
          <p>When Mr. Pakenham was our minister, he was called upon
to dine in Louisiana, and the Negro who waited upon
him took an occasion, stealthily in the passage, to ask Mr.
<pb id="adams136" n="136"/>
Pakenham whether he was any relation to Sir Edward
Pakenham? On being told that he was his brother, he informed
Mr. Pakenham that he was in the engagement in which Sir
Edward Pakenham fell. The master, on being spoken to, was
quite annoyed that the Negro had addressed Mr. Pakenham, but
said it was quite true,—“Sam was in that engagement, and did
noble deeds.” Mr. Pakenham sent a note with a card for Sam to
dine with him the following day. He did so; and Mr. Pakenham
heard from him particulars which he could obtain from no other
source. That Sam was and is now a slave! for those Negroes
who fought bravely were returned back to <sic corr="slavery">slave</sic></p>
          <p>My friend, Samuel R. Ward, of Canada, in relating this
circumstance in a lecture he recently delivered before the
Cheltenham Literary and Philosophical Society, makes the
following justly indignant comment:—“Here is Anglo-Saxon
honour to the Negro race; these are the people who are so
superior to the race of Ham; these are the people who are
so offended when a Negro comes‘between the wind and their
nobility!’ They ask their assistance in times that try men's
souls and carcases too, hut when the smoke of battle has rolled
over, then the Negro is only fit for a hewer of wood and
drawer of water, and quite inferior to any of the human
family!”</p>
          <p>It is well known that in 1837, when our country was much
disturbed by a rebellion, which called out soldiers in behalf of
the British Government, the Blacks of Canada did their full
share under Colonels Prince and Mc'Nab. It is admitted that
these black soldiers acted their part as bravely as any other
men in the British Canadian army.</p>
          <p>Let us now pass southward. For same account of the
Negro General, Toussaint, the hero of St. Domingo, the
reader must refer to previous pages of this volume, where
may also be found a passing notice of Henry Diaz, who,
though like Toussaint, once a Negro slave, became Colonel
of a regiment of soldiers of his own colour. Diaz was
certainly one of the most remarkable men of his age, and
as his case affords strong evidence in support of our position,
I may include the following particulars, as given by
an American writer:—</p>
          <p>In the course of a long and harrassing war with their Dutch
masters, the Brazilians had become fatigued, and their resources
nearly exhausted. In the midst of their despondency, a stout,
active, negro slave, named Henry Diaz, presented himself in the
Brazilian camp. With the air and tone of
<pb id="adams137" n="137"/>
one whose purpose had been deliberately formed, he proposed
to the Commander, John Fernandez, to raise a regiment of his
own colour, and bring them to the rescue of their common
country. Although the Portuguese, and other nations of the
south of Europe, had never indulged toward the coloured race
those rancorous prejudices which exist in the United States, yet
the sudden appearance, and singular proposal of this intrepid
negro, occasioned no small surprise among the Portuguese
officers. The arrival of Joan of Arc in the camp of Charles the
Seventh could scarcely have produced more wonder. But
Diaz, though an enthusiast, made an pretension to miracles. He
was well acquainted with the character of his race; and he relied
upon his own influence, and tact, to develope the great qualities,
which he well knew they possessed. Their situation was indeed
wretched and degraded in the extreme; but he had occasionally
seen in them, as he felt within himself, a capacity for high and
noble deeds.</p>
          <p>When a beggar is offered silver, he is not likely to be very
fastidious about the stamp of the coin; and thus it was with the
Portuguese Commander. He readily accepted the proposal of
Diaz; but with an incredulous smile, that plainly implied he
considered it no harm for the blackies to try; just as a father
looks and speaks to little boys, when they ask to hold the
plough.</p>
          <p>Diaz returned triumphantly to his companions, to
communicate the success of his mission. He exhibited the
parchment he had received; and though few could read the
words, all were able to appreciate the magnitude of the seals,
and the magnificence of the flourishes. The regiment was soon
full and organized into regular batallions and companies.
Such was the talent and energy of Diaz, and such effective use
had he made of the hours he was enabled to steal from labour
and from sleep, that in less than two months his troops were
completely equipped, and in as perfect a state of discipline as
the oldest corps of the army. From miserable, ragged, servile
creatures, they had suddenly started up into brave and stout
men, their faces animated with intelligence and hope, and their
eyes glistening like the flashing of the sun upon their bright
muskets.</p>
          <p>By the fierce and unyielding courage of this regiment, and the
genius and skill of its commander, the Dutch were repeatedly
defeated, after the most severe contests. The soldiers were never
but once known to waver from the rock-like firmness said to
distinguish coloured troops. Once,
<pb id="adams138" n="138"/>
when struggling against a vast superiority of numbers, there was
a momentary relaxation of their efforts, and some symptoms of
dismay. Their Colonel rushed into the midst of the breaking
ranks, and exclaiming “Are these the brave companions of
Henry Diaz!” he restored their confidence, and secured the
victory. By a new and desperate charge, the enemy was
completely routed.</p>
          <p>After eight years of almost constant warfare, the Dutch were
driven from that vast territory, which now forms the empire of
Brazil. Of all those rich possessions, which they had expended
millions to conquer, by land and by sea,—and which their avarice
and cruelty had too long desolated,—nothing finally remained,
but one large, and apparently impregnable fortress, called Cinco
Pontas, near Pernambuco. It commanded the whole city and
neighbourhood, and was well provisioned, and garrisoned by an
army of five thousand men. Many useless attempts were made to
get possession of this important post. It was defended by high and
massive walls, and by deep and wide ditches, containing
twelve feet of water; and provisions being constantly supplied
from Dutch ships, there was no hope of reducing it by famine.
Every fresh attack upon it was immediately punished by
pouring its powerful batteries on the city and surrounding
country. While the enemy possessed this strong-hold the
Brazilians were subject to continual irritations and alarm, and
could never regard their dear-bought independence as secure.</p>
          <p>Here was a subject fit to employ the bold genius and
unwearied energy of Henry Diaz! He sent an officer to the
Commander in Chief, requesting an audience, that he might
communicate a plan for taking the Cinco Pontas. The General
readily granted this request; but with a still smaller hope of any
favourable result, than he had entertained, when the slave first
proposed his recruiting scheme.</p>
          <p>Diaz detailed his plan with characteristic earnestness. The
superior officers listened respectfully; for his well earned
reputation effectually protected the speaker from open derision.
The result of the conference was, that the General declined
adopting the measures proposed, but had no objection that Diaz
himself should carry them into effect, with the troops under his
command. “Then,” replied the brave Colonel, “to-morrow at
sunrise, you shall see the Portuguese flag wave on the tower of
Cinco Pontas!”</p>
          <p>As Diaz retired he overheard his commander say to one of the
officers, “It is a nigger plan.” Diaz took no notice of the
scornful remark, but made preparations for his hazardous
<pb id="adams139" n="139"/>
enterprise with all possible secrecy and despatch. His
men were ordered to lay aside their muskets, to retain their
side-arms,—to take a pair of pistols in their belts, and to 
carry upon their shoulders a heap of wood tightly bound
together with osier bands. Thus prepared, at two o'clock in
the morning, he gave directions to march towards the fort. The
night was dark, and the column arrived at their destination in
perfect safety. Silently and rapidly they deposited their
bundles in the deep trench, beginning at the outer margin, and
building successive layers towards the wall. As fast
as this operation was performed, they filed off, and formed
companies, in readiness to scale the wall, as soon as this combined
bridge and ladder should be completed. They were obliged to wait
but a brief period. The Roman warriors could not have buried the
parricide woman under their shields with more celerity, than the
soldiers of Diaz filled up the fosse, and formed an ascent to the wall.</p>
          <p>Diaz was the first to leap upon the ramparts. The first
sentinel he met he laid dead at his feet. The garrison were
sleeping; and before they were completely roused, the
Brazilians had gained the greater part of the fortress. As soon as
the Dutch recovered a little from their first surprise and confusion,
they formed a compact phalanx, and offered desperate resistance.
Diaz received a sabre wound, which shattered the bones
of his arm about the wrist. It was necessary to staunch
the blood, which flowed profusely. Finding that it would take
the surgeon some time to adjust the bones, and arrange the
dressing, he bade him cut off the hand, saying, “It is of less
consequence to me than a few moments time, just now.” This
being done, he again rushed into the hottest of the
fight; and although the Dutch had greatly the advantage in the
use of their artillery and muskets, they could not long
withstand the determined bravery of their assailants. Fighting
hand to hand, they soon killed or captured the whole garrison,
and took possession of their immense stores of provision and
ammunition.</p>
          <p>When the darkness and smoke cleared away, the Portuguese flag
was seen waving from the tower of Cinco Pontas! The
Commander-in-Chief could scarcely believe the evidence of his
own senses. The intrepid Diaz sent an aid-de-camp to say that
the fort and provisions were at the disposition of his
Excellency. In a few hours the General, with a numerous suit,
entered the fortress, and was saluted by the victorious troops.
They found Colonel Diaz reclining on his camp bed, enfeebled
by exertion and loss of blood. He
<pb id="adams140" n="140"/>
however raised himself to a sitting posture, and received the
thanks and congratulations of his commanding and brother
officers, with the grave and placid air habitual to him. Then
looking up archly, and not having forgotten the General's
scornful remark, he said, “It was a nigger plan General,
but the fort is taken.”</p>
          <p>At the request of John the Fourth, Colonel Diaz visited
Portugal, where he was received with great distinction. The king
desired him to choose any reward within his power to bestow.
Diaz merely requested that his regiment might be perpetuated
and none admitted to its ranks but those of his own colour. This
was granted; and a considerable town and territory were
appropriated to secure pensions to these brave men and their
successors. The town is called Estancia, and is situated a short
distance from Pernambuco. </p>
          <p>The king conferred knighthood upon Diaz, and caused a medal
to be struck in commemoration of the capture of Cinco Pontas.
It was likewise ordained that the regiment should for ever bear
the name of its first commander. It still exists in Pernambuco.
Its uniform is white, faced with red, and embroidered with gold.
The decorations which Diaz received from John the Fourth, are
transmitted to the commander of the regiment to this day; and at
royal audiences they have the privilege of being the first to kiss
the sovereign's hand.</p>
          <p>Leaving the New World for a while, allow me to introduce a
Negro whose courage was tested in the milder climes of Europe.
General Dumas, the father of the present Alexandre Dumas, one
of Napoleon's best and bravest generals, was a Mulatto. Near
Lisle, Dumas, with four men, attacked a post of fifty Austrians,
killed six, and made sixteen prisoners. For a long time he
commanded a legion of horse, composed of Blacks and Mulattoes,
who were the terror of their enemies. General Dumas was with the
army which Napoleon drove over the Alps; Napoleon crossed it in
June, Marshall Mc'Donald in December. The latter sent to Dumas
to say it was impossible to pass in the winter, when great avalanches
of snow were falling down, threatening to destroy the army. Napoleon's
reply was,—“Go, and tell Marshall Mc'Donald, where one man
can pass over, an army can pass over in single file; the order is
not to be countermanded.” The order was obeyed, though at the
cost of many lives. One of the generals that made the pass was
the black General Dumas, who ascended the St. Bernard, which
was defended by a number
<pb id="adams141" n="141"/>
of fortifications, took possession of the cannon, and immediately
directed them against the enemy. The son of this brave General
of Napoleon's, the present Alexandre Dumas, is the most prolific
romance writer of the age. He is now above fifty years old, and
for some thirty years has been known as a writer. During this
time he has published more novels, plays, travels, and historical
sketches than any other man that ever lived. It is well understood
that he is not the author of all the works that appear under his name,
but that young writers gain a living by working out the plots and
situations that his fecund brain suggests; when the novel or the
play is complete, Dumas gives it a revision, touches up the
dialogue, dashes in here and there a spirited scene of his own,
and then receives from the publisher an enormous sum, which
he incontinently squanders.</p>
          <p>Undeniably a man of genius, endowed with true fertility of
imagination, and masterly power of expression, it must be
acknowledged that we look in vain through the whole range of
his productions for a noble work of art. Corrupt in ideas, and
unscrupulous and reckless in purpose, he has impressed upon
his plays and romances the melancholy stamp of a dissolute
civilization; they glitter in the tinsel of theatrical sentiment, that
sets off, but does not pretend to hide the most monstrous, and
often the most repulsive conceptions. Always writing slap-dash
for publication next morning, the haste of composition
does not allow him to elaborate or to correct his work into
artistic proportion and consistency, and it launches upon the
world as crude and faulty as the hastily combined products of
half a dozen pens, all driven at railroad speed to earn the writer's
stipend and the employer's profit, needs must be. But at the same time,
such is the vivacity of his descriptions, such the entrain of his narrative,
such the boldness of his invention, such the point of his
dialogue, and the rapidity of his incidents, so matchless often
the felicity and skill of particular passages, that he always
inflames the interest of the reader to the end. You may be angry
with him, you may find him guilty of every literary and every
personal fault, but you will confess that he is the opposite of
tedious. Certainly no writer fills a more prominent place
in the literature of his country; and none has exercised a more
potent if, not always pernicious influence upon its recent
development than this son of the Negro General Dumas.</p>
          <p>“Dumas,” says Ward, “was once asked by an impertinent
<pb id="adams142" n="142"/>
fellow who his ancestors were. What his father was? He said a
Mulatto. And what was your grandfather? A Negro. And what
was your great grandfather? An ape;—my paternity begins where
yours has ended.”</p>
          <p>Among the numerous coloured citizens, whose respectability
was “the glory and the shame” of Philadelphia, was one well
known throughout the Union for the wealth he possessed, and
the probity and urbanity which marked his character in public
and private life. “The history of James Forten,” writes E. S.
Abdy, “such as I had from his own lips, while sitting at his
hospitable board, is somewhat remarkable. He is descended from
a family that has resided in Pennsylvania one hundred and
seventy years; and does not, so far as he has been able to
ascertain, number one slave among its members. He himself took
an active part in the revolutionary war, and fell into the hands
of the enemy, while serving in the Royal Louis, under the father
of the celebrated Decatur. It was in 1780 that this vessel was
captured by the Amphion, commanded by Sir John Beezley. Sir
John's son, who was then a midshipman, about the same age as
young Forten, was one day playing at marbles on the deck;
when the latter, who had been employed to pick them up,
exhibited such superior skill, after the game was over, in
'knuckling down,' and hitting the object aimed at, that the young
Englishman was delighted with him. The acquaintance soon 
ripened into a sort of intimacy; and his generous friend offered, if
he would accompany him to England, to provide for his
education, and assist him in procuring some respectable
occupation.</p>
          <p>“The young Africo-American, however, preferred serving
his country, small as the chance was that he would ever
recover his liberty, to the brilliant career thus placed before
him; and he was ultimately transferred to the prison ship,
the Old Jersey, of sixty-four guns, then lying in the East
River, where the New York navy-yard now is. Sir John's
son was so affected at parting, that he shed tears; and
having obtained from his father a protection for him against
enlistment, saved him from the wretched fate which befel
many of his brethren, who were carried by their captors to
the West Indies, and sold there as slaves. He remained
in confinement seven months, till he was sent home in
exchange. During the period of his detention, no less than
three thousand five hundred prisoners fell victims to an
epidemic which the crowded state of the vessel occasioned. 
The average number on board was one thousand five hundred.
<pb id="adams143" n="143"/>
When the war was over, Forten went to London, where he
remained a year; and on his return to his native land, obtained
employment in the sail loft which is now his own property,
and which has witnessed his industry and enterprise for more
than forty-six years. In his business as a sail-maker, he is
generally considered to stand ,above competition.</p>
          <p>“No citizen ought to be more honoured in his own country
than James Forten, if to be instrumental in saving human life
give a title to respect. No less than twelve fellow-creatures owe
their existence to him; for that is the number of persons he has
saved with his own hands from drowning—I believe they were
all whites. That circumstance, however, would have no
influence upon his humanity. His workshop being on the banks
of the river, he has frequent opportunities of exercising his
philanthropy at the risk of his life. There was hanging up in his
sitting-room, an honourable testimony to his successful efforts
in rescuing four men from a watery grave. This heir-loom, for
which he would not take a thousand dollars, was presented to
him in 1821, by the Humane Society of Philadelphia. It consists
of an engraving, in which is represented the rescue of a female
from the waves; and a written attestation, signed by the
President and Secretary, with the dates of the cases, which the
Society thus thought deserving of its ‘'honorary certificate.’</p>
          <p>“Mr. Forten, while I was in the city, gave a strong proof of
his disregard for self-interest, in a case where the happiness of
his fellow-man was concerned. He refused a commission to
supply a ship in the harbour with sails, because it had been
employed in the slave trade, and was likely to be engaged again
in the same abominable traffic. He is now a wealthy man; and
has given his family, consisting of eight children, an excellent
education, adapted to the fortunes they will one day have, and
(I hope I may had) to the station they will one day fill;—for
the time cannot be far distant when virtues and
accomplishments, that would be respected in every other part
of the world, will raise their possessors in America above the
insults and vexations of the Pariah state.”</p>
          <p>Let me now introduce a female Howard of the despised race
as described by the same intelligent traveller. “I called at the
house of a coloured woman,' says Abdy, “who had been
mentioned to me as a remarkable instance of generosity and
benevolence. Her name was Hester Lane, and her age
<pb id="adams144" n="144"/>
between fifty and sixty. She received me without affectation
or reserve. The object of my visit was soon explained, and
the request I made as readily complied with. She informed me 
that she had redeemed eleven human beings from Slavery, in
Maryland, having purchased them at different times with the
savings she had made out of her hard earnings. She had never
had twenty dollars given to her, nor benefitted by inheritance
or bequest to the amount of a dollar. The house she lived in
was her own; and the room in which we sat was well furnished.
The first slave redeemed by her was a girl of eleven years of age:
the price was a hundred dollars. She had been present when she was
born, and afterwards assisted at her marriage, at the birth
of her four children, and ultimately at her death and her
funeral. The next she liberated was a boy of fourteen, for
two hundred dollars. The third, a man about thirty, for
two hundred and eighty dollars. The fourth case was that
of a man, his wife, and one child; as the parents were sickly
and no longer young, she was charged but one hundred and
forty dollars for the family; the former she had in a great
measure to maintain. The fifth case occurred about eight
years previously, and was that of a woman and three children; for these
she had to pay five hundred and fifty dollars; they were bought
at a public auction in Maryland, whither she went for the purpose,
having received several letters on the subject She afterwards
purchased the husband for two hundred dollars, and with great
difficulty and trouble, as the owner insisted upon having
three hundred dollars. She had the children properly educated
and instructed to gain their own livelihood: the greater part of
the purchase money was refunded by the objects of her bounty,
when they were able to repay her. This account, which I had
from her own lips, was confirmed by Mr. Curtis; most of the
cases he himself knew to be as I had heard them; for the rest,
he said, he would without hesitation vouch, as her word was
as good as any other person's oath. When I was with her,
she was teaching herself French; she was a woman of strong
religious feelings and principles. By her own exertions
she had obtained a comfortable competency for herself;
having been successful in discovering a new mode of colouring
walls, by which, and the assistance of a shop, she had realized
sufficient to provide for her own wants, and those ,of her less
fortunate fellow-creatures.</p>
          <p>”Like all of her race with whom I had any communication,
he was deeply affected by the numerous humiliations to
<pb id="adams145" n="145"/>
which she was exposed. She never for a moment doubted,
she said, that the designs of Providence were wise and
good, yet it was mysterious and afflicting to think that all
their nations and tribes should so long have been doomed
to unmitigated and unmerited bondage; and when free,
should still be subject to contempt and reproach. Her windows 
looked into the street, and it was most painful to her to witness
the savage way in which the blacks were treated by the people,
and by none worse than by the Irish, some of whom., not long
before, would have murdered a man of colour, if some persons
who were passing in a carriage at the time, had not assisted
him to escape.”</p>
          <p>“Among the many persons of colour whom I visited at
Philadelphia,” continues the same writer, “was Christiana
Gibbons, a woman of singular intelligence and good breeding. A
friend was with me; she received us with the courtesy and easy
manners of a gentle-woman. She appeared to be between
thirty and forty years of age, of pure African descent, with a expressive
countenance, and a graceful person. Her mother, who had been
stolen from her native land at an early age, was the daughter of
a king, and is now in her eighty-fifth year, the parent-stem of
no less than one hundred and eighty-two living branches. When
taken by the slavers, she had with her a piece of gold as an
ornament to denote her rank. Of this she was of course
deprived; and a solid bar of the same metal, which her parent sent
over to America for the purchase of her freedom, shared the
same fate.</p>
          <p>Christiana Gibbons, who is thus the granddaughter of
a prince of the Eboe tribe, was bought, when about fifteen
years of age, by a woman who was struck by her interesting
appearance, and emancipated her. Her benefactress left her
at her death, a legacy of eight thousand dollars. The whole
of this money was lost by the failure of a bank, but she
had other property acquired by her own industry, affording
a rent of five hundred dollars a year, Her agent, however,
Colonel Myers, though indebted to her for many attentions
and marks of kindness during sickness, had neglected to
remit her the money from Savannah, in Georgia, where the
estate  was situated; and when I saw her, she was living
with her husband and son on the fruits of her labour. The
former was owner of a wharf in Savannah, worth eight or
ten thousand dollars.</p>
          <p>“She had not been long resident in Philadelphia, whither she
had come to escape to numerous impositions and annoyances
<pb id="adams146" n="146"/>
to which she was exposed in Georgia. Mr. Kingsley
had long been acquainted with her, and spoke of her to me in the
highest terms. We found her indeed a very remarkable woman,
though it is probable there are many remarkable woman
among the despised slaves as amiable and accomplished as
herself. Such, at least, was the account she gave us of their
condition, that we felt convinced of the superiority possessed
by many in moral worth and intellectual acuteness above their
oppressors. She confirmed everything I had heard from others
with regard to the characters of the slaves. She never knew one
who did not long for freedom, or who felt contented with his
lot. Many have taught themselves reading and writing, having
acquired the requisite knowledge with astonishing rapidity. All
are alive to the injustice done them; some will rather suffer death
than be separated from the objects of their affection. Their
firmness is so well known, that a resolution to this effect when
once pronounced, will deter any one at a sale from purchasing
them separately.</p>
          <p>“Christiana had not forgotten that she had royal blood in her
veins, and she shewed herself worthy of the distinction it
implied, by her willingness to engage in any work that did not
carry moral degradation with it. If I might judge from the tenor of
her conversation, her hand and heart were never at fault, when
danger or distress called for the exertion of either. She had a
strong sense of religion, and the violation of its injunctions she
had been so long doomed to witness in others, had taught her the
necessity and value of practical attention to its duties. Her
brother, who had come to Philadelphia under a promise to return
to his owner, had informed her of his intention to obtain his
freedom by breaking his engagement. 'If he does so,'
said she 'he shall never enter my house again; whatever may be
his wrongs, his honour ought not to be forfeited.'
This feeling is so general and so well understood, that masters
often allow their slaves to go into other states upon their
promising not to abscond.”</p>
          <p>Some beautiful instances of the power of Divine grace,
working upon the heart of the native Negro, are related by Miss
Tucker, in her interesting volume, very appropriately entitled
“Sunrise within the Tropics.” Truly the light of the gospel has
now broken forth on a continent long under darkness and
eclipse. Amongst the most interesting of these cases, I condense
the following:—</p>
          <p>Adjai, a boy of twelve years old, along with his mother
<pb id="adams147" n="147"/>
and sisters, was bound in , chains, and sold into slavery. After
suffering very greatly, being several times sold and resold,
dragged from place to place, and enduring almost intolerable
hardships and sorrows, Adjai was shipped, in 1822, with one
hundred and eighty-seven unfortunate companions, on board a
Portuguese slaver at Lagos, where the treatment he met with
corresponded but too well with the frightful accounts detailed
in the Parliamentary Papers. Happily it was but of short
duration; for, on the very next evening, by God's good
providence, the slaver fell in with two English cruisers, and was
captured by them. The poor captives were now in greater despair
than before, for the Portuguese had succeeded in making these
simple-hearted people believe that the English thus watched for
and seized the Slave ships, that they might use the blood of the
Negroes to dye their scarlet cloth, and their flesh as baits for
cowries.</p>
          <p>Adjai and a few other boys were taken on board one of the
English ships. But here their terror was wound up
to its highest pitch, by seeing a number of cannon-balls piled
upon the deck, which they took for the heads of some of their
companions; while they concluded that some joints of pork
hanging up to dry were their limbs. They were soon,
however, re-assured; and when I inform my, readers that
the ship on which our young friend was now taken, was the
Myrmidon, and the Commander was Captain Leeke, they will
have no difficulty in recognizing the heathen Adjai under the
Christian name of Samuel Crowther!</p>
          <p>We cannot now follow Adjai in the events of the next few
years, except to say, that on his arrival at Sierra Leone, he was
placed under the care of an European Catechist, and his wife,
who shewed him every kindness. He grew in grace as he
advanced in years, was baptized, and became first a student,
then an instructor in the Fourah Bay Institution for the
education of young men as teachers and catechists. In 1844, he
stood forth an ordained minister, to proclaim the gospel of
salvation in their own tongue to hundreds around him, rescued,
like himself, from the slavery of body and soul; and to invite
them to enter into the glorious liberty of the sons of God.</p>
          <p>Having established a school for boys, and one for girls, and
translated several portions of the Bible into the Fourahan
language, the “Rev.” Samuel Crowther visited England in 1851,
for the purpose of inspecting the printing of them. The
“interpretation of tongues” has been one of his most
<pb id="adams148" n="148"/>
important occupations. Besides a Yoraban primer, he translated
the Gospel of Luke, the Acts of the Apostles, the Epistle to the
Romans, and Watts' First Catechism.</p>
          <p>Abdy mentions having had put into his hands a letter
written by a young man, who had been brought, when a
child, from the coast of Africa. By working extra time,
and reducing his hours for sleep almost to the minimum
required for existence, he succeeded in teaching himself to
read and write, and in purchasing his freedom. For the
latter he paid seven hundred dollars, including what he had
given for certain portions of time to work on his own
account. His name was James Bradley, aged about twenty-
seven years; his skin was a very deep jet black. The paper
alluded to was addressed to Lydia M. Child, of Boston, and
contained a narrative of his sufferings and his exertions. As
he was but two or three years of age, when he was stolen
from Africa, he could remember nothing that occurred to
him in that country, except that he was at play in the fields
when he was carried off. The cruelties he had witnessed in
South Carolina, whither he was taken, could not, he said, be
described. His master bore the character of a kind and humane
man towards his slaves; yet he was accustomed to knock poor
Bradley about the head so cruelly, that his life was despaired of,
and the whole family were equally brutal, for while the children
were tormenting him with sticks and pins, the father expressed
a wish, in his presence, that he was dead, as he would never
be good for anything, telling him that “he would as soon knock
him on the head as an opossom.”</p>
          <p>In his letter to Mrs. Child, Bradley assures her that what is
said by travellers, and others who have questioned the slaves
upon their wish for freedom, is not to be relied on; as it is
a matter of policy with them to affect contentment, and
conceal their real sentiments on the subject, since harsher treatment,
and severe measures to prevent escape, would be the inevitable
result of any anxiety they might show for liberty. “How strange it
is”—such are Bradley's own words—“that anybody should believe
that a human being could be a slave, and feel contented. I don't believe
there ever was a slave who did not long for liberty.”</p>
          <p>The whole of Bradley's letter, which has been published in Mrs.
Child's “Oasis,” bears the stamp of a mind elevated, candid, and,
simple, to a degree that art would attempt in vain to imitate.
Abdy mentions reading another letter from a man in Ladiona,
who had in a similar manner obtained
<pb id="adams149" n="149"/>
both his freedom and a knowledge of writing. “His sentiments
and style were of a very superior order. There were not not more,
in a long composition, than two or three trivial errors of grammar—
one of them so purely idiomatic that I have often observed it in men
who profess to be well educated. The hand-writing was singularly
clear, and even beautiful.”</p>
          <p>Speaking of the youths in a coloured school, E. S. Abdy
says of one of the boys, “He had one of the finest heads
and most intelligent countenances to be seen on human
shoulders. The complexion was African, but the features
were European. He was the brother of a boy whom I
had examined—with others of the same race—some months
before, in Latin; on which occasion they all acquitted
themselves beyond what the shortness of the time they
had been engaged in the study of the language, could have
warranted any one to expect. Some essays, which they had
composed in English, were read by them at the same time.
A few of them were particularly well written; and, all of them
as deserving of praise as any compositions by persons of the
same age.”</p>
          <p>When at Cincinatti, Abdy spent an evening in visiting some of
the coloured people. “I found their houses,” he observes,
“furnished in a style of comfort and elegance much superior to what I
had seen among whites of the same rank At one of them was an old
man, Solomon Scott, of a very advanced age. From his own statement,
which was confirmed by those present, be must have been one hundred
and fourteen years old. He had retained his faculties, and was
strong enough to walk without assistance, though his feet were
much crippled by the sufferings he had undergone; having been
compelled, for six years, to drag a weight of fifty-six pounds,
attached by a chain to his legs, while at work. In addition to this instrument of
wearisome annoyance, he had worn an iron collar round his
neck, fastened to his waist, and projecting over his head, with a
bell suspended from the upper part. He was a very religious man;
and it was for preaching to his fellow-slaves, that these excruciating
tortures were inflicted upon him. When we asked him if he had ever
been flogged, he threw his arms up wildly, and seemed to labour under an
oppressive load of recollections. This was invariably his
custom, when the subject was recalled to his mind—‘Yes!’ he
exclaimed, ‘the cowhide was my breakfast, and dinner, and
supper,’ meaning that he had been exposed to the lash
<pb id="adams150" n="150"/>
at every meal. When he had completed a century of suffering
and sorrow, he resolutely declared that his task was done, and
he would work no more. His master then brought him from
Virginia to Ohio, and left him on the banks of the river.</p>
          <p>In spite of his years and his infirmities, poor Solomon
managed to find his way to the Cincinatti hotel; where he was
earning his bread like an honest man, by cleaning shoes, and
making himself useful about the house; when his owner, finding
he had still a few dollars worth of labour left in him, sent his
brother-in-law to bring him back. Outraged humanity, however,
at last asserted her rights—the indignation of the by-standers
protected the old man's grey hairs. He was subsequently
rescued by the benevolence of one of his own race, who
provided him a comfortable home in his declining years. His
benefactor, who had realized five or six thousand dollars by his
industry, to which he was indebted for his own freedom industry,
had laid out part of his savings in procuring that blessing for others.
He had redeemed a young woman from servitude for three hundred, and
a man for six hundred, dollars.</p>
          <p>“As the poor old man expressed himself very indistinctly
the mistress of the house interpreted what he said. An anecdote
she had frequently heard from him, and which she
related to us, while he sat by enjoying the general laugh it
created, shewed what cunning and self-possession the slaves
have. She had before told us a very amusing story of a lad who
acted the part of Brutus so successfully, that, while his master
set him down for an idiot, he had completed his preparations
for a long journey and started 'one fine day' with his saddle-bags
well filled and a trusty steed, for Canada; with the route to which he
had made himself thoroughly acquainted, by asking one of
the sons to explain the queer dots and lines on the map.
He changed horses regularly as he proceeded, wherever he
could do so with safety, and dismissed them in succession,
to find their way home. In this manner he arrived at the
place ‘where he would be,’ and is now a good loyal British
subject; while his master is vowing vengeance, and literally
growing twigs to scourge rebellious boy—when he gets
him again into his power; his forgiveness of a former flight,
occasioned by his brutality, having, he declares, encouraged
a second attempt.”</p>
          <p>But we must not forget ‘Uncle Solomon’ and his joke. “He
was one Sunday at a neighbour's house, when the
<pb id="adams151" n="151"/>
mistress returned from church, and not finding the dinner ready
began to scold the cook in no measured terms. ‘Madam,’'
said the woman, ‘you gave me no orders; and you know you
have always told me to do nothing without orders.’ ‘True,’
replied the mistress, ‘but your conscience might have told you
that I was not to be starved.’ The cook put on a look of
stupidity. ‘What! don't you understand me?’ exclaimed the
virago, ‘don't you understand what conscience is? Solomon!
you know what conscience is?’ Solomon kept his wisdom to himself.
‘Why Solomon! you must be a fool; conscience is something within us that
tells when we do wrong.’ ‘Where was yours then,’ said
Solomon, ‘when you cut that poor woman's back to pieces
the other day?’ Before she could recover from her confusion
Solomon had vanished; having very prudently followed the
example of those wits who make it a point to quit the
company when they have said ‘a good thing.’</p>
          <p>The “Rev.” Peter Williams was the minister of the “African”
Protestant Episcopal Church, in New York, into which he was
ordained by Bishop Hobart, and in spite of his lineage was
much respected. His father performed, while a slave, an action
so noble and disinterested that it ought to be recorded. During
the revolutionary war, he rescued a Presbyterian minister of
New Jersey from the enemy, who were in search of him as one
of the most active promoters of the rebellion. An English
officer, who suspected that William knew the place of the
minister's retreat, threatened his life, and then offered him
his purse, to betray him. But neither the menace nor the gold
any influence on his resolution; he resisted both, to preserve
a man who had no claim upon his benevolence but the danger
he was in.</p>
          <p>When Williams was emancipated he kept a tobacconist's
shop, and it is remarkable that he had as his first servant the
son of his former master—a double reverse of <sic corr="fortune">ortune</sic> that
illustrates the doctrine of compensation in a very striking
manner.</p>
          <p>The “Rev.” Peter Williams was a very intelligent man, of
pleasing and gentlemanly manners. White clergymen and even
bishops were sometimes seen in his pulpit. Abdy visited him,
and says, “I was much gratified with the information he gave
me relative to the prospects of a people who, like the Jews,
have escaped from bondage to suffer from calumny.” Having
attended the Africo-American Church, Abdy continues:—“The
service was read by a white clergyman, and the sermon
delivered by my excellent friend
<pb id="adams152" n="152"/>
Mr. Williams. The subject of the discourse was the death of
Wilberforce. After a brief narrative of the philanthropist's early
career, the preacher touched upon the difficulties which
surrounded him in the pursuit of that humane object, to which
he had devoted his life:—the prejudices of early education, the
indifference of friends, the allurements of fortune, the world's
hostility and worn. He surmounted all; and found, in the
triumph which ultimately crowned his exertions, the reward of
his labours, and a reputation which has identified his name with
all that is celebrated in eloquence, and beloved in humanity. ‘To
him’ exclaimed the preacher, ‘our gratitude will be for ever due. To
his indefatigable zeal in our cause we owe the redress of our
wrongs; to his example shall we be indebted for the recovery of
our rights; when the prejudice which now separates us from our
fellow-countrymen shall yield to juster notions of religious
duty, and social obligations. Let all who are now suffering under
unmerited opprobrium, or the lash of the taskmaster, be patient,
for the day of redemption draweth nigh. The chains of the slave
have been broken by that nation which first abolished the cruel
traffic that had torn him from his native land; and this example
of a generous policy will not be lost upon our country.’ The
congregation was exhorted by every consideration which respect
for their benefactors and friends, a deep sense of duty towards
their Heavenly Father and themselves, and the laudable wish to
throw off the stigma of undeserved humiliation, can inspire; to
cultivate their minds and dispositions, and to think no effort too great,
no sacrifice too dear by which they might be enabled to vindicate their
claim to equal acceptance and estimation with their white
brethren; and to devote themselves to the highest level of
attainments which honest industry can reach, and virtuous
motives suggest, The sermon concluded with an application to
the consciences of all present, of those great and momentous
truths which were so strongly exemplified by their influence
upon his opinions and conduct, in the venerable subject of his
eulogy.</p>
          <p>“This is but the substance of what he said. I cannot do
justice to the simplicity of the language, and propriety of
illustration which characterized the composition. I was
with an English friend, and we both remarked that all
who were present were particularly attentive to their 
devotions, and respectable in their appearance. I can truly
say that I never saw the church service better performed; more
<pb id="adams153" n="153"/>
devotion and regularity in the responses, or a purer spirit
of christian charity and concord. And these are the people
who are described by the Colonization Society as the vilest
and basest of mankind. At one of the public meetings, with 
which these hypocritical conspirators against human freedom
are striving to delude the country, the Chancellor of the
State, (Walworth,) asserted that the free blacks were ‘a
wretched and degraded race, with nothing of freedom but
the name;’ thus committing the very offence which had
been imputed with so much bitterness, during the evening,
to Garrison—calumniating his own countrymen.”</p>
          <p>Much more might be said of the “Rev.” Peter Williams.
There is a beautiful native eloquence in a sermon of his I have,
delivered on the death of the coloured Captain Paul Cuffe. Let
me conclude this brief notice with the following appeal which
he makes on behalf of his race—“We are <hi rend="italics">natives</hi> of this country,
(America;) we ask only to be treated as well as <hi rend="italics">foreigners</hi>. Not
a few of our fathers suffered and bled to purchase its
independence; we ask only to be treated as well as those who
fought against it. We have toiled to cultivate it, and to raise it to
its present prosperous condition: we ask only to share equal
privileges with those who come from distant lands to enjoy the
fruits of our labour.”</p>
          <p>Joseph J. Gurney speaks of a Negro he met with in Edinbro'.
“John Padmore,” says he “now aged sixty, was once in slavery
in Barbadoes. By dint of good conduct and industry, he saved
£200, with which he purchased his freedom: he has since paid
the like sum for the manumission of his aged father; and again
for that of his son. He underwent dreadful sufferings from the
cruelty of his master and mistress, when a slave; but they are
now ruined and Padmore has generously ministered to their necessitie
He obtained a considerable property by trading at New Orleans,
and other parts of the United States. He is neat, cheerful, sensible,
and pious; and, with his wife, is living at Edinbro', respected by
his neighbours, and in great, comfort. His whole appearance and
demeanour,” adds J. J. Gurney, “are calculated to shew the folly
and iniquity of what one of the French deputies has lately called
the aristocracy of the skin.”</p>
          <p>Zilpha Elaw, a coloured female, about fifty years of age, has
travelled through America, as a kind of evangelist, preaching
among various sects of Christians. She is a Wesleyan minister,
and in 1840 visited England<sic corr="no comma">,</sic> with the
<pb id="adams154" n="154"/>
highest credentials. Her dress was similar to that of the Society
of Friends. A Wesleyan preacher in Kent says “She spent
twelve weeks with me in my circuit, and God owned her word
as He had done in her father's land. I have no doubt her visit
will be made a blessing to the British churches—God grant it,
Amen. She has a musical voice, good talents as a public
speaker, and, as far as mortals can see, her piety is genuine. She
seems to have a deep-toned pity for mankind, a burning charity
for blood-bought souls; she goes with
<q direct="unspecified"><lg><l>‘Cries, entreaties, tears, to save—</l><l>To snatch them from the gaping grave.’ ”</l></lg></q></p>
          <p>Having seen this coloured female when she was in England,
and heard her publicly preach, I can testify to the truthfulness
of the above statement.</p>
          <p>The author of <hi rend="italics">A Tour in the United States</hi>, whom I have so
often had the pleasure of quoting, says he was once asked
with a sarcastic smile, by an American lady of Hibernian
descent, whether he had met with any interesting Negroes in
the course of his tour. “The winter I passed in New York,”
says he, “furnished what this woman, (with all her contempt
for a race more persecuted and less fortunate than that from
which she herself sprang,) would acknowledge to be most
painfully interesting. During the frost, some ice, on which
several boys were skating, in the outskirts of the city, gave way;
and several of them were drowned. In the confusion and terror
occasioned by this accident, a coloured boy, named Peterson, whose
courage and hardihood were well known, was called upon to render assistance.
He immediately threw himself into the water with his skates
on, and succeeded in saving two lads; but while exerting
himself to rescue a third, he was drawn under the ice,
and unable to extricate himself. None would risk his life
<hi rend="italics">for him!</hi> Soon after, the details of this melancholy event
appeared in one of the newspapers, with an offer to receive
subscriptions for the mother, Susannah Peterson, who was
left with a sick husband and a young family deprived of
the support which she had derived from her son's industry.
The subscription raised did not amount to seventy dollars.
When we consider that the population of the place amounted
to more than two hundred and fifty thousand, including
Brooklyn, it is little to its credit that the gratitude it felt
for the preservation of two of its citizens, could find no
<pb id="adams155" n="155"/>
better way to exhibit itself than by a paltry donation to the self-
devoted preserver's afflicted parent of a sum scarcely exceeding
one fourth of what he might have been sold for when living, in
the slave-market at New Orleans.</p>
          <p>“As reference was made to a medical man in Park Place, I
called upon him, and received a very favourable account both
of the boy and his poor mother. I immediately proceeded to
her house, and found that she had three children left:—the
eldest about ten years of age, and the youngest an infant at the
breast. In addition to these, she had undertaken the care of a
little girl, five years old, the daughter of a deceased friend,
whose husband had deserted his child, and refused to pay
anything towards her support. ‘I consider her as my child,’ said
the generous woman, ‘and while I have a crust left, she shall
share it with my children.” I made inquiries about the boy she
had just lost, and was told what I had heard in Park Place—that
his conduct had always been most exemplary; that he had
carried his mother every cent he could save from his earnings,
and had often expressed a wish that he might obtain sufficient
to keep her from working so hard; her business sometimes keeping her
up nearly all night.”</p>
          <p>“Such,” continues the narrator, “was the history of
Susannah Peterson and her heroic boy. It was told in the
most simple and natural style, without any display of grief,
or the slightest attempt to exhibit feeling, or excite
commiseration There was an expression of dejection, however,
in the countenance that could not be mistaken; and an effort to
suppress the workings of a mother's heart that I never saw so
striking in any one. Everything in the furniture of the room,
the decent behaviour of the children, and the general
deportment of the parent, bespoke full as much propriety and
respectability as I ever met with in the same class of life,
whatever might be the occupation or complexion, I had
frequent opportunities of seeing Mrs. Peterson, and my
respect for her character increased with my acquaintance.”</p>
          <p>Although this woman was dependent on her daily labours
for a livelihood, she was a member and contributor to
benevolent societies in New York. Her brother, who is known
in England as the African Roscius, occasionally sent her
remittances of money, and had expressed in one of his letters
from this country, an intention to provide for her unfortunate
boy's education. I am myself acquainted with the African
Roscius, as he is called, more properly
<pb id="adams156" n="156"/>
Ira<ref id="ref16" n="16" rend="sc" target="note16" targOrder="U">*</ref> 
Aldridge, whose abilities as a tragic and comic actor
are unquestionable, and deserve some notice here. It may
be interesting, however, first to refer to his progenitors.</p>
          <p>His forefathers were princes of the Foulah tribe, whose
dominions were, in Senegal, on the banks of the river of that
name on the west coast of Africa. To this shore one of our early
missionaries found his way, and took charge of Ira's father,
Daniel Aldridge, in order to qualify him for the work of
civilizing and evangelizing his countrymen. Daniel's
father, the reigning prince, was more enlightened than his
subjects, probably through the instruction of the missionary,
and proposed that his prisoners taken in battle should be
exchanged, and not, as was the custom, sold as slaves.
This wish interfered with the notions and perquisites of his
tribe, especially his principal chiefs: and a civil war raged among
the people. During these differences, Daniel, then a
promising youth, was taken to America by the missionary and
sent to Schenectady College, near New York, to receive the
advantages of a Christian education. Three days after his
departure the revolutionary storm which was brewing, broke
out openly, and the reigning prince, the advocate of humanity,
was killed.</p>
          <p>Daniel Aldridge remained in America till the death of the
rebellious chief, who had headed the conspiracy, and reigned
instead of the murdered prince. During the interval Daniel had
become a minister of the Gospel, and was regarded by all
classes as a man of uncommon abilities. He was, however,
desirous to establish himself at the head of his tribe, possess
himself of his birth-right, and advance the cause of Christianity
among his countrymen. For this purpose, he returned to his native
country, taking with him a young wife, one of his own colour, whom
he had but just married in America. To this step he was prompted the
by advice of his white friends, who, doubtless looked forward to his
reign as one calculated to encourage the growth of those “Gospel seeds”
which had been planted among the children of the Foulah tribe. Their
pious hopes and intentions were frustrated. Daniel no sooner appeared
among the people of his slaughtered father, than old
disagreements revived, civil war broke out, the enlightened
African was defeated, barely escaping from the scene of
<note id="note16" n="16" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref16">*  PUNCH, seeing a joke, and availing himself of it, said lately:—
“ ‘<foreign lang="fre">Ira est furor brevis. </foreign>’ The theatrical critics are loud in praise of a real
Ethiopian tragredian, Mr. Aldridge,  with the unusual christian name of Ira,
which is no doubt symbolical of its owner being ‘the rage’ wherever he goes.”</note>
<pb id="adams157" n="157"/>
strife with his life, and for some time unable to quit the
country, which was watched by numerous enemies, anxious
for his capture. Nine years elapsed before the proscribed family
escaped to America, during the whole of which time they were
concealed in the neighbourhood of their foes, enduring vicissitudes
and hardships that can well be imagined not be described.</p>
          <p>On their arrival in America, Daniel returned to his ministerial
duties, influencing aright the minds of people of his own
complexion in that country instead of his own. He did not live
in vain, as the following extract from the obituary of an
American paper at the time of his decease in 1840, may
testify:—“There are few individuals who have been more
generally useful than the Rev. Mr. Aldridge, and whose loss
will be more severely felt in New York, among his coloured
brethren, to whom he was endeared by his faithful discharge
of the duties incumbent on him as a Christian minister.”</p>
          <p>Ira Aldridge was born soon after his father's arrival in
Senegal, and on their return to America, was intended by the
latter for the church. Many a white parent has ‘chalked out’ in
vain for his son a similar calling, and the best intentions have
been thwarted by an early predilection quite in an opposite
direction. We can well account for the father's choice in this
instance, as in keeping with his own aspirations; and we can
easily imagine his disappointment upon abandoning all hope of
seeing one of his blood and colour following specially in the
service of his great Master. The son, however, began betimes
to shew his early preference and ultimate passion. At school
he was awarded prizes for declamation, in which he excelled;
and there his curiosity was excited by what he heard of
theatrical representations, which he was told <hi rend="italics">embodied</hi> all the
fine ideas <hi rend="italics">shadowed forth</hi> in the language he read and committed
to memory. It became the wish of his heart to witness one of
these performances, and that wish he soon contrived to
gratify, and finally he became a candidate for histrionic
fame.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the progress Ira had made in learning, no
qualities of the mind could compensate in the eyes of the
Americans, for the dark hue of his skin. The prevailing
prejudice, so strong among all classes, was against him. This
induced his removal to England, where he entered at the
Glasgow University, and, under Professor Sandford, obtained
several premiums, and the medal for Latin composition.
<pb id="adams158" n="158"/>
Space does not admit of our following his career. His
early preference “grew with his growth and strengthened with
his strength,” and despite his one personal disadvantage, he
has obtained a reputation which stamps his abilities as a tragic
and comic actor beyond dispute. He is allowed to possess
every mental and physical requisite for those
parts he performs. He has a clear and flexible voice, which he
uses with great judgment and taste; he can infuse great expression
and feeling into his intonation; his emphasis is judicious, and his
transitions natural and appropriate. Sheridan Knowles complimented
and encouraged him; and Edmund Kean, in a letter of recommendation,
says, “I have witnessed his performances with pleasure: he possesses
wonderful versatility.” Madame Malibran, in speaking of his 
<sic corr="portrayal">personation</sic> of Othello, said she “never witnessed, in the course
of her professional career in both hemispheres, a more
interesting and powerful performance, marked throughout by
that strict adherence to nature which should be the characteristic of
every dramatic portraiture.”</p>
          <p>I could adduce a volume of favourable comments upon
the performances of this “African Kean,” as he has been
called. One short one from the <hi rend="italics">London Weekly Times</hi>,
must suffice:—“Mr. Ira Aldridge is an African of Mulatto
tint, with woolly hair. His features are capable of much
expression , his action is unrestrained and picturesque and
his voice clear, full, and resonant. His powers of energetic
declamation are very marked, and the whole of his acting
appears impulsed by a current of feeling of no inconsiderable
weight and vigour, yet controlled and guided in a manner
that clearly shews the actor to be a person of much study
and great stage experience.”</p>
          <p>Be it understood, I have not a word to say in favour or
defence of stage entertainments, and I give them no
encouragement; but to speak honestly, I have myself witnessed
the performance of this specimen of a ‘distinct’ and ‘marked
race,’ that I might be able to add him to the long catalogue of
witnesses, as a living refutation of the assertions so frequently
made as to their imbecility; and to assist in disarming the weapons
with which those unfortunates are so often assailed, who wear
“The shadowed livery of the burnish'd Sun;”
whose very virtues are turned against them in the shape of
distorted and exaggerated facts, and against whose sable
<pb id="adams159" n="159"/>
fraternity it has become almost a fashion to indulge in
lampoons, and to exult in caricatures of their peculiarities.</p>
          <p>It is from the <hi rend="italics">various characteristics</hi> exhibited under <hi rend="italics">different
aspects</hi> by the Negro race, that our conclusions must be drawn
as to their capability and <hi rend="italics">identity</hi> with the more favoured
portion of mankind. The acquirements of a scholar, the
conception of a poet, and the accomplishments of a gentleman,
must be united in the individual that can signalize himself by
earning a reputation in the highest walks of the drama, equal to
that which the African Roscius has attained. And it is impossible
to regard a man of colour, possessing a <hi rend="italics">soul capable of appreciating</hi>,
<hi rend="italics">endowments equal to the representation</hi> of the immortal Shakspere's
great creations, and not sigh in serious contemplation over
the wrongs of thousands of his race, treated by their paler
brethren as mindless, heartless, soulless, feelingless clay;
bearing the corporeal impress of humanity, but cruelly, or
thoughtlessly denied its spiritual attributes! A moral lesson
<hi rend="italics">will</hi> present and even intrude itself with the simple facts, that
as ebony may be polished, and coals emit sparks, so the swarthy
race of Africa are as capable of cultivation as the fairest son of Albion.</p>
          <p>There is a coloured female now in England, Eliza T.
Greenfield, known as the “Black Swan,” who has arrested
considerable interest as a vocalist. She was poor, and had to
live at service when young, but she had an eye, an ear,
and soul for music, and being determined to make some
progress in it, she hit upon this expedient. She would
take a class of young persons to teach , and thus ground herself
in the rudiments, and obtain additional money over and above
what would purchase for herself further instruction. She
proceeded with such success that though she commenced at the
age of twenty, when she sang at Stafford House in the presence
of some of the principal nobility, she astonished all who heard her.
She has sung before the most brilliant circles, and in every instance
has been admired. “I never heard a man,” says Ward , “who could sing
lower bass; and the compass of her voice extends from the highest to the
lowest pitch. Sir David Brewster, after hearing her, turned to me and
said ‘She has two distinct voices.’ ”</p>
          <p>The Pernambucana, one of the vessels of the Brazilian
Steam Packet Company, was wrecked near Saint Katherine's,
towards the close of 1853, and upwards of forty of her
passengers were drowned. This disaster afforded an opportunity
<pb id="adams160" n="160"/>
for a display of heroism and bravery rarely equalled.
A black sailor, belonging to the vessel, succeeded with
many others in reaching the shore; numbers had perished
in the attempt, and but few of the passengers remained
upon the wreck. All of these, including a mother and six
children, did Simao save. Twelve times had this noble
fellow swam through the furious breakers on the coast, and
each time returned bringing a victim from destruction; then
wearied, as he well might be, from his almost superhuman
efforts, he threw himself exhausted upon the sands, when a cry
was raised that one human being still remained upon the wreck.
No one was hardy enough to attempt the rescue of the poor
passenger, a blind man, whose piteous cries for succour were
faintly heard on shore. But the brave Simao again dived into the
furious surf, reached the vessel, and brought the poor blind man
safely to land, thus saving, by his noble and unaided exertions,
no less than thirteen lives. The shipwrecked passengers, together
with the saviour of so large a number of them, arrived in the
Guapiassu steamer, and it is pleasing to add that the Brazilians were
by no means slow in marking their appreciation of, and rewarding
this heroic action. A subscription was opened in the <foreign lang="por">Praca do
Commercio</foreign>, and the amount subscribed in two days exceeded seven
contos of reis, or about £800. The Emperor and Empress, whose hands
are always open for the succour of the needy, or reward of the
meritorious, contributed nine hundred milreis, and the
subscription soon amounted to£1,000. In addition to this a
statue of the black is to be placed in the Exchange.</p>
          <p>Some of the military services of coloured men are related
in the early part of this letter. Contrasted with the “pomp
and circumstance of war,” let us now glance at some of the
services of this people rendered voluntarily during a visitation 
of pestilence, as related by Wm. C. Nell.</p>
          <p>In the autumn of <sic corr="1793">1973</sic>, the yellow fever broke out in
Philadelphia with a peculiar malignity. The insolent and
unnatural distinctions of caste were overturned, and the
coloured people were solicited in the public papers to come
forward and assist the perishing sick. The same mouth which
had glorified against them in its prosperity, in its overwhelming
adversity now implored their assistance. The coloured people
of Philadelphia nobly responded. The then mayor, Matthew
Clarkson, received their deputation with respect, and
recommended their course. They appointed Absalom Jones
and William Gray to superintend it, the
<pb id="adams161" n="161"/>
mayor advertising the public that, by applying to them, aid could
be obtained.</p>
          <p>Soon afterwards the sickness increased so dreadfully, that it
became next to impossible to remove the corpses. The
coloured people<hi rend="italics"> volunteered</hi> this painful and dangerous duty,
did it extensively, and hired help in doing it. Dr. Rush
instructed the two superintendents in the proper precautions
and measures to be used.</p>
          <p>A sick white man crept to his chamber window, and
entreated the passers by to bring him a drink of water. Several white
men passed, but hurried on. A foreigner came up—paused—was
afraid to supply the help with his own hands, but stood and
offered eight dollars to whomsoever would. At length a poor
black man appeared; he heard—stopped—ran for water—
took it to the sick man, and then stayed by him to nurse him,
steadily and mildly refusing all pecuniary compensation. Sarah
Boss, a poor black widow, was active in voluntary and benevolent
services. A poor black man, named Sampson, went constantly from house
to house giving assistance everywhere gratuitously, until he
was seized with the fever and died.</p>
          <p>There are at this moment well-educated coloured men in the
practice of the several liberal professions in different
parts of the United States. J. B. Vashon, at Pittsburg, and Robert
Morris, at Boston, are good lawyers; Dr. Mc'Cune Smith, of
New York, is an intelligent physician; and Dr. Pennington,
as stated in this volume, has graduated at Heidelburg. Charles
Reason, is a professor, a writer, and a poet; and William G.
Allen now in England, is also a professor, and an author. As an
editor and an orator, Frederick Douglass is pre-eminent; and
William H. Day stands on a par with the entire editorial corps.
There are numerous coloured artists in the States. Says Ward,
“I knew a Negro, named Smith, an historical painter, a man of
loose habits, but of great talents; when sober he could earn any
amount of money, even in prejudiced America. Mr. Reason,
an engraver, is brother to Professor Reason. One of the best
Daugerrian artists in Hartford is Mr. Washington. In Ohio there
is Mr. Ball. In Philadelphia there is Mr. Brown, who has received
commendations where a black man is despised more than anywhere.”</p>
          <p>With regard to the coloured race in the West Indies, the Chief
Justice of Dominica, Glanville, is a Mulatto; and the Clerk to
the House of Assembly, who was recently in England, is still
darker; Sharp, the Attorney-General of
<pb id="adams162" n="162"/>
Barbadoes, is a Mulatto; Garroway, Judge of the Court of
Appeals, in Barbadoes, is a Mulatto; the Governor of Nevis is a
Mulatto; thirty-two editors of newspapers in the British West
Indian colonies, are Negroes and Mulattoes; in all the
Legislative Councils, and Houses of Representatives, there are
no less than seventy-two Mulattoes and two Negroes, making
laws for their former masters, the Whites. Two-thirds of the
army or garrison in those colonies is already composed of
African soldiers commanded by white officers. The church is
also abundantly supplied with black and mulatto clergymen;
the jurymen are almost entirely composed of Negroes and Mulattoes.</p>
          <p>To deny the Negroes equality in face of all these facts, is a
monstrous absurdity. Well may Frederick Douglass exclaim on
behalf of his maligned and outraged race, “Is it not astonishing,
that, while we are ploughing, planting, and reaping, using all kinds of
mechanical tools, erecting houses and constructing bridges, building
ships, working in metals of brass, iron, and copper, silver and gold; that
while we are reading, writing, and cyphering, acting as
clerks, merchants, and secretaries, having among us lawyers,
doctors, ministers, poets, authors, editors, orators, and
teachers; that while we are engaged in all manner of
enterprises common to other men, digging gold in California,
capturing the whale in the Pacific, breeding sheep
and cattle on the hill side, living, moving, acting, thinking,
planning, living in families as husbands, wives, and children,
and, above all, confessing and worshipping the christian's
God, and looking hopefully for life and immortality beyond the 
grave,—is it not astonishing, I say, that we are called upon to prove
that we are men?”</p>
          <p>It seems almost superfluous to assert that it is in the right
exercise of the faculties with which he is endowed, that man
can fulfil the objects for which he had a being; become a useful
member of the community, qualified to promote the happiness
of his fellow-man; and what is of the greatest importance to
himself—enabled to secure his own. Admitting, then, as we must
do, that Negroes are men, to remove them out of the state of
degradation to which they are subjected, and place them in a
capacity to assert the dignity of men in a social, civil, and
religious sense, must be the aspiration of every noble mind.</p>

          <p>1. It has been sometimes urged in defence of Slavery, that it is a most ancient
institution; that it has existed from the earliest period of man's history as a social
being; that in all the great nations of antiquity, and even under the mild and paternal
government of the Patriarchs, Slavery was recognised as lawful and right, or at all
events allowed as the most expedient form of servitude. It has been therefore argued
that men may be held in bondage, provided they be well treated and cared for; but
this is a monstrous error, and one which a slight examination of the scope and
tendency of the Gospel's principles and precepts must at once overthrow.
“Christianity,” says Dr. Channing, whose noble essay all such reasoners will do well
to peruse, —“Christianity is the manifestation and inculcation of Universal Love. The
great teaching of Christianity is that we must recognise and respect human nature in
all its forms, in the poorest, most ignorant, most fallen. * * * 
He who cannot see a brother, a child of God, a man possessing all the rights of
humanity under a skin darker than his own, wants the vision of a Christian.”</p>

          <p>2. The ancients distinguished all the interior portion of Africa from the
comparatively civilized countries lying along the coasts of the Mediterranean and
the Red Sea, by calling the latter Lybia, and the former Ethiopia, and it was, as now,
upon this portion of the great African continent that the curse of slavery fell most
heavily.</p>

          <p>3. It ought to stimulate our energies in behalf of the poor Negro, to reflect that
many of those from whom we are remotely descended, suffered the horrors of
captivity. “Yes,”as Mr. Chambers, in his excellent little tract on Slavery, observes,
“Eighteen centuries ago, when Britain was a distant colony of Rome, the
unfortunate inhabitants of our own dear island, torn from their homes, toiled for a
Roman master, along with the dark-skinned and more pliant native of Ethiopia.” It
will be remembered that it was the exposure of some British children for sale in the
slave market of the Imperial City, which first called the attention of St. Gregory to
this country, and led to the introduction of Christianity.—(See Hume.)</p>

          <p>4. His strength of frame, and power of enduring fatigue, united to a mild
and patient disposition, and great aptitude for acquiring any necessary art,
appear at all times to have rendered the Negro preferable for purposes of
labour and servitude. In 1503, when the Spanish colonists imported a few
Negroes into America as an experiment, it was found that one of these could
do as much work as four Indians, and thenceforth they were eagerly sought
for by the American planters, and others who required labourers inured to
the burning rays of a tropical sun. Then arose the modern system of Negro
Slavery, and commenced those horrors and atrocities of the Slave Trade, to
which Antiquity offers no parallel. Dr. Channing says, “We are holding in
bondage one of the best races of the human family. The Negro is among
the mildest and gentlest of men. * * * * * * *
His nature is affectionate and easily touched, and hence he is more open to religious
impressions than the white man. The European races have manifested more courage,
enterprise, and invention; but in the dispositions which Christianity particularly
honours, how inferior are they to the African.”</p>

Anti-Slavery Committee, will here recur to the mind and the affecting appeal, “Am I not
a man and a brother?” will, it is hoped, find a sympathising echo in the hearts of all

          <p>7. In enumerating a <hi rend="italics">few</hi> of the eminent philanthropists, who have devoted
their energies to the abolition of Slavery, we should not forget to name those
great statesmen, Fox and Pitt, and that persevering lawyer, Granville Sharp, owing to
whose efforts it was first established as a point of law that a Slave is free the moment
he puts foot on English ground; the names of these men, and of Buxton, Gurney, and
other workers in the good cause, will ever be associated with those of the two
apostles of freedom, Clarkson and Wilberforce. In perusing the lucid history of the
Abolition Movement by the first of these friends of the Negro, we cannot help
being struck with the spirit of pure christian philanthropy and universal benevolence
which shines through, and, as it were, irradiates the writings and speeches of all those
who have advocated the cause of the once friendless African, and also with the
gradual rise and steady progression of those principles which must eventually lead to the
<pb id="adams168" n="168"/>
entire extirpation of that plague-spot of the nations, Slavery. From the time
the Cardinal Ximenes protested against the introduction of Negroes into America,
to the memorable 23rd. of March, 1807, when the Abolition Bill was finally
passed by the British Legislature, and from thence to the present day there
has been a growing and spreading of that light, which is destined, under
God's blessing, to dispel the darkness that still rests upon degraded, suffering
Africa, and burst into the perfect day of Negro emancipation. Earnest and
devoted men here, and in France, and in many other parts of the European
continent, are exerting their best energies for the accomplishment of this good
end, and are gathering to their aid a weight of public opinion, which cannot
fail to overthrow the monster evil against which it is directed; while in
America, that stronghold of Slavery, the sturdy and uncompromising band of
abolitionists, deaf alike to jeers and menaces, continue to assault, what a
certain George Mc'Duffie, governor of Carolina, was once pleased to denomimate
“The <hi rend="italics">patriarchal </hi>Institution of Slavery”—”The <hi rend="italics">corner-stone</hi> of the
republican edifice.” In no professedly christian country, save that in which
it was uttered, would such a sentiment be for a moment tolerated, and even
there only by that portion of the community, whose interests, feelings, and
prejudices are all enlisted in the keeping of their fellow-men in a state of
bondage.</p>

          <p>8. It no argument against the reasonableness of the conviction expressed in the
preceding note, that Negro Slavery must eventually be abolished, to assert that the
horrors and atrocities of the Slave Trade were never greater than at the present day,
although such an assertion may be strictly true. Greatly as we must deplore the
increased sufferings of the poor Negroes, and the dreadful waste of human life
attendant on the present mode of conducting the horrible traffic, yet we are cheered
by the knowledge that that which was once open to the eye of day, and in
accordance with the recognised law of nations, is now clandestine and illegal, and
cannot under these circumstances much longer continue to exist.</p>

employed entirely in Slave-hunting expeditions into the territories of his neighbours.
We read that in 1794 the king of the Southern Foulhas, a powerful tribe in Nigritia,
employed as many as sixteen thousand men for this iniquitous purpose, and that the
