        <head>PREFACE.
</head>
        <p>THE STORY OF THE LIFE OF JOHN ANDERSON has been prepared for publication by the Editor at 
the earnest request of the Committee and of John Anderson himself, and whatever profits may 
accrue from its sale will be devoted to the benefit of Anderson, whose history must, in many 
respects, be regarded as an extraordinary one. The circumstances connected with the demand for 
his rendition are of such general interest, that the Editor makes no apology for presenting them
 in a permanent form in the following pages. He also desires to express, on his own behalf, and 
in the name of the John Anderson Committee, the warmest thanks to the Committee of the British 
and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, for the noble manner in which they vindicated the cause of 
freedom, when called upon to resist a foul wrong attempted to be perpetrated on a
<pb id="andervi" n="vi"/>
subject of the British Crown. A variety of circumstances combine to make the history 
of John Anderson one of deep interest. The novelty and peculiarity of the case itself,
 the excitement which it created in Canada, England, and the United States; the gravity 
of the proceedings to which it gave rise; the opinions of the many eminent men in Parliament,
 in the Cabinet, in Courts of Law, and of the Press, which it drew forth; the importance of 
the question to be decided, as affecting the freedom and safety of thousands of fugitive 
slaves in the British American possessions; the lofty, disinterested, and honourable position, 
which, from the first, was assumed by England; and the prompt, decided, and magnanimous conduct 
of the British Government; these, and other features of the case are brought out in the succeeding 
sketch of the brief, but singular and eventful, career of an American slave—now, 
happily, a slave no longer.</p>
        <p>In addition to the above circumstances, the history of John Anderson will be found to illustrate
 the actual condition of a slave in all countries where chattel servitude is permitted. He is the 
type and representative of eight millions of the human race— Africans and their 
descendants—who, at this hour, are held in
<pb id="andervii" n="vii"/>
debasing and cruel bondage by nominally Christian nations. In the light of the facts of Anderson's 
slave life, we see the true nature and effects of Slavery, as it
exists in the Confederate States of America, throughout the empire of Brazil, and in the islands of
 the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
        <p>The father of Anderson was a slave, who—not, that he loved kindred less, but that he loved 
freedom more—forsook his wife and little one, and became an exile, a fugitive, and an outlaw 
upon the face of the earth. The mother of Anderson was a slave, who, but a few months after she 
became a parent, was left, virtually, a widow; her natural protector—he who should have been 
her counsellor and stay, and the example and guide of her child—lost to her for ever; and she, 
while yet that child was in its infancy, severed from it, sold like a bale of merchandize, or a 
four-footed beast of the field, and sent far from the scenes of her youth and the centre of her 
associations, to labour and to die upon the cane-fields of Louisiana. Behold the havoc which the 
execrable system of slavery makes of the sacred and divine relationships of the family!</p>
        <p>The genealogy of an American slave is traced only through the maternal line. The progenitors on
 the male
<pb id="anderviii" n="viii"/>
side are rarely known in fact, and are never recognized in law. A slave, in law, has no father. 
The legislation of the Slave States makes no reference to paternal ancestry, and acknowledges the
 mother—not in respect to any natural rights, duties, or affections, but simply for the 
determination of the question of title, and for the purpose of fixing the legal <hi rend="italics">status</hi> 
of the child. The natural relation between parent and child is not considered; and hence, neither in a legal nor 
in a religious sense, has a slave-born child either a father or a mother; as is the condition of the mother, so 
is the condition of the child. This is the recognized and law-established principle, laid down for the administration 
of the brutal system of American slavery. As early as 1715, it was enacted by the state of Maryland, and it has since become the general law of the United States, that children born of slave mothers are slaves during their natural lives. It was thus that the atrocious maxim,—<hi lang="lat" rend="italics">Partus sequitor ventrum,</hi>—(the offspring follows the condition of the mother,) was introduced into the civil law; and from that day to the present, the condition of the mother has determined the fate of the child. Who is he, who does not at once perceive that this revolting and horrible maxim of civil law is one
<pb id="anderix" n="ix"/>
of the most cruel and degrading principles by which the institution of slavery, for which the rebel states are 
fighting, is distinguished? By this law, any child whose maternal ancestor, even in the remotest degree, can be shewn to have been a slave, is declared the property of him who was the owner of its mother at the time of its birth; and it is, therefore, doomed to perpetual bondage, although its paternal ancestor, at every successive generation, may have been a free white man. Where is the man of intelligence who does not instantly see that this provision of human law perverts the divine ordinance of marriage from a holy institution, into a slave-breeding commerce between the sexes; into a perpetual manufacture of property in human flesh, for the profit of the slave master; that it breaks up and destroys the parental relation, and converts the children of slavemothers into household cattle, for the pecuniary benefit of the owner; that it abrogates the commandment of the decalogue—“Honour thy father and thy mother” —and that it makes the relation, between father and mother, that of mere agents for increasing the gains of him who claims a right of property in the human chattel, whose offspring, by law, are his? Well may that eloquent defender of the rights of the injured slave, Dr. Cheever, observe—</p>
        <pb id="anderx" n="x"/>
        <p>“The essence of American slavery, the central fundamental element of cruelty and crime by which it is 
sustained and made perpetual, is just this, namely, the incessant stealing of children from their parents, by the 
factorship of the marriage relation,—perverted, corrupted, diabolized, into an engine of anguish and debasement to 
the parents, and of gain to the masters; that hath on it, more than any thing else in the world, the stamp of hell.”</p>
        <p>The particulars furnished in the following pages, of the events in the slave-life of John Anderson, and of the 
condition and treatment of his companions in bondage, though far from exhibiting slavery in its worst horrors, do
 more or less, illustrate its peculiar evils. They show that slavery is human chattelism; that it reduces beings created 
in the image of God, to the level of the beasts that perish, or the clods of the earth. Anderson was a piece of property. 
It will be seen that slavery annihilates the heaven-ordained right of marriage, and encourages concubinage and adultery; 
that slavery ruthlessly sunders every conjugal, parental and filial bond; that slavery deprives the child of the 
protection, support, example, and instruction due to it from the parent; that slavery totally neglects the moral,
<pb id="anderxi" n="xi"/>
rational and spiritual faculties of the being claimed as property; that slavery denies the use of letters, and 
abandons its victim to intellectual darkness; that slavery
transforms professing Christians into hypocrites, taskmasters and menstealers; and perverts the Word of God into a 
law in favour of robbery and oppression. Finally, that slavery is remorseless and unforgiving, and will abate no jot 
or tittle of its iniquitous demands.</p>

        <head>MISSOURI.</head>
        <argument>
          <p>The Birthplace of Anderson.—Purchase of the Louisiana Territory.— Missouri originally a part of that 
Territory.—Its Settlement by Slaveholders.— Efforts made to bring it into the Union.—“The 
Missouri Compromise.” —Its Admission in 1820.—Subsequent Repeal of the Missouri 
Compromise.—Geography, Climate, Products, and Population.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>BEFORE entering upon the narration of the personal history of John Anderson, it may not be out of place to introduce 
a notice of the State in which he was born, and in which he spent the days of his enslavement. He was “raised” 
in the territory of Missouri. The admission of Missouri into the Union was a trying crisis in the life of the Western 
Republic, and occurred when the nation was yet comparatively young.</p>
        <p>In the year 1787, and previous to the adoption of the Federal Constitution, an ordinance was passed by the Continental 
Congress for the government of “all the territories of the United States, lying to the North-West of the river Ohio. 
One of the provisions of this ordinance was as follows:—</p>
        <p>“There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory, otherwise than in punishment
<pb id="ander2" n="2"/>
of crime, whereof the parties shall be duly convicted.”</p>
        <p>When Ohio (in 1802-3) was constituted a State, the residue of the vast regions, included in the provisions of the 
ordinance of 1787, remained under the exclusive control of the Federal Government, as a part of the natural 
domain—the property of the nation, and sacred, therefore, according to the compact, to <hi rend="italics">freedom,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">free labour.</hi> It went by the name of the “Indiana Territory.” From 1802 to 1807, inclusive, efforts were yearly made to induce Congress to allow slavery for a limited period in this territory, but without effect. It will be seen in what way this Ordinance has been since treated.</p>
        <p>In 1803, the vast and indefinite territory, known by the name of Louisiana, was ceded by France to the States, for the sum 
of fifteen millions of dollars. The territory had just before been ceded by Spain to France, but without any pecuniary 
consideration. Slaveholding had been allowed under both these governments. The treaty, ceding the territory to the United 
States, guaranteed to the inhabitants their rights
as slaveholders. The State of Louisiana, according to its present limits, was fully admitted into the Union, with a State 
constitution recognizing slavery, in 1812. The rest of the territory passed under the name of the Missouri territory. 
Those who chose to dwell in this territory continued to hold slaves within its scattered and thinly populated, but 
increasing settlements.</p>
        <pb id="ander3" n="3"/>
        <p>On the assembling of Congress in 1817, a delegate from Missouri was admitted to take his seat from that territory, and 
to present petitions from sundry of its inhabitants, praying for admission into the Union. The matter was referred to committee, who made a report to the House, but nothing was done during that session. In 1818, the subject was again introduced, when a resolution passed the House to the effect that Missouri should be admitted, provided—“That the further introduction of slavery, or involuntary servitude be prohibited, except for the punishment of crimes, whereof the party should be duly convicted; and that all children of slaves, born within the said State after the admission thereof into the Union, shall be free, but may be held to service until the age of twenty-five years.” The vote upon this resolution was 87 ayes to 76 noes. The bill, upon the basis of this resolution, was read a third time—ayes, 98; noes, 56. This bill was sent up to the Senate, and was returned to the House with the provisions contained in the above resolution <hi rend="italics">struck out.</hi> The Senate adhered to its amendment, and remanded the bill to the House. The House adhered to its resolution, so the bill was lost in the struggle. A motion was then made to organize the Southern portion of the territory into a State under the name of Arkansas, whereupon it was attempted to apply the same provisions to that State also; but, ultimately, the bill for organization passed without any allusion to slavery. Arkansas thus became a slave State, and was fully admitted as such in 1836.</p>
        <pb id="ander4" n="4"/>
        <p>The second great struggle regarding Missouri, was in the following year, 1819, on the assembling of a new Congress.
 This protracted and celebrated conflict, between the friends of the <hi rend="italics">extension</hi> of slavery, and the friends of <hi rend="italics">restriction,</hi> ended in a compromise between the extreme men of the two parties. The champions of <hi rend="italics">extension</hi> were conciliated by the agreement to receive Missouri as a slave State; and the leaders of the <hi rend="italics">non-extensionists</hi> were won over by the consent of their opponents to a provision that slavery should, for ever afterwards, be excluded from all the territories lying north and west of Missouri. It was, in effect, an offer from the milder opponents of slavery restriction to the moderate and flexible advocates of that restriction. “Let us,” said the former, “have slavery in Missouri, and we will unite with you in excluding it from all the uninhabited territories north and west of that state.” It was, in substance, an agreement between the North and the South to that effect, though the more determined champions, whether of slavery extension or slavery restriction, did not unite in it. Such was the virtual termination of the struggle to prohibit slavery in Missouri: the opposition was overcome by the plan of offering instead thereof, an exclusion of slavery from the then Federal territory west and north of that State. This was the great Missouri compromise; the accomplishment of which is due, mainly, to the efforts of the great American statesmen, Henry Clay.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the solemnity of the compact then
<pb id="ander5" n="5"/>
entered into, and the universal belief of the people of the free states that it would be perpetual, it was repealed by a 
clause in the fourteenth section of a Bill for the organization of the territory of Nebraska, the words of which are as follows:—</p>
        <p>“That the constitution and laws of the United States which are not locally inapplicable, shall have the same force
 and effect within the said territory of Nebraska as elsewhere within the United States, except the eighth section of the Act preparatory to the admission of Missouri into the Union, approved March 6th, 1820; which being inconsistent with the principles of nonintervention by Congress with slavery in the states and territories, as recognized by the legislation of 1850, commonly called the compromise measures, is hereby declared inoperative and void; it being the true intent and meaning of this Act not to legislate slavery into any territory or state, <hi rend="italics">nor to exclude it therefrom,</hi> but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the constitution of the United States.”</p>
        <p>This repealing section of the Bill at once removed every impediment to the introduction of slavery into the vast and as
 yet unpeopled territories of the North-West, and led to the attempt made to establish slavery in Kansas, and all the outrages, horrors, and blood which were the consequence.</p>
        <p>Missouri is bounded on the north by Iowa, on the west by the Indian territory, on the east by the Mississippi,
<pb id="ander6" n="6"/>
which separates it from Illinois, Kentucky, and Tennessee, and south by the State of Arkansas. Its length is 280 miles, and its medium breadth about 230; the area being about 65,000 square miles. Besides the great rivers, the Missouri and Mississippi, the country is watered by others of inferior magnitude, among the largest of which are the Osage, the Sult, the Chariton, the Gasconade, the Maranec or Merrimac, the Big Black, and the St. Francis.</p>
        <p>The best and most thickly inhabited portions of the State are those lying between the Mississippi and the Missouri. Beyond the western limit of the State there is an almost boundless region of prairie land. A great part of the country is admirably adapted for the growth of wheat, rye, and oats. Indian corn is cultivated to the highest perfection, yielding from seventy to seventy-five bushels to the acre. With an adequate population, under the stimulus of free labour, Missouri might be made to produce wheat for all the inhabitants of the United States, eastward of the Rocky Mountains, and establish a claim to be regarded as one of the most prolific granaries in the world.</p>
        <p>Missouri, above any other State in the Union abounds in fruits. The pumpkin, squash, and melon, are produced in profusion. The apple attains its utmost development and beauty. The vine is common throughout the country; one species of grapes ripens in June, a second in October, and a third during the winter. The peach is luxuriant and abundant beyond description;
<pb id="ander7" n="7"/>
and the pear, the apricot, and the melon thrive well. The mulberry tree is common throughout the woods, affording the means of breeding the silk-worm to any extent, and thereby raising Missouri to the highest position among the middle States as a country for the production of raw silk. Above all other regions in North America, Missouri is the land of flowers. In the season, every prairie is an immense flower-garden. In the early stages of spring there is a generation of flowers whose prevalent tint is peach blow. To this succeeds one whose line is of a deeper red, then follows one of yellow, and to the latest period of autumn the widely extended prairies are redolent of flowers exhibiting a golden lustre. Bears, wolves, panthers, buffaloes, elks, and deer, are found in Missouri. There are also myriads of waterfowl—swans, pelicans, cranes, geese, and ducks; and besides prairie hens, two large and beautiful kinds of grouse, turtle doves, and wood pigeons. The Virginia nightingale and parroquet are also frequently visitors.</p>
        <p>The population of Missouri was, in 1810, 19,833; in 1820, 66,586; in 1830, 140,074; in 1840, 383,702, of whom 58,240 were slaves. In 1850, the free population was 594,622, and in 1860, 1,085,596; shewing an increase, in ten years, of 590,974. In 1850, the slaves were 87,422, and in 1860, 115,619; being an increase of only 28,197. It will thus be seen that there has been but a small positive increase of slaves, while, compared with the free population, which has doubled, there has been an enormous relative decrease.</p>

        <head>ANDERSON'S SLAVE LIFE.</head>
        <argument>
          <p>His Parentage.—The Fate of his Father and Mother.—His Life on the Plantation.—His Marriage.—Is 
Sold and separated from his Wife.— Character of his new Master.—Slaveholders' Morality. — Why he resolved to Run Away.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>LIKE the great majority of those reared under the institution of American slavery, Anderson is ignorant of the precise 
date of his birth, but believes that he is at the present time thirty-one or thirty-two years of age. His mother was the
 property of a person named Moses Burton, of the town of Fayette, Howard County, Missouri. Burton cultivated a farm, raised tobacco, and at the same time followed the business of a carpenter, and was the owner of several slaves. Anderson, at his birth, according to the law referred to in a preceding chapter, became the chattel personal of the man who claimed his mother, and was reckoned among his live stock. As he increased in years he increased in value, until at the age of manhood he was worth a thousand dollars, and was sold for that sum. During the time he was with his first master he was known as Jack Burton.</p>
        <pb id="ander9" n="9"/>
        <p>Anderson cannot remember his father, but has heard him described as a person of light mulatto complexion, who pursued the 
occupation of a servant on board the steam boats employed on the Mississippi. While Anderson was yet an infant, his father 
made his escape from slavery, and, it was believed, went to South America. When seven years of age, his mother, having 
given offence to her master, was sold to a negro trader for transportation to the slave market of New Orleans, 
and he was thus left an orphan. It was his good fortune, however, to possess a mistress of a kind disposition, who supplied, in a great degree, the place of the parents of whom he had been deprived. He invariably speaks of Mrs. Burton in terms of gratitude and affection, calls her his “mother,” and says he was “raised” by her. This lady lived until Anderson was about nineteen.</p>
        <p>Anderson grew up upon his master's farm, and was early put to agricultural pursuits. The produce of the land was 
tobacco, 
wheat, Indian corn, and various kinds of fruits. Anderson's youth does not appear to have passed unhappily. The whip
 was
 occasionally in requisition, and he, doubtless, sometimes felt its smart in common with the other boys on the farm. 
But his time, upon the whole, appears to have passed pleasantly. He was fond of athletic sports, such as running,
 jumping, and wrestling; enjoyed his evenings after the labours of the day; and joined with eagerness in the 
frolics and festivities permitted to the Negroes during
<pb id="ander10" n="10"/>
the Christmas holiday, which is the carnival and saturnalia of the plantation Negroes of the South.</p>
        <p>Thus the time passed away, and Anderson became a man. He was expert in all the duties of the farm, could 
manage the tobacco crop for his master, and was
allowed to cultivate a little patch on his own account, and also to sell the produce for his own benefit.
 This <hi lang="lat" rend="italics">peculium</hi> is not uncommon in Missouri; and slaves, not
unfrequently, by availing themselves of the privilege, are enabled to purchase their freedom with the money they obtain 
for that which they cultivate in their over-hours.</p>
        <p>Anderson states that he made a profession of religion among the Freewill Baptists, and attended the ordinances 
of religion
 among the members of that denomination. Like other young men he, in due time, also entered into the matrimonial
 relation. The person whom he chose to be his future help-meet was Maria Tomlin, the daughter of Lewis Tomlin. 
Lewis had been a slave, but had obtained his freedom by purchase—had also purchased his wife, and was,
 when Anderson left Missouri, making his living as a barber in the town of Fayette. This marriage was contracted 
by the parties agreeing to live together as man and wife, and promising to be faithful to each other. A colored 
minister was present when Anderson pledged his troth to Maria. They were married at Christmas, 1850, and towards 
the close of 1851 the union was crowned by the birth of child. Maria was a slave upon the farm of Mr. Samuel
<pb id="ander11" n="11"/>
Brown, distant about two miles from the farm of Burton. Maria had been previously married to a slave of the name 
of Green 
Shepherd, by whom she had had two children, the eldest, Emily, now about thirteen; the second, a boy, now about 
eleven. She had been a widow twelve months when Anderson married her. She stipulated that Anderson should act 
the part of a father to her children, and that, should he succeed in obtaining his own freedom, and afterwards 
possess the means, he should exert himself as much for the freedom of his step-children as for the freedom of 
his own, which he agreed to do.</p>
        <p>As nearly as it can be ascertained, with the assistance of Anderson, it was about the middle of August, 1853, when Burton 
effected the sale of Anderson to a
man of the name of McDonald, whose residence was thirty miles distant from that of Brown, the owner of Anderson's wife. 
This separation was, naturally, a
great trial to the young husband, and it was rendered more bitter by McDonald's refusal to permit Anderson to visit his 
wife and infant child. When Anderson requested a pass to return and see his wife and infant, he was told that he must
 abandon and forget them, and take a new wife, or mistress, from amongst the slaves of his present owner. Such is the 
humanity and morality of the owners of slaves in America! The motive which influenced McDonald was obvious, and was perfectly understood by Anderson. His master wished him to become the father of children who should
<pb n="12"/>
be born upon his farm, who should call <hi rend="italics">his</hi> slave <hi rend="italics">mother,</hi> and, hence, 
become his property, and increase the number of his live human stock.</p>
        <p>To such an arrangement Anderson determined he would never be a party, and further, that if his master insisted upon his 
compliance, he would adopt means for making his escape from Missouri, and for reaching the free soil of Canada, from 
whose shores he might hurl defiance at slaveholders and kidnappers, secure of the protection of British law, and the 
sympathy and support of British philanthropy. At this time Anderson was ignorant of the nature of international treaties 
and the meaning of extradition laws.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
        <head>ANDERSON'S ESCAPE FROM SLAVERY.—DESPERATE
<lb/>STRUGGLE FOR LIFE AND LIBERTY.</head>
        <argument>
          <p>Leaves the Plantation.—Bids farewell to his Wife and Child.—Encounters Diggs, a
 Slaveholder.—“Give 
me Liberty, or give me Death.”—Wounds his Adversary and Flies.—Perilous Journey through the 
Woods.—Reaches the State of Illinois.—Hospitality of an English Settler.—Proceeds to Chicago.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>As Anderson's master insisted that he should follow the practice usual among plantation slaves, he at once proceeded to 
carry out his resolution to bid Mr. McDonald and slavery, “good bye.” He chose a Sunday at the latter end 
of September (having been but six or seven weeks in his new position) for his departure. The day seemed favourable
 for his project, as his master had been summoned from home to attend a church meeting, called to investigate a 
charge brought against a religious slaveholder of <hi rend="italics">whipping a slave to death!</hi> To aid him 
in his flight he borrowed one of his master's mules, and two hours before daybreak made fast his blankets on the
 back of the mule, took a rope, some twenty feet long, to be of use in making a raft, and helping himself to a
 bridle, started for a ferry on the Missouri river.
<pb id="ander14" n="14"/>
This river was about thirty-five miles from the point of starting. Here he tried to induce the ferryman to give him a
 passage across, but being unable to produce a pass was compelled to retire. He betook himself to the wood and lay till
 night, when he returned to the river, and was about to seize a boat that was lying on the bank, when some one appearing,
 he was obliged a second time to retreat into the woods. About two hours before sun-rise he ventured again to the river side, and was fortunate enough to find a skiff upon the bank, but without oars. Furnishing himself with a piece of bark for a paddle, he launched the boat and succeeded in reaching the opposite bank, where he landed and drew up the skiff. This was the first time
he had ever been in a boat. He immediately started for Fayette, the residence of his father-in-law. It was yet dark. 
Fayette was about six miles away, but he was fortunate enough to get a lift part of the way by a stage.</p>
        <p>To Lewis Tomlin, Anderson made known his intention of making his way to Canada, and his determination to surrender his 
life rather than be captured in his attempt to gain his liberty. His father-in-law did not attempt to dissuade him from 
his purpose, and offered him a pistol for the defence of his person, which, however, he declined, saying he had a dirk 
knife which he thought would be sufficient for his purpose. He next visited his wife, with whom he had a brief and 
affecting interview; and after caressing his infant child, bade both
<pb id="ander15" n="15"/>
farewell, and hastened forth upon an unknown path to the soil whose touch gives freedom to the slave. He returned to 
Fayette to the roof of his father-in-law, and bidding him also adieu, pursued his journey.</p>
        <p>We now come to Anderson's encounter with the man whom he is charged, under the laws of Missouri, with “wilfully,
 maliciously, and feloniously stabbing and killing.”</p>
        <p>About noon on Tuesday (the third day of his departure from McDonald's plantation), Anderson, while pursuing his 
journey to the North, passed a field belonging to one Seneca T. P. Diggs, who was at the time engaged in 
superintending the drying of tobacco. Diggs demanded of him who he was, where he was going, and whether he had the 
necessary pass. It should be known that, according to the law of the State of Missouri, any Negro, found more than 
twenty miles from the plantation 
of his master without a pass, may be arrested, and that the person taking him back is entitled to a reward of five 
dollars and mileage, at the rate of ten cents or fivepence per mile.</p>
        <p>Anderson confessed to being without a pass, but represented that he had legitimate business in that direction, and 
that he was bound on that business to a certain place. Diggs told him to accompany him to the house, saying he would 
give him some dinner and then shew him the way. This offer Anderson declined, upon which Diggs expressed his belief that
 Anderson was a runaway, and that he should be restored to
<pb id="ander16" n="16"/>
his owner. Upon this Anderson immediately started; Diggs calling to three of his Negroes, saying, “Catch that 
runaway, and I will give you the reward.” Diggs also pursued, having at the time an axe in his hand, which he 
threw at Anderson, but without hitting him. After about an hour's pursuit, Anderson fled into the woods, followed by 
the Negroes, whose number had been increased to half-a-dozen. When they had hunted Anderson for two or three hours 
they were joined by Diggs, who encouraged his slaves to seize the fugitive, and at last issued an order that they should 
take him dead or alive. Anderson had 
repeatedly shown his dirk knife, and declared that he would not be taken alive. He was now exhausted, and Diggs was 
able to come up with him, brandishing at the time a club; the Negroes, also, were near and armed, each with a similar 
weapon. Anderson's sole hope of escape now lay in the use of his knife. With this he struck a blow at Diggs and retired 
from the spot; but hearing him repeat his order that the slaves should take him dead or alive, and fearing that he had not inflicted 
sufficient injury to prevent pursuit, he returned and again struck Diggs, and effectually disarmed him. The Negroes 
followed for a short distance, 
but being advised by Anderson to go back and say they could not take him, they retired and left him to himself.</p>
        <p>Anderson, the same night returned to his wife and informed her of what had transpired. She said that a rumour had reached her master's plantation of some old
<pb id="ander17" n="17"/>
slaveholder having been struck by a Negro with a knife, and exhorted him at once to make his way out of the State with all possible speed. She was much frightened when informed that her husband was the man who had committed the act of which she had already heard. After receiving a shirt or two from his wife, he again started for the land of true liberty, and has seen neither wife, nor child, nor his birthplace since.</p>
        <p>Anderson commenced his distant and perilous journey with only a dollar and-a-half in his pocket. His travelling was, for the most part, performed during the night, and what rest he got he took, where he thought himself most secure, in the day time. He was often greatly in want of food, and for days together had to subsist upon what fell in his way—corn, hazelnuts, pawpaws, or raw potatoes. He had several narrow escapes from being captured. On one occasion, while resting himself
 by the wayside, a man on horseback rode up, and, charging 
him with being a fugitive slave, would have made him a prisoner, but he fled into a neighbouring field, and succeeded in concealing himself amongst some tall Indian corn. In the evening he ventured again into the public road, and observing a fire in the wood not far distant, and imagining that some of his own people might be engaged husking corn, he drew near the spot, and discovered, just in time to avoid the trap 
that had been set for him, that the fire had been kindled by the man from whose clutches he 
had escaped during the day. His enemy had adopted this method of decoying him into his ambush.</p>
        <pb id="ander18" n="18"/>
        <p>Under the provocation of extreme hunger, Anderson was
sometimes impelled to levy contributions upon the eatable
property of those whose dwellings lay in his way. Creeping
into the back kitchen of a farm house, he filled one of his
pockets with salt, and from a farm yard at another place he
helped himself to three chickens, and having pulled their
necks, retired into the woods to regale himself upon their flesh.
He speedily deprived two of them of their feathers and roasted
them; but in the midst of his repast, though not until he had
nearly picked the bones of both birds, he was alarmed by the
sounds of approaching footsteps, when, suspecting that the
owner of the chickens was in pursuit, he hastily decamped,
carrying the uncooked chicken with him, which was his entire
supply of food during the next two days. He crossed the
Mississippi as he had done the Missouri, by using a boat
which he found on the bank. It was now Saturday night, and
he had been just a fortnight absent from the plantation of
McDonald, and had gained the free State of Illinois. Knowing
however, that successful attempts had been made to recover
fugitives in that State, he did not feel secure, and therefore
resolved to observe the same circumspection he had
practised in Missouri.</p>
        <p>On the following day providence directed his footsteps to the
threshold of an English settler, who gave him a cordial
reception, and offered him a night's lodging. Before putting him
to bed, his host furnished him with a good supper. Anderson's
mind was afterwards
<pb id="ander19" n="19"/>
greatly disturbed, and his apprehensions excited, by  seeing a gun in his lodging room, which he 
thought might be kept for the purpose of overcoming runaway
subjects like himself. His weariness, however, soon got the better of his fears, and after a long and sound sleep he 
rose much refreshed. Before breakfast his kind entertainer supplied him with a razor, and he was enabled to indulge 
in the luxury of a shave. In addition to a substantial breakfast, the good-hearted Englishman filled his pockets with 
apples and bread, and he departed on his way well rested, well cleansed, well fed, and well supplied. After several 
adventures, some of them of a critical nature, during the day and the night that succeeded, Anderson again ventured to
present himself at the door of a white man's dwelling. Here he got a breakfast, and purchased a loaf of bread of the 
housewife. The farmer undertook to direct him, and went forth with him under pretence of doing so. They had not 
proceeded far, however, when Anderson perceived that the man was leading him back towards the house, through a field 
in which two of his sons were working. Fearful that he
was about to be betrayed, Anderson took to flight, and soon left the farmer and his sons far behind him.</p>
        <p>At the end of two days he struck a branch of the Illinois river, which he crossed, and after proceeding some distance,
 came to a railway track, with the use of which he
was acquainted. He kept by this track until he arrived within a short distance of Bloomington.</p>
        <pb id="ander20" n="20"/>
        <p>After various adventures he overtook some teams which were on the way to a place called Rock Island, and 
being permitted to mount one of them he reached the town that evening. The next day he hired himself to 
a barber, though quite ignorant of the art of shaving any one besides himself, but stayed with him only two 
days, and then
started for Chicago, his fare being paid by a society of abolitionists. In Chicago, Anderson lived for three
 weeks with another barber, and then left for Windsor, Upper
Canada, where he safely arrived.</p>

        <head>ANDERSON BENEATH THE BRITISH FLAG.</head>
        <argument>
          <p>Arrives at Windsor, Upper Canada.—His first employment as a Free man.—  Discovers a plot to got him back 
to slavery.—Changes his name and residence.—For five years remains unmolested.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>ANDERSON reached Windsor in the month of September, 1853, and obtained employment as a labourer on the Great Western 
Railway of Canada, on that part of the line lying between Windsor and Chatham, and was paid at the rate of
about seven shillings per day; his work consisted in laying “ties” for the rails, and the job lasted six 
or seven weeks. During the month of October, he got a friend to write two letters to his wife in Missouri, one of 
which he sent to the care of Tomlin, his wife's father, and the other to a free coloured man, of the name of Allen, 
following the trade of a shoemaker, in the town of Fayette; the information in both
letters was the same—to the effect that he had got safely to Detroit. When he had finished his job upon the 
railway, he returned to Windsor; with his earnings he purchased himself some clothes and entered the institution of
 Mr. William Bibb  —a fugitive slave, who had established
<pb id="ander22" n="22"/>
a school—resolving to devote one half of his time to his education, and the other half to manual labour, and thus be able to support himself and attend school at the
same time. He found in a lady of the name of Evelyn a very kind friend; she was a widow, and obtained her living by teaching. This lady sent for Anderson to inform him that a letter had arrived in Windsor, stating that his wife and children had reached Detroit, and were waiting for him. Mrs. Evelyn read the letter to him,
and told him it was her belief that it had been sent to decoy him across the river into the State of Michigan, and that if he crossed he would, in all probability, be seized and carried to Missouri. Mrs. Evelyn advised him to leave the institution, to remove to Chatham, and the better to avoid detection, to assume another name. He acted according to this counsel, and making up a small bundle of clothes, and leaving his trunk under the care of a Mrs. Jackson, immediately started for Chatham, which place was sixty or seventy miles from Windsor; he avoided the high road, and walked as far as Belle River, where he took the railway cars for Chatham. This change of residence took place in the second or third week of April, 1854. In Chatham he took another name. In Missouri he had always been called Jack, in Windsor he went by the name of John Anderson, but in Chatham he became James Hamilton. This was the name of a coloured man—like himself, a fugitive— who
resided in the town, and who was old enough to pass for his father. In Chatham, Anderson went to wood
<pb id="ander23" n="23"/>
chopping, by the “cord,” for which he was paid at the rate of three and sixpence per cord, and he could do on an average two cords a day. He had not been many weeks in
Chatham before a rumour spread among the coloured people of the place, that certain parties were on the look-out for him, and that a reward had been offered for his
apprehension. The report alarmed him, and he deemed it advisable to go to a lawyer, and tell him in what way he had made his escape from slavery, and at the same time, take his advice as to the course he should pursue. Having related to him all the facts of the case, the lawyer told him he had better leave the neighbourhood, and again change his name, for though his enemies might not be able to “get him,” they might give him a “heap of trouble.”</p>
        <p>It is difficult in the absence of reliable information, to furnish any connected account of the proceedings of Anderson during the five following years of his residence in
Canada. He has stated that he travelled from place to place, and pursued various employments, until having learned the trade of a mason and plasterer, he settled down in the town of Caledonia, where he became the owner of a house. With this brief notice of his first six years of freedom, we proceed to record those events in his history, which excited so much public attention, and made his name so widely known.</p>

          <p>Anderson's confidence is betrayed.—He is arrested, and afterwards
released.—He is arrested a second time, and after some weeks confinement discharged.—He is a third time arrested, and is committed to the County Jail.—His rendition is demanded.—Diplomatic correspondence.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>ABOUT the commencement of the year 1860, Anderson was imprudent enough to mention, in confidence, to a person of the name of Wynne, with whom he was at
the time on terms of intimate friendship, the facts connected with his escape from slavery, including his encounter with Diggs. Wynne, in retaliation for some
offence given him by Anderson, reported what he had heard to a Justice of the Peace of the name of Mathews; who, upon the information thus furnished, caused the
fugitive to be arrested. It is believed that he (Mathews) further communicated the fact of Anderson's capture to the friends of the deceased Diggs. After several weeks' imprisonment—no witnesses appearing, Anderson was released. But on the 30th of April, and
<pb id="ander25" n="25"/>
only three days after his discharge, he was again arrested on the information of a man of the name of Gunning—a detective police officer, and professional slave-catcher, who came over from Detroit, in the State of Michigan, and deposed on oath, that he “verily believed Anderson had wilfully, deliberately, and maliciously murdered Diggs, on the 28th of September, 1853.”</p>
        <p>After some additional weeks imprisonment, Anderson was again set at liberty through the interposition of legal aid; but the man Gunning did not abandon his intention of procuring his extradition. Accordingly on his return to the United
States, Gunning applied himself to the obtaining of evidence from Missouri in support of his original charge, and returning with witnesses, Anderson was once more arrested, and brought up for examination. The case was gone into on the
27th of September, when there appeared as witnesses, against him, William C. Baker, of Howard County, Missouri; also, two sons of the deceased Diggs; also a lawyer of the name of Holliday; also a constable of the name of Hazlehurst, and
finally, a slave called Phil. The evidence of these witnesses having been taken, Anderson was committed to the common jail of Brantford, “to be there safely kept, until he should be delivered by due course of law.” The warrant was dated the
28th of September, and was signed by Mathews and two other Justices of the Peace.</p>
        <p>There appears to have been an immediate application by Anderson's prosecutors to Washington, as on the
<pb id="ander26" n="26"/>
2nd of October, the Secretary of State, General Cass, addressed a letter to the British Minister, requesting her Majesty's government to issue the necessary warrant to “deliver up the person of John Anderson, otherwise called Jack, a man of colour, charged with the commission of murder in the State of Missouri.” There was an important omission in this official requisition. John Anderson was described simply as <hi rend="italics">a coloured man</hi> and not as a <hi rend="italics">slave;</hi> and therefore, a piece of property. This omission might have been attended with serious if not fatal consequences, as the
proceedings, both at the British Embassy at Washington, and at the Foreign and Colonial offices in London, were based upon the presumption that Anderson was a free man, and that he was charged with the crime of murder in the capacity of a free man. At a later date, April 8th, 1861, Lord Lyons, in a despatch to Lord John Russell, says,—“When I despatched the requisition for the surrender, to Canada, I was not aware that John Anderson had been a slave, or that there were any peculiar circumstances in the case.”</p>
        <p>Lord Lyons, on receiving the requisition of General Cass, transmitted it to the Foreign office in London, and on the 22nd of October, 1860, Lord John Russell requested the Secretary of State for the Colonies “to take the necessary steps for complying with the application should there be no objection thereto.” Accordingly, on the 27th of October, a despatch from the Colonial office, and a letter from the
Foreign office, went out to Canada,
<pb id="ander27" n="27"/>
instructing Sir Edmund Head “to take such measures as were authorized by the laws of Canada, for the extradition to the authorities of the State of Missouri, of the person of John Anderson, otherwise called Jack, charged with the commission of murder in that State.”</p>

              <div1 type="letter">
                <p>“To His Excellency the Governor-General of Canada, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
                <p>“The petition of the undersigned, John Anderson, confined in the jail of the county of Brantford, humbly 
showeth:—</p>
                <p>“That your petitioner was born in the state of Missouri, one of the United States of America.</p>
                <p>“That to the best of his knowledge he is of the age of thirty years.</p>
                <p>“That he was the slave of Burton and another, in the year one thousand eight hundred and fifty-one. That 
the plantation of Burton and the other, was within about thirty
miles from the plantation of Samuel Brown. That in the last mentioned year your petitioner was married to one 
Maria Tomlin, who was the daughter of Tomlin, who had purchased his liberty from his master. That about six weeks before he formed the determination to come to Canada, for the purpose of obtaining his freedom, he was sold and transferred by said Burton, and his partner, to one MacDonnell, who lived about thirty miles distant from your petitioner's wife.</p>
                <p>“That your petitioner had always felt that he had a right to his freedom.</p>
                <p>“That he had never done anything to forfeit his liberty, and was not subject to any restraint through crime.</p>
                <p>“That he might lawfully use any means within his power to obtain his liberty, and with that object ran away
 from MacDonnell. That he went to his wife,
<pb id="ander30" n="30"/>
who was a slave of, and lived with Samuel Brown, and consulted with her as to his intentions, and she concurred 
with him in his views, with an ultimate hope as to herself, and a young child, then about eight months old, the
 issue of our marriage, obtaining their liberty.</p>
                <p>“That while he was then there he was pursued, but escaped. That in his course to Canada he had to pass the
 plantation of Seneca F. T. Diggs, and that while passing it
he was accosted in nearly the manner mentioned in the evidence transmitted to your Excellency. That he made the 
excuse of wishing to go to Givens's, so that he, Mr. Diggs, would allow him to pass.</p>
                <p>“That this will be manifest, or otherwise, your petitioner could have had no reason, under the evidence, 
for attempting to escape.</p>
                <p>“That when said Diggs refused to allow this excuse for not having a pass, your petitioner found it necessary to make his escape, and endeavoured to do so.</p>
                <p>“That your petitioner was run down, having been chased for nearly an hour in a circle, and at the moment he was looking for success, Mr. Diggs appeared before him.</p>
                <p>“That he could not turn, his pursuers being at his heels with clubs, and being borne on by the first impulse, he dashed against said Diggs with an open knife, with which
he had threatened his pursuers, as will appear from the evidence of Phil, hereto annexed, which is nearly true; whether your petitioner struck with it more than once, he cannot recollect; but whatever sudden impulse bid, that he did to obtain his liberty. That your petitioner
<pb id="ander31" n="31"/>
was imprisoned for about the space of three weeks, last spring, on this charge; but as no one appeared against him,
 he was discharged. That another warrant was issued against him for his arrest for the same crime, on the third day
 after his discharge, on an information quite insufficient, as he is advised.</p>
                <p>“That your petitioner was not aware of such second warrant having been issued until he was arrested in the town 
of Simcoe, about two weeks since. That he had gone from Caledonia, where he resided at the time of his arrest, in the
 hope of obtaining employment at his trade as a mason. That your petitioner therefore prays that your Excellency will 
be graciously pleased to withhold an order delivering your petitioner to the authorities of the state of Missouri,
 inasmuch as by the British law he is entitled to be free there, and the evidence shows that he only used such force
 as was necessary to maintain that freedom there; and your petitioner, as in duty bound, will ever pray.”</p>

        <p>The article of the Ashburton treaty, under which the extradition of Anderson was claimed, is as follows:—</p>
        <p>“It is agreed that her Britannic Majesty and the United States shall, upon mutual requisitions by them or their 
ministers, officers, or authorities, respectively made,
<pb id="ander32" n="32"/>
deliver up to justice all persons, who, being charged with the crime of murder, or assault with intent to commit 
murder, or piracy, or arson, or robbery, or forgery, or the utterance of forged paper, committed within the 
jurisdiction of either, shall seek an asylum, or be found within the territories of the either, provided that this 
shall only be done upon such evidence of criminality, as, according to the laws of the place where the fugitive or
 person so charged shall be found, would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial, if the crime or offence
 had there been
committed; and the respective judges, or other magistrates of the two governments, shall have power, jurisdiction, 
and authority, upon complaint made under oath, to issue a warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive or person so 
charged, that he may be brought before such judges or other magistrates respectively, to the end that the evidence of criminality may be heard and considered; and if, on such hearing, the evidence be deemed sufficient to sustain the charge, it shall be the duty of the examining judge or magistrate, to certify the same to the proper executive authority, that a warrant may issue for the surrender of such fugitive. The expense of such apprehension and delivery, shall be borne and defrayed by the party who makes the requisition and receives the fugitive.”</p>
        <p>The act of the Canadian Legislature, prescribing the duties of the judicial and executive officers under the treaty, reads as follows:—</p>
        <p>“Upon complaint made under oath or affirmation,
<pb id="ander33" n="33"/>
charging any person found within the limits of this province, with having committed, within the jurisdiction of the United States of America, or of any of such States, any of the crimes enumerated or provided for by the said treaty, any of the judges of any of Her Majesty's superior courts, in this province, or any of Her Majesty's justices of the peace in the same, may issue his warrant for the apprehension of the person so charged, that he may be brought before such judge or justice of the peace, to the end that the evidence of criminality may be heard and considered; and if on such hearing, the evidence be deemed sufficient, by him, to sustain the charge according to the laws of this province, if the offence alleged had been committed herein, he shall certify the same, together with a copy of all the testimony taken before him, to the governor, that a warrant may issue, upon the requisition of the proper authorities of the said United States, or any of such states, for the surrender of such person, according to the stipulation of the said treaty; and the said judge, or the said justice of the peace, shall issue his warrant for the commitment of the person, so charged, to the proper jail, there to remain until such surrender be made, or until such person be discharged according to law.” (12 Vic. c. 19, s. 1.)</p>
        <p>On behalf of the Crown it was urged, that the offence of Anderson was one which, if committed in Canada, would subject him to trial for murder; that Diggs, in attempting to arrest Anderson, was engaged in enforcing the laws of Missouri, and therefore the latter was clearly
<pb id="ander34" n="34"/>
guilty of murder, and ought to be given up in obedience to the requisition of the United States Government. On behalf 
of the prisoner it was contended, that the proceedings of the committing magistrate, were, in some respects, illegal;
 that the affidavit of Diggs's slave was improperly admitted, the witness being under constraint; but, mainly, that a
 slave attempting to escape from bondage, and killing the person who attempted to re-enslave him, did not, according 
to the common law, commit murder, but justifiable homicide, and that the rendition of Anderson, would be a virtual 
recognition, on British soil, of the slave laws of the United States.</p>

        <head>THE OPINIONS OF THE JUDGES.</head>
        <argument>
          <p>The 15th of December, 1860.—Intense Excitement within and around the Court House in Toronto.—Description 
of the Crowd.—Appearance and Demeanour of Anderson.—Adverse Decision of the Bench.—Remarks of Mr. 
Justice McLean in favour of Anderson's Discharge. —Anderson is Remanded to Prison.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>THE court room, on the 15th of December, was densely crowded with persons eager to learn the decision upon which the
 fate of the prisoner hung. Would he be delivered
over to the tender mercies of slaveholders' law—the essence of cruelty and injustice—or would he be declared 
a free man, and go forth to inhale the atmosphere, and walk in the light of liberty? That was the question. Would he be 
pronounced a fugitive from justice—a criminal, a felon, and a murderer; or would he be proclaimed a man who had 
vindicated, in his own person, the rights of the whole human race, and in obedience to the law of nature, and in 
accordance with the
universally allowed natural prerogative of our species, had struck a justifiable blow in defence of his personal liberty?
 Amongst the audience that awaited the decision of the bench were many persons of the same colour as the prisoner. They, 
too, had been
<pb id="ander36" n="36"/>
slaves—they, too, were fugitives from the house of bondage, and if Anderson were surrendered, their liberty would be placed in jeopardy, and they also might be dragged back to the toils of slavery from which they had escaped. The multitude on the outside of the court room presented an extraordinary spectacle: men of all ranks, degrees, and complexions, were animated by a common hope that, in the case to be adjudicated, <hi rend="italics">right</hi> would triumph over <hi rend="italics">might.</hi> The police mustered in large numbers, and piled their muskets in front of the hall; but no disposition to commit violence was manifested by the crowd. The people could not bring themselves to believe that the Judges would decide against the fugitive, and were confident that the law would <hi rend="italics">set him free.</hi> In anxious expectation, the groups assembled within the court room awaited the delivery of judgment on some ordinary cases, and there was an eager stir when the prisoner, who had been freed from his fetters in the anteroom, entered the chamber, and was accommodated with a seat within the bar. He was described by a local paper as a stout-built man of middle height, and of a very deep yellow complexion, with a full development of forehead, and a countenance in which mildness and intelligence were strongly marked. He looked round upon the faces of the crowd, but apparently thinking that its sympathy could not avail him, he turned his gaze upon the Judges, and, with manifest intelligence, collected himself to listen to their decision—a deep sigh now and then escaping from his
<pb id="ander37" n="37"/>
broad chest. It must have been an anxious moment when, as the clock struck the hour of noon, the Chief Justice produced his paper and began to read. The life or death of a human being hung on his words. The liberties of hundreds of self-emancipated slaves depended upon the opinion of three fallible men! The thought must involuntarily have suggested itself to many—“Was this poor fellow, after he had by desperate adventure achieved his liberty, and enjoyed its sweets for more than five years, to be sent back to certain slavery, if not death? Were the hundreds of fugitives in a province of the British crown, who had committed what the laws of the slave states denominate felonies in effecting their escape, to be henceforth at the mercy of
the man-stealer?”</p>
        <p>Chief Justice Robinson and Mr. Justice Burns concurred in <hi rend="italics">refusing</hi> the application for Anderson's discharge. Mr. Justice McLean dissented, on the grounds which every sincere hater of slavery, and everyone who admits the equal manhood of the black man, must deem conclusive. On a review of the proceedings of the Justice (Mathews), and the evidence in the case, he remarked:—</p>
        <p>“Looking, then, at all the testimony taken before the justice of the peace, and rejecting such portion as is unnecessary and inadmissible, there is not a witness who connects the prisoner with the stabbing of Diggs, unless it be Thomas Diggs, in his statement of the death-bed declarations of his father to him, and these
<pb id="ander38" n="38"/>
only shew that the negro by whom Diggs was stabbed made certain declarations as to himself and his identity, which would 
be true if made by the prisoner; but rejecting
the deposition of the slave Phil there is no testimony which establishes satisfactorily that the prisoner is the person 
who caused the death of Diggs. On the grounds, therefore, that the prisoner was arrested in the first instance on an 
insufficient complaint, and that he is now detained in custody on a warrant of commitment until discharged by due course 
of law for an offence committed in a foreign country; and on the further grounds, that the offence stated in the warrant 
of commitment is not one for which the prisoner is liable to be detained under the provincial act for carrying out the 
treaty with the United States for the surrender of certain fugitive
criminals, and that the evidence, as given before the justice of the peace, is of too vague a character to establish the
 offence of murder against the prisoner according to the laws of this province, I am of opinion that the prisoner is now
 entitled to be discharged from custody.”</p>
        <p>The learned judge concluded his opinion in the following terms:—</p>
        <p>“Can it then be a matter of surprise that the prisoner should endeavour to escape from so degrading a position; or 
rather, would it not be a cause of surprise if the attempt
were not made? Diggs—though he could have had no other interest in it but that which binds slaveholders for their 
common interest to prevent the
<pb id="ander39" n="39"/>
escape of their slaves—interfered to prevent the prisoner getting beyond the bounds of his bondage, and, with his 
slaves, pursued and hunted him with a spirit and determination which might well drive him to desperation; and when at 
length the prisoner appeared within reach of capture, he, with a stick in his hand, crossed over a fence, and advanced 
to intercept and seize him. The prisoner was anxious to escape, and, in order to do so, made every effort to avoid his
 pursuers. Diggs, as their leader, on the contrary, was most anxious to overtake and come in contact with the prisoner,
 for the unholy purpose of rivetting his chains more securely. Could it be expected from any man indulging the desire 
to be free, which nature has implanted in his breast, that he should quietly submit to be returned to bondage and to 
stripes, if by any effort of his strength or any means within his reach, he could emancipate himself? Such an expectation, 
it appears to me, would be most unreasonable; and I must say that, in my judgment, the prisoner was justified in using any 
necessary degree of force to prevent what, to him, must inevitably have proved a most fearful evil. He was committing
 no crime in endeavouring to escape and to better his own condition; and the fact of his being a slave cannot, in my 
humble judgment, make that a crime which would not be so if he were a white man. If in this country any number of 
persons were to pursue a coloured man with an avowed determination to return him into slavery, it cannot, I think, 
be doubted that the man pursued
<pb id="ander40" n="40"/>
would be justified in using, in the same circumstances as the prisoner, the same means of relieving himself from so dreadful a result. Can, then, or must the law of slavery in Missouri be recognized by us to such an extent as to make it murder in Missouri, while it is justifiable in this province to do precisely the same act? I confess that I feel it too repugnant to every sense of religion and every feeling of
justice, to recognize a rule, designated as a <hi rend="italics">law,</hi> passed by the strong for enslaving and tyrannizing over the weak—a law which would not be tolerated a moment, if those who are reduced to the condition of slaves, and deprived of all human rights, were possessed of white instead of black or dark complexions. The Declaration of Independence of the present United States proclaimed to the world, that all men
are born equal and possessed of certain inalienable rights, amongst which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; but the first of these is the only one accorded
to the unfortunate slaves; the others of these inalienable rights are denied, because the white population have found themselves strong enough to deprive the blacks of them. A love of liberty is inherent in the human breast, whatever may be the complexion of the skin. ‘Its taste is grateful, and ever will be so till nature herself shall change.’ And in administering the laws of a British province, I never can
feel bound to recognize as law any enactment which can convert into chattels a very large number of the human race. 
<hi rend="italics">I</hi>
<pb id="ander41" n="41"/>
<hi rend="italics">think that, on every ground, the prisoner is entitled to be discharged.” </hi></p>
        <p>All the judgments were listened to with profound silence; but when Mr. Justice McLean concluded the delivery of his opinion with the words—“I think that, on every ground, the prisoner is entitled to be discharged,” the suppressed feelings of the crowd found vent, and the and the court house was 
rent with acclamations. Those who watched the countenance of Anderson, as each of the judges in turn addressed the court, saw it darkened with sadness or brightened with 
hope, as the opinions given were friendly or adverse. Alas! the 
majority had decided that he must be surrendered. No wonder his eyes filled with tears, and the cloud of anxiety settled upon his brow, for would not the effect of that adverse judgment be to consign him to the hands of a jury of slaveholders? and had it not been publicly asserted that roasting to death, at a slow fire, was fate in reserve for him? One hope remained—the 
Court of Error and Appeal might yet reverse the decision that 
had been given, and establish the inviolability of the right of asylum—the proudest institution of the
British empire.</p>
        <p>The authorities, aware, perhaps, beforehand of the nature of the decision to be given, and fearing an attempt at a rescue,
 had prepared an exhibition of armed force; but this demonstration of power excited derision rather than indignation or 
terror.</p>
        <p>The order made by the court on the termination of
<pb id="ander42" n="42"/>
the judgments, was—“That the said John Anderson be recommitted to the custody of the keeper of the gaol 
of the county of Brant, under which he had been detained, until a warrant should issue, upon the requisition of the 
proper authorities of the United States of America, or of the state of Missouri, for his surrender; or until discharged 
according to law.”</p>
        <p>At the conclusion of the case, the counsel for Anderson intimated his intention of referring the judgment just 
delivered to the Court of Error and Appeal, and the counsel for the crown said that no obstruction would be thrown 
in the way.</p>

        <head>GREAT MEETING OF THE CITIZENS OF TORONTO TO<lb/>
PROTEST AGAINST THE EXTRADITION OF ANDERSON.</head>
        <argument>
          <p>Character of the Meeting.—Resolutions Adopted.—Masterly Speech of
John Scoble, Esq.—Memorial to the Governor-General.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>THE excitement in Toronto, caused by the proceedings in the Court of Queen's Bench on the 20th and 23rd of November, 
was intensified by the decision delivered in the full court on the 15th of December; and, in the evening of the 19th 
of the same month, one of the largest and most enthusiastic meetings ever held in the City took place, over which the 
Mayor presided. St. Andrew's Hall was densely packed, and many hundreds were unable to find entrance. The speakers 
included the leading clergymen, lawyers, and merchants of the city. The state of the public feeling may be
inferred from the fact, that the sentiments expressed by some of the speakers that the rendition of Anderson might result
 in the loss of the province to Great Britain, was
warmly applauded. It will be admitted, therefore, that the proceedings of this meeting deserve to be permanently recorded.</p>
        <pb id="ander44" n="44"/>
        <p>It was moved by the Rev. Principal Willis, seconded by Alderman McMurrich, and RESOLVED,—“That this meeting,
 impressed with the danger to the cause of humanity and liberty which would result from the rendition to the United 
States of the fugitive Anderson, now imprisoned in this city, hold it an imperative duty to give expression to those 
feelings, on this subject, which were implanted in the human breast prior to all legislation, and which has been the 
honour of British law to recognize and vindicate.”</p>
        <p>It was moved by Professor D. Wilson, seconded by the Rev. Dr. Burns, and RESOLVED,—“That, believing 
slavery—a system which dooms human beings to perpetual servitude, treats them as vendible chattels, and places
 the dearest personal rights and domestic ties, even the very prerogatives of conscience, at the mercy of arbitrary 
power—to  be unscriptural, and a violation of the fundamental principles of the law of nature, this meeting holds 
it to be unjust to apply the designation of ‘murder’ to such violence as a fugitive may find necessary,
 to resist aggression, and defend his personal liberty.”</p>
        <p>It was moved by John Scoble, Esq., formerly, and for many years, secretary to the British and Foreign Anti-slavery
 <sic corr="Society">Socety;</sic> seconded by M. C. Cameron, Esq., and RESOLVED,—“That in the opinion 
of this meeting the British Government, in <sic corr="negotiating">negociating</sic> the Ashburton Treaty, could not 
have intended that a fugitive slave escaping from bondage to Canada, and charged with the commission of crime in his 
struggle for freedom, should be returned for trial in the slave states.”</p>
        <pb id="ander45" n="45"/>
        <p>The speech of Mr. Scoble on this occasion, is so important—as a clear and conclusive exposition of the true 
meaning and intent of the extradition clause of the treaty referred to in the Resolution—that we deem it worthy 
a place
in this narrative. Mr. Scoble said:—</p>
        <p>“I understand it is expected from me that I shall give to this meeting a statement of facts with reference to 
the extradition treaty, as we find them in the public records. I well remember that, in the year 1843, when the first 
printed copy of the extradition, or Ashburton treaty with the United <sic corr="States">Sates</sic> was presented to 
the Provincial Parliament, we took the alarm at the probable consequences that might result from it with reference to
 fugitive slaves. I had the honour then of being the secretary of the Anti-Slavery Society of England, and of being 
associated in the Anti-Slavery cause with such men as Clarkson, and Brougham, and Lushington, and Denman, and other
 eminent individuals. And in our associated capacity we felt it to be our duty to submit the question of the effect
 the treaty might have, as it respected the fugitive slaves in Canada, to the consideration of the government. It fell 
to me to make the permanent record of all the transactions that then took place, and having refreshed my memory within 
the last few days, by a reference to those records, I am able to state most distinctly and unequivocally that in our 
communications with Lord Ashburton, with Lord Aberdeen, then the Foreign secretary, and with Sir Charles Metcalfe, 
who was then about returning to Canada as
<pb id="ander46" n="46"/>
Governor-General of this Province, it was most clearly understood that fugitive slaves were to be excepted from the operation of the treaty. (Cheers.) I well remember the agitation of the public mind in England in reference to this
question, for we felt that it was just possible for the slaveholders of the United States to charge crimes upon fugitive slaves in Canada, and to produce a certain amount of evidence in relation to such alleged crimes, which might by a strict interpretation of the treaty, lead the Government here to hand over to the tender mercies of slaveholders the fugitives they might claim. We first approached Lord Ashburton on this subject. We wished to understand from him what was his impression as to the 9th Article, more particularly on its bearing on fugitive slaves. I have here the record of what that distinguished nobleman said. After we had explained to him the precise object we had in view, he replied, ‘That the article in question was no more designed to touch the fugitive slave, than to affect the case of deserters, or parties charged with high treason.<corr sic="missing punctuation">’</corr> (Cheers.) Not satisfied, however, with having appealed to Lord Ashburton, as to his understanding of the treaty, or that particular clause of
it which might be used against the fugitive slave, we presented a memorial to the Earl of Aberdeen, then Foreign Minister, in which we set forth the <hi rend="italics">status</hi> of slaves in the United States, showing to his lordship that it was impossible for a slave to obtain justice at the hands of those who held him in their power, and that the
<pb id="ander47" n="47"/>
laws of the Slave States, in reference to the slave, were of the most sanguinary and atrocious description. 
We shewed that there were not less than seventy offences for which the slave might be punished with death, 
and for which a freeman, if he committed them, could only be fined or imprisoned, or, at the most, placed in
 the Penitentiary. We then pointed out to his lordship the character of the tribunals before which offending
 slaves were tried, and shewed that it was utterly impossible for a slave to look for justice under any circumstances 
that could be imagined from such courts. We concluded our memorial in these words:—‘The committee enter not 
into the discussion of the policy or impolicy of the general principle involved in the extradition clause, they refer
 that to the wisdom of the Government and the Legislature; but they cannot willingly be parties to any arrangement
 which involves the possibility of the restoration of fugitive slaves to bondage, or which renders any part of the 
British dominions less an asylum of liberty than it is at present. They, therefore, earnestly beseech your lordship 
that, in the contemplated Act of Parliament for giving that clause effect, the Government will be pleased to provide
 that it shall not, under any circumstances or under any pretence whatsoever, apply to the case of fugitive slaves, 
but that they shall be wholly exempted from its operation.’ That was the prayer of the committee of the
 Anti-Slavery Society, and it was sustained by the whole of England. Now, what was the answer which Lord Aberdeen gave
 to us?
<pb id="ander48" n="48"/>
‘His lordship received the deputation with great courtesy, and intimated that he took the deepest interest in
 the security and welfare of the fugitive slaves who have sought refuge in Upper Canada. His lordship stated also 
that the greatest care should be taken to prevent, in their case, the abuse of the extradition article.’ 
And from my own recollection I am able to state another fact in connection with that interview; it is this—that
 his lordship stated that, in order to prevent the possibility of the misuse of the 9th clause of the treaty, strict 
instructions should be forwarded to the Governor of Canada that, in the case of fugitive slaves, the greatest care 
should be taken that the treaty should not work the ruin of them.” (Loud cheers.)</p>
        <p>It was moved by the Rev. Mr. Topp, seconded by the Rev. Mr. King, of Buxton, and RESOLVED,—“That as it 
is the boast of Britain that its soil cannot be trodden by a slave, so it is the high distinction of this province 
that it has hitherto afforded an inviolable sanctuary for the oppressed; and, while desiring no immunity to be afforded
 by our law for real criminals, whether bond or free, we feel that the disposal of the pending cause, in the manner to which the decision of the court points, would be to destroy the security which many British subjects now happily enjoy within our territory.”</p>
        <p>It was moved by P. Brown, Esq, seconded by J. G. Bowes, Esq., and RESOLVED,—“That this meeting, while 
reposing well-merited confidence in the equitable spirit of British law, and cherishing becoming respect
<pb id="ander49" n="49"/>
for British tribunals, regard it as entirely consistent with such sentiments to seek, in due order, the most deliberate 
award of justice on a question respecting which our judges are divided in opinion, and resolve to leave nothing undone
 to have the present case submitted to the courts of last resort in the province, and, if need be, in the empire.”</p>
        <p>It was moved by the Rev. F. H. Marling, seconded by Alexander Manning, Esq., and RESOLVED,—“That the following
 petition be forwarded to His Excellency the
Administrator of the Government, praying him to withhold his warrant for the delivery of the fugitive slave, Anderson, to 
the United States authorities for the reasons set forth in the preceding resolutions:—</p>
        <p>“To His Excellency, &amp;c.,—The memorial and petition of the undersigned most respectfully sheweth,—</p>
        <p>“That as inhabitants of this free British province, and warmly attached to the British Constitution, we feel deeply concerned in any event, or act of civil administration, by which the reputation of our country, as one whose soil cannot be polluted with slavery, might be tarnished, or the influence of British laws given directly or indirectly to the upholding of a cruel oppression.</p>
        <p>“That, alarmed by the manner in which the rash, and, as your petitioners believe, improper act of a local authority in Canada, in arresting and detaining, under an alleged charge of murder in the State of Missouri, the person of Anderson, now in jail in Toronto, has 
<pb id="ander50" n="50"/>
been affirmed by a majority of the judges of the Queen's Bench, your petitioners gladly betake themselves to your 
Excellency as the acting head of the Executive Government, in the earnest hope that such a decision may not prevent 
your Excellency from disposing of this case in harmony with the spirit of our laws and the dictates of eternal justice.</p>
        <p>“That your petitioners believe that a just as well as liberal interpretation of the Ashburton Treaty would 
exempt the accused party, Anderson, from the range of its application, and they are strengthened in this belief not 
only by the authority of a Judge of long experience on the Queen's Bench itself, but by the opinions of eminent 
practical lawyers in Canada, and by decisions in analogous cases both in Britain and the United States; also by 
documents, extant and accessible, illustrating the meaning of Lord Ashburton and other parties closely connected 
with the arrangements of said treaty.</p>
        <p>“That were the prisoner in question remanded to a United States jury in the circumstances alleged, and in the
 present state of the slave law, the prisoner's opportunities of obtaining impartial judgment are so small, and so 
diminished beyond all that could have been foreseen by the parties to the Ashburton Treaty— especially since the
 decision in what is known as the Dred Scott case, which affirms that a coloured person has no rights that he can
 assert or which the citizens of the Republic are bound to respect—that his rendition on
<pb id="ander51" n="51"/>
the evidence alleged would be to recognize a state of things never contemplated by those who framed the Treaty. 
And your memorialists submit that where so much as a doubt of the reading of the Treaty exists, the benefit should, 
as usual, but especially where such momentous interests are concerned, be given to the accused; and the case, so 
far as it happily comes for preliminary Judgment before our own Government, should be decided in a large and humane 
construction of the clauses of the Treaty, and the Acts of Parliament bearing upon it, rather than by mere 
technicalities.</p>
        <p>“That the consequences of disposing of this cause otherwise, cannot, your memorialists hope, but appear 
to your Excellency and your Government most dangerous to the sacred interests of just liberty, in rendering the
 condition of many industrious residents in this province one of extreme peril; nothing being easier than, by means 
of such evidence as has been brought forward in this case, to drag them back to bondage, or subject them to the cruel 
pains of a law which gives no equal protection to the slave, whether as regards life, chastity, or religion, and thus 
to render our happily free territory a hunting ground for persons whose crime may only have been that they dared to be
 better than slaves, and defended at the risk of their own lives, or with possible danger to the lives of aggressors 
and spoilers, their inalienable rights and their dearest domestic relations.</p>
        <p>“That reposing confidence in the generous and
<pb id="ander52" n="52"/>
British-like spirit of your Excellency, and in the belief that your memorialists plead only for what is just and right according to the law of nations, the sacred demands of religion, and the true reading of international compacts, they pray your Excellency to release the prisoner aforesaid, and hold him not liable to be rendered up to foreign authorities, as claimed.</p>
        <p>“And your memorialists will ever pray, &amp;c.”</p>
        <p>Such were the proceedings of one of the most numerously attended, enthusiastic, and important meetings ever held in the capital of Western Canada.</p>
        <p>It has been already stated that, at the conclusion of the case in the Court of Queens Bench in Canada, the counsel of Anderson stated his intention to refer the judgment then delivered to the Court of Error and Appeal. Accordingly, on the 22nd of December, an application for leave to make such an appeal was heard by the court, but it was decided that no appeal would lie from its judgment upon a writ of <hi rend="italics">Habeas Corpus</hi> to the court above. Mr. Freeman, the able and zealous counsel for Anderson, then said that it was in contemplation to sue for a writ of <hi rend="italics">Habeas Corpus</hi> from the Court of Common Pleas, and also from the Court of Chancery, and that, if necessary, application would be made to the Legislature of Canada, and, in the last resort, to the Privy Council and Parliament of England.</p>

        <head>PROCEEDINGS IN ENGLAND—SECOND WRIT OF<lb/>HABEAS CORPUS.</head>
        <argument>
          <p>First knowledge of Anderson being a Slave.—Prompt and praiseworthy conduct of the Duke of Newcastle.—Action 
of the Committee of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society.—Memorial to the Colonial 
Minister.—Application to the Court of Queen's Bench, Westminster.—The Lord Chief Justice issues a Writ of <hi rend="italics">Habeas Corpus.</hi>—American Minister's Despatch, describing the state of Anti-Slavery feeling in England.—Agitation throughout the Country.—Language of the Public Journals—<hi rend="italics">Times, Weekly Dispatch, &amp;c.</hi>—Exertions made by the Anti-Slavery Society and its Secretary.— The Writ is sent to Canada.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>LEAVING Anderson in jail in Canada, the attention of the reader is directed to England for the purpose of noticing the 
proceedings taken by the Government, the Press, and the anti-slavery portion of the community, in the novel case 
first made known by the contents of the American mail, at the commencement of the mouth of January, 1861.</p>
        <p>The application made to the Court of Queen's Bench in Canada, and the decision thereon, appear to have furnished 
the earliest information received by the Queen's Government in London, of the fact, that John Anderson, whose 
extradition had been sanctioned, was <hi rend="italics">a slave.</hi> On this fact becoming known at the Colonial
<pb id="ander54" n="54"/>
Office, the Duke of Newcastle addressed a despatch to the officer administering the Government of Canada, dated 
January 9th, 1861, stating that he had just received a report of the judgment delivered in the Court of Queen's 
Bench at Toronto, in the case of Anderson, <hi rend="italics">a fugitive slave;</hi> and, also, information that the 
prisoner's counsel had given notice of appeal. His Grace directed that, “If the result of that appeal should be 
adverse to Anderson, it was to be borne in mind by the acting Governor of Canada that, under the treaty of extradition, 
Anderson could not be delivered over to the authorities of the United States by the mere action of the law, and that he 
could be surrendered only by a warrant under the hand and seal of the Governor.” The Duke further stated, that “the case of Anderson was one of the greatest possible importance, and that Her Majesty's Government were not satisfied that the decision of the Court at Toronto had been in conformity with the view of the treaty which had hitherto guided the authorities in this country. Such being the case, the Government of Canada were to <hi rend="italics">abstain, in any case,</hi> from completing the extradition, until Her Majesty's Government should have had further opportunities of considering the question, and, if necessary, conferring with the Government of the United States on the subject.” In conclusion, the Duke expressed his desire to be kept fully and immediately informed in reference to any further steps which might be taken in a case at once so peculiar and so important.</p>
        <pb id="ander55" n="55"/>
        <p>About the same time, the committee of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery society presented a memorial to the 
Duke of Newcastle, urging him to interpose to prevent the extradition of Anderson, and submitting that the clause in 
the Treaty under which he had been claimed, was not applicable to the case, inasmuch as it provided for the surrender
 of a criminal to justice <hi rend="italics">only upon such evidence of criminality as according to the laws of the place
 where the fugitive so charged shall be found would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial if the crime 
had been there committed.</hi> The question to be decided was, whether, according to British law, a man would be chargeable with the crime of murder, who had resorted to extreme means to preserve the liberty of which another was seeking unjustly to deprive him—<hi rend="italics">which was the case with regard to Anderson.</hi> In addition to this memorial, the committee considered it advisable to take a more decided step than that of simply asking Government to issue instructions to the superior authorities in Canada not to deliver up Anderson without a direct order from Her Majesty's advisers. Accordingly, on the 10th of January, the Duke of Newcastle was notified that a motion would be made on affidavit in the Court of Queen's Bench, Westminster Hall, for a writ of <hi rend="italics">Habeas Corpus</hi> to issue for the production of the person of Anderson in that Court, and on the 15th the motion was made upon the grounds stated in the memorial, and others which were most ably presented; and the writ was granted.</p>

                <head>EX PARTE ANDERSON.</head>
                <p>Mr. EDWIN JAMES, Q.C. (with whom were Mr. Flood and Mr. G. Allan) moved for a writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> to be directed to the Governor of the Province of Canada, to the Sheriff of Toronto, and the keeper of the gaol there, to bring up the body of one John Anderson, together with the cause of his detention.</p>
                <p>Lord Chief Justice COCKBURN asked why the name of the Governor was introduced.</p>
                <p>Mr. JAMES said the reason was because, in the St. Helena case, to which he should have to refer, the name of the Governor
 was introduced, as well as that of the keeper of the gaol. The affidavit on which the learned counsel moved was made by L. A.
Chamerovzow, of No. 27, New  Broad-street , in the city of London, Secretary of the <hi rend="italics">British and Foreign 
Anti-Slavery Society.</hi> He stated that John Anderson, of the city of Toronto, in Her Majesty's Province of Canada, a 
British subject, domiciled there,
was, as he verily believed, illegally detained in the criminal gaol of the said city there, against his will, not having
 been legally accused, or charged with, or legally tried, or sentenced for the commission of any crime, or for any offence
 against or
recognized by the laws in force in the said Province, or in any other part of Her Majesty's dominions, or not being 
otherwise liable to be imprisoned or detained under, or by virtue of any such laws. The affidavit further stated, that
 the deponent verily believed, that unless a peremptory writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> should immediately
 issue by this honourable court, the life of the said John Anderson would be exposed to the greatest and to immediate 
danger. The learned counsel proceeded to observe, that in moving for this writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi>
 the persons for whom he appeared would have to satisfy the court that they
<pb id="ander57" n="57"/>
had jurisdiction to issue this writ to the Province of Canada; and if he established that proposition, their Lordships would have no doubt that, under the pressing circumstances of the case, the writ ought to be directed to issue. The proposition for which he should contend was, that the Crown had power to issue the writ of
<hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> into any part of Her Majesty's possessions. Canada was a part of the possessions of the British crown, and, in the language which had been adopted in these cases, Her Majesty had a right to have an account of the imprisonment of all her subjects in all her dominions. He contended that the court had as much right to
issue this prerogative writ into Canada, as a possession of the British crown, as into the Isle of Wight or Yorkshire. These writs had gone to Calais, when a possession of the British crown, and also to Ireland, and he should contend that Canada stood in
precisely the same position, as a possession of the British crown. Canada, which was a part of the continent of America, was colonized in the reign of James I., and the first charter was granted in the 13th of James I. At that time (and the expression was
material) the whole of that portion of America was called “the Plantations,” and the Board of Trade was called “the Board of Trade and Plantations.” Canada belonged to the British crown till the year 1633, when it was ceded to France; and it was held by the crown of France till the year 1759, when it was retaken, and ceded to the British crown. The statute 14th George III. cap. 83, treated Canada as a colony in the possession of England.</p>
                <p>Lord Chief Justice COCKBURN said that in the Lower Province of Canada the French law prevailed; but Toronto was an English colony in Upper Canada.</p>
                <p>Mr. Justice HILL said the 8th section of the statute the 14th of George III. reserved civil matters for the old law; but, by the 11th section, the criminal law of England prevailed through the whole of Canada.</p>
                <p>Mr. JAMES read an extract from the judgment delivered by Lord Denman in the case of the Canadian prisoners (9 A, and E., 782), where Lord Denman said—</p>
                <p>“The difficult questions that may arise, touching the enforcement in England of foreign laws, are excluded from this case entirely; for Upper Canada is neither a foreign state nor
<pb id="ander58" n="58"/>
a colony with any peculiar customs. Here are no <hi lang="lat" rend="italics">mala prohibita</hi> by virtue of arbitrary enactments; the relation of master and slave is not recognized as legal; but Acts of Parliament have declared that the law of England, and none other, shall there prevail.”</p>
                <p>By the 11th section of the statute the 14th of George III. cap. 34, the criminal law of England was in force through the whole of Canada, and, beyond all question, a British subject in Canada was within a portion of Her Majesty 's dominions. The learned counsel contended that it was matter of right and clear law, that as soon as a country became a portion of Her Majesty's dominions, more especially if, like Canada, it became so by conquest or cession, that the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> issued into it, upon the ground that Her Majesty had a right to know what had become of every one of her subjects. No instance could be found of the writ going into Canada, and therefore it was necessary to rely upon the argument byway of analogy, which empowered the court to issue the writ. That the writ lies and runs into every part of Her Majesty's dominions was laid down in<hi rend="italics"> Bacon's Abridgement</hi>—tit.  <hi rend="italics">Habeas Corpus</hi> (B)—in these terms :</p>
                <p>“2. To what places it may be granted. It hath been already observed that the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> is a prerogative writ, and that, therefore, by the common law it lies to any part of the King's dominions; for the King ought to have an account why any of his subjects are imprisoned, and therefore no answer will satisfy the writ, but to return the cause with <hi lang="lat" rend="italics">paratum habea corpus,</hi> &amp;c. Hence it was holden that the writ lay to Calais at the time it was subject to the King of England.”</p>
                <p>Mr. James then referred to Cowle's case, in the 3rd vol. of <hi rend="italics">Burrows' Reports,</hi> p. 834, where Lord Mansfield said:</p>
                <p>“Writs not ministerially directed (sometimes called prerogative writs, because they are supposed to issue on the part of the King), such as writs of madamus, prohibition,
<hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> certiorari, are restricted by no clause in the constitution given to Berwick: upon a proper case they may issue to every dominion of the Crown of England. There is no doubt of the power of this court where the place is under
the subjection of the Crown of England; the only question is as to the propriety. To foreign dominions which belong to a
<pb id="ander59" n="59"/>
Prince who succeeds to the throne of England this court has no power to send any writ of any kind. We cannot send a 
<hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> to Scotland, or to the Electorate; but to Ireland, the Isle of Man, the Plantations,
 and (as since the loss of the duchy of
Normandy they have been considered as annexed to the Crown in some respects) to Guernsey and Jersey we may, and formerly
 it lay to Calais, which was a conquest, and yielded to the Crown of England by the treaty of Bretigny.”</p>
                <p>Mr. JAMES said, that by the industry of his junior (Mr. Flood), he had copies of the writs which had been issued to 
Calais in 1387 and 1389. They might be seen in <hi rend="italics">Rymer's Fœdera,</hi> p. 15. In 1389 such a writ was issued by the House of Lords, sitting as a court of justice. The learned counsel relied strongly on the authority of Lord Mansfield, who said that the writ would issue to “every dominion of the Crown of England;” and that this court could send the writ to Ireland, to the Isle of Man, and to “the Plantations.” He also referred to <hi rend="italics">Vattel's Law of Nations,</hi> b. 1, chap. 18, p. 210, as an authority for the position, that where a nation took possession of a distant country, and settled in it, it became a part of the parent State; and to <hi lang="lat" rend="italics">Grotius de Jure Belli ac Pacis</hi> b. 2, c. 9. to the same effect. He also referred to <hi rend="italics">Peere's Williams's Reports,</hi> b. 2, pp. 74, 65, where it was said:—</p>
                <p>“Memorandum, the 9th of August, 1722.—It was said by the Master of the Rolls to have been determined by 
the Lords of the Privy Council, upon the appeal to the King in Council from the foreign Plantations, ‘That if there be a new and uninhabited
country found out by British subjects, as the law is the birthright of every subject, so wherever they go they carry 
their laws with them, and therefore such new-found country is to be governed by the laws of England.’”</p>
                <p>Mr. JAMES then referred to the case of “Reg <hi rend="italics">v.</hi> Crawford” (13 Q. B., 613), which 
was an application for a writ of <hi lang="lat" rend="italics">habeas corpus ad subjiciendum</hi> to the Isle of Man,
 and in which it was held that the writ would run into that island since the 5th of
George III., by which the island was vested, in the Crown, and formed part of its dominions. The learned council also 
cited the case of “Campbell <hi rend="italics">v.</hi> Hall,” in <hi rend="italics">Cowper's Reports,</hi> 
p. 204.</p>
                <p>Mr. Justice CROMPTON thought the question was whether the courts in Westminster Hall had now a concurrent jurisdiction 
with the local Courts in granting this writ.</p>
                <pb id="ander60" n="60"/>
                <p>Lord Chief Justice COCKBURN said, that in the Berwick case, Berwick was not subject to the law of Scotland, and therefore there was no superior court which could send a <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> to prevent an illegal imprisonment, unless this Court took upon itself jurisdiction. But was that the case in Canada?</p>
                <p>Mr. JAMES said he did not dispute that Canada had both legislative and criminal jurisdiction; but his argument was, that the courts in England had a concurrent jurisdiction with the Courts in Canada. The present was not the case of a man who
had been tried in Canada, or who was under the sentence of a court which had power to sentence him, for the affidavit shewed that he had never been tried; and he contended that the mere institution of a local jurisdiction would not oust the Queen of the right which she had to ascertain whether any of her subjects were illegally imprisoned. In the case of the Isle of Man, there were local courts which had the power to issue writs of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> and so also in the St. Helena case (“<hi rend="italics">Ex parte</hi> Lees, <hi rend="italics">Ellis, Blackburn, and Ellis,</hi> 28). In this latter case a writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> had been very recently granted, after a writ of error had issued.</p>
                <p>Mr. Justice CROMPTON said he issued the writ as ancillary to the writ of error.</p>
                <p>Mr. JAMES said, that if this court refused a writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> the party had a right to go in succession to each of the superior courts; and if this court should refuse their writ, he would have a right to go to every court in Westminster-hall. He thought that was a strong argument to shew that this court had a concurrent jurisdiction with the Canadian courts.</p>
                <p>Lord Chief Justice COCKBURN said the question was whether it was within the ambit of this court's jurisdiction, or whether the power of granting the writ was not vested by the Crown in another jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>Mr. JAMES contended that the mere establishment of such a jurisdiction in a local court could not limit the rights of the Crown without the authority of an Act of Parliament.</p>
                <p>Lord Chief Justice COCKBURN said that, by the conquest or session of Canada the law of England attached, and this court had the power to issue writs of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> into that country, unless the Crown had either expressly or by implication taken away that power. The question was, whether, by the establishment of a local judicature, and committing to it the duty
<pb id="ander61" n="61"/>
of protecting the subject by issuing writs of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> the Crown had not, by implication, 
taken away the jurisdiction of this court.</p>
                <p>Mr. Justice CROMPTON said the Legislature might do that.</p>
                <p>Mr. JAMES said it was open to a party in this country to apply for the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> 
to any court of co-ordinate jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>Mr. Justice HILL.—And also for a prohibition.</p>
                <p>Mr. JAMES contended it was a common-law right of the subject to go to every tribunal for this writ, and 
<hi lang="lat" rend="italics">à fortiori,</hi> the courts in this country would have a concurrent 
jurisdiction with Colonial courts, unless it was taken away by an Act of
Parliament.</p>
                <p>Lord Chief Justice COCKBURN asked whether the right to go to every one of the courts had not arisen from the Habeas
 Corpus Act?</p>
                <p>Mr. JAMES contended it was by the common law, and all this court was asked to do was, not to interfere with any 
judgment, but to grant a <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> to liberate a man who was in illegal custody. He was 
not in custody under the commitment of any local court which had the power to try him; there was no judgment to set 
aside; but it was shewn to the court that he was detained for no crime cognizable by the law of England. The learned
 counsel then referred to Carus Wilson's case (7 Q. B.,
984), in which the writ had issued in the Isle of Jersey; and then proceeded to argue that the case might arise 
when the courts in Canada might be unable to discharge their duties, as a reason why this Court should still retain
 the power of granting these writs.</p>
                <p>Lord Chief Justice COCKBURN inquired, supposing the writ should go, what means had the Court of enforcing it?</p>
                <p>Mr. JAMES said the Court could enforce the writ by attachment, but it could not be assumed that the Queen's writ 
would not be obeyed. The court would send its own officer to execute the writ. An application had been made to the 
local court for a writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> and refused; and it was now shewn to this court that 
John Anderson, a British subject, was illegally detained in prison, having been guilty of no crime cognizable by the law of England. There were precedents for this application,
and he confidently submitted the mere fact that there were other courts which had a concurrent
<pb id="ander62" n="62"/>
jurisdiction would not deprive the applicant of that protection for which he now prayed the Court.</p>
                <p>The learned counsel then handed in the affidavit upon which he moved, and which was in these terms:</p>
                <p>“IN THE QUEEN'S BENCH.</p>
                <p>“The affidavit of Louis Alexis Chamerovzow, of No. 27, New Broad-street, in the city of London, Secretary of the <hi rend="italics">British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society.</hi></p>
                <p>“I say, 1. That John Anderson, of the city of Toronto, in Her Majesty's Province of Canada, a British subject domiciled there, now is, as I verily believe, illegally detained in the criminal <sic corr="gaol">goal</sic> of the said city there, against his will, not having been legally accused, or charged with, or legally tried, or sentenced for the commission of any crime, or for any offence against, or recognized by the laws in force in the said province, or in any other part of Her Majesty's dominions, or not being otherwise liable to be imprisoned, or detained, under or by virtue of any such laws. </p>
                <p>“I verily believe, that unless a prematory writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> shall immediately issue by this honourable Court, the life of the said John Anderson is exposed to the greatest, and to immediate danger.”</p>
                <p>Their Lordships then retired to consider their decision.</p>
                <p>During their Lordship's absence <sic corr="great interest">greatinterest</sic> was manifested by a large number of the bar, who were present, and their Lordship's return was waited for with the greatest anxiety. After a short absence, their Lordships returned and resumed their seats, and </p>
                <p>Lord Chief Justice COCKBURN said:  We have considered this matter, and the result of our anxious deliberation is, that <hi rend="italics">we are of opinion that the writ ought to issue.</hi> We are, at the same time, sensible of the inconvenience that may result from the exercise of such a jurisdiction. We are quite sensible that it may be felt to be inconsistent with that higher degree of colonial independence, both legislative and judicial, which has happily been carried into effect in modern times. At the same time, in establishing local legislation and local judicial authority, the Legislature has not gone so far as expressly to abrogate any jurisdiction which the courts in Westminster
<pb id="ander63" n="63"/>
Hall might possess with reference to the issuing of a writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> to any of Her 
Majesty's dominions; and we find that the existence of that jurisdiction in these courts has been asserted from the 
earliest times, and exercised down to the latest. We have it upon the authority of my Lord Coke, we have it upon the 
authority of my Lord Mansfield, we have it upon the authority of Mr. Justice Blackstone, and on the authority of 
<hi rend="italics">Bacon's Abridgement</hi>—that these writs have been issued, and are to be issued, into all 
the dominions of the crown of England, wherever a subject of the crown is illegally imprisoned, and kept in custody; 
and not only have we these authorities in the shape of <hi rend="italics">dicta</hi> of most eminent judges and 
afterwards of text writers, but we have the practical application of the doctrine in cases from the earliest period down 
to modern times. The more remarkable cases are the instances in which the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> 
has issued into the Islands of Jersey and Man, and St. Helena: all this being in very modern times.  Finding that upon 
these authorities it has been not only asserted as matters of doctrine, but carried into effect and execution as matter 
of practice; that even where there were local judicatures, and local legislatures, the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas 
corpus</hi> has been issued into these dominions of the crown, we feel that nothing short of legislative enactment,
 depriving the court of such a jurisdiction, would warrant us in omitting to carry it into effect, where we are called 
upon to do so for the protection of the personal liberty of the subject. It may be that the Legislature has thought 
proper, in its wisdom, to leave a concurrent jurisdiction between these courts and the colonial courts, as there has
 been, as very properly pointed out by Mr. James in his argument, between the different courts in Westminster Hall. We can 
only act on the authorities that have been brought before us, and we feel that we should not be doing that which it is our
 duty to do under the authority of the precedents to which our attention has been called, by refusing this writ; 
<hi rend="italics">therefore the writ must go.</hi></p>
                <p>At the conclusion of the judgment there was a very general but suppressed expression of applause, and the countenances 
of all in court seemed lighted up with extreme pleasure at the result.—Writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> 
granted.</p>

        <p>Mr. Dallas, the United States Minister in London, was no unconcerned spectator of the interest manifested in the fate of 
Anderson, as we find from a letter addressed by that gentleman to the Secretary of State at Washington, dated January the 
16th, the day after the issuing of the writ by the Lord Chief Justice. Mr. Dallas, in his despatch, informs the Secretary 
of State that, “The claim made by the United States upon the Government of Canada for the extradition of one, 
Anderson, a fugitive slave, charged with the crime of murder, had awakened, as of course, so much interest in England, 
and invoked so much professional astuteness to defeat the operation of the 10th article of the treaty of 1842, that he 
had thought it expedient to place in possession of the department, all the papers published in England relating
to the subject.” His Excellency then went on to say that “it was scarcely necessary for him to remark on the 
pungent and uncompromising hostility to social bondage, which prevailed throughout this country; that, as it had already 
led to giving by statute to the American slave who deserts his ship, a discriminating immunity over the freeman, so it 
could not be expected to shrink from another manifestation on the
interpretation of an international convention for the mutual surrender of culprits. In truth it might be said, generally, 
that in British opinion, the <hi rend="italics">status</hi> of slavery incapacitated the individual for contract or 
crime.” His Excellency further
called the special attention of the Secretary of State to the fact “that Lord Chief Justice Cockburn
<pb id="ander65" n="65"/>
had, with <hi rend="italics">surprising celerity</hi> allowed a writ of <hi rend="italics">Habeas Corpus,</hi> addressed to the jailer in Canada to issue, and that Anderson would thereupon be brought to England,
notwithstanding the very full and deliberate decision of the Colonial Court ordering him to be delivered up.”</p>
        <p>The excitement throughout Great Britain at this time was universal, and the sympathy in behalf of Anderson, profound and ardent. The question was discussed in all the newspapers, and, with scarcely an exception, the writers were in favour of refusing to the demand of the United States Government, the surrender of the fugitive
who had sought an asylum on British territory, and whose offence was no crime in the eye of British law. The following article which appeared in the <hi rend="italics">Times,</hi>  justly represented the public opinion. After a careful analysis of the facts in the case, as stated in the Canadian Court, it said,—</p>
        <p>“In their hearts and consciences the Canadian authorities must have felt that Anderson slew his enemy in defence of all that man holds dear; they must have 
felt that to surrender him to his pursuers to be burnt alive—a fate probably reserved for him—would be a most dreadful responsibility, and yet, as judges bound to administer the law uprightly, they may have hardly seen how to evade the conclusion. We are not surprised, therefore, to find that they have taken refuge in indecision, and remitted the case successively from one court to another. First the magistrates gave up the attempt, and referred the matter to the Attorney-General; 
<pb id="ander66" n="66"/>
then the Attorney-General, after two months' consideration, alleged his incompetence; and now the Court of Queen's 
Bench has cognizance of the question,
by which tribunal it must be finally decided. Before this time, indeed, judgment has doubtless been given, though on 
which side it would be hard to conjecture.</p>
        <p>“We suppose there will be hardly a man in England who will not hope for the success even of his forcible rescue 
if things come to that extremity. The fate, probably, in store, at this crisis of Southern fanaticism, for a slave who 
not only ran away but killed the white planter who attempted to arrest him, is too shocking to think of, and yet the 
Missouri agents may establish their case. The truth is, that such complications must for ever be 
contingent upon institutions like that of slavery. Wherever an institution is at variance in its very essence with the 
moral instincts of our nature, the antagonism thus created will pervade every question concerning it. All except 
slaveholders will judge this case by feelings which they will place above the law.
They may not carry their convictions to the length of breaking the law, but in their hearts they will condemn it, and will
 sympathize with the offender. This is a conflict of laws, which can never be terminated by any political compromise or 
legal adjustment. It must prevail as long as slavery prevails, for slavery cannot prevail without enactments against 
which humanity rebels. Nature and law are therefore forced into 
collision, and under such conditions no peace can be reasonably expected.”</p>
        <pb id="ander67" n="67"/>
        <p>In a subsequent article the same journal remarked,—</p>
        <p>“But are we, therefore, to surrender this man to the cruel fate which awaits him in the neighbouring 
State? The suggestion is preposterous. That we, who look with such scorn upon the little State of Saxony for 
delivering up a Hungarian nobleman who had trusted to her hospitality, should, in our strength and our grandeur, 
deliver up a wretched slave who had run for our soil as to the ark of freedom, 
may be argued as logical necessity in a court of law, but is an obvious impossibility as a fact. 
How it will be we do not pretend to foretell. How the logical necessity will be shown to be a practical impossibility, 
we are by no means prepared to explain; but very confident we are that this negro is at this moment as safe, in the 
prison of Toronto, from ever being sent before a Missouri jury of slave owners as he would be if he were in the wilds 
of Central Africa. Meanwhile, as we gather from the report, 
there is no immediate hurry, or any danger of any steps being taken to carry out the judgment. 
From the decision of the Queen's Bench, there is, it appears, 
by the Canadian Law, an appeal to the Bench of Judges, and thence again, there is an appeal, as we understand, to 
the Privy Council in England. Although we may fear that upon the broad question of law, the decision of English 
lawyers must concur with that of the Queen's Bench of Canada; and although the ingenuity of counsel and of anxious 
judges may fail to discover any technical objection which may vitiate the proceedings, yet time will be 
<pb id="ander68" n="68"/>
afforded for the intervention of diplomacy, within the province of which a difficulty of this character specially falls. It is not because we have heedlessly gone into an
engagement which involves an unsuspected obligation to burn an innocent man, that we are therefore to burn him. It is not because we have blindly and unknowingly bound ourselves systematically to outrage all the common laws of God and humanity, that we are therefore now, as a matter of course, to do the first act and to take the first step by the same means as the Romans used to adopt when they desired to commit themselves to some nefarious enterprise—by the sacrifice of a slave. 
As a topic of transatlantic excitement, this slave case may have its interest, 
but on this side of the Atlantic we are too profoundly convinced of the unpractical character of the contest to be very anxious about it.”</p>
        <p>The following appeared in the <hi rend="italics">Weekly Dispatch</hi>:—“Can any man think it possible that the English nation would submit to the rendition of Anderson? Suppose the
man had escaped to London instead of Toronto; suppose the British Cabinet had been called upon to adjudicate in the matter. How long would they have waited? And even
though they might think the case technically within the treaty, can any one for a moment doubt their decision? With America, above all other people, Great Britain desires to remain at peace; but treaty or no treaty, ‘there he is, touch him if you dare,’ would have been, if necessary, the reply to the infamous demand. No English minister, as he loves the honour
<pb id="ander69" n="69"/>
of his country, as he would be saved from universal execration, hatred, and contempt, could surrender a fugitive slave, guilty of no other crime than that of winning his liberty by the death of his oppressor.”</p>
        <p>It is justly due to the committee of the British and Foreign and Anti-Slavery Society, and more especially to the able secretary of that society, Mr. Lewis Alexis Chamerovzow, who laboured with indefatigable zeal in the cause of Anderson, and to whom the credit belongs of preparing the various documents put forth from time to time by the society, to record the measures which were adopted by that body, and to give insertion to the more important of their manifestoes.</p>
        <p>The first notice of the case appeared in the <hi rend="italics">Anti-Slavery Reporter</hi> of January, 1861, under the head of “Fugitive Slave Extradition Case.” The article contained the leading particulars connected with the encounter between Anderson and the slaveholder Diggs, and quoted the following from the Toronto <hi rend="italics">Globe:</hi>—</p>
        <p>“The Ashburton Treaty was not an agreement between Canada and the State of Missouri, but between Great Britain and the United States, and is not to be interpreted by statutes either imperial or provincial, but by the law of nations. <milestone n="* * * " unit="typography"/> The law of arrest in Missouri is not the law of the Union, but the law of the State, or the law of a municipality within the Union. <milestone n="* * * " unit="typography"/> The Government of Canada in submitting the matter to the law courts, acted unwisely.
<pb id="ander70" n="70"/>
It should have decided for itself whether or not the case came within the meaning of the treaty.”</p>
        <p>The committee took early steps to bring the case under the notice of the friends of the anti-slavery cause throughout Great Britain, and moved them to address earnest memorials to the Duke of Newcastle, praying him to interpose to prevent the extradition of John Anderson from being carried into effect. Their appeal met with an encouraging response. The committee themselves, as we have already stated, addressed a memorial to his Grace, “earnestly, but respectfully beseeching him to interpose his influence and authority, not only to save a fellow creature from a fate horrible to contemplate, but to preserve inviolate those fundamental principles of justice and humanity, which are the foundation of all law—  and those personal rights guaranteed by the British Constitution to every man, whatever his colour, who is unconvicted of crime.”</p>
        <p>“The committee feel (says the memorial) that the issue of this most painful case involves consequences most important to the safety of the fugitives from slavery who have already found an asylum in Canada—some forty thousand in number—and also their unhappy kindred who may attempt to seek refuge and protection there. If the interpretation put upon the particular clause of the Ashburton Treaty, under which Anderson is claimed, be admitted, there is not a refugee from slavery now in
Canada, who under one pretext or other may not be claimed and remanded into slavery.”</p>
        <pb id="ander71" n="71"/>
        <p>In addition to this memorial, the committee, as we have shown, notified the Duke of Newcastle on the 10th of January, that a motion would be made in the Court of Queen's Bench for a writ of <hi rend="italics">Habeas Corpus</hi> to issue to those having the custody of the person of Anderson, requiring them to produce him in Court.</p>
        <p>The following are the comments of the <hi rend="italics">Reporter</hi> upon the proceedings in the Court of Queen's Bench.</p>
        <p>“Our readers will gather from a perusal of our columns, the exact position in which the case of the fugitive slave, John Anderson, at present stands. The warrant under the <hi rend="italics">Habeas Corpus</hi> has been handed over for service to the solicitor, Mr. W. A. Dean, engaged by the committee of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society to conduct the case. It has been forwarded, in duplicate, to the Society's correspondent at Toronto, who will duly execute it. As soon as possible,—for the writ is imperative— Anderson will be brought to England, and produced on the floor of the Court of Queen's Bench, when a return to the writ will be made in due form. The Court will then consider, upon the motion of counsel, whether Anderson is legally detained; and hereupon will be raised the great question which the demand for his extradition involves, namely, whether, under any circumstances whatsoever, a slave who has
sought an asylum on British soil can be surrendered. We are, of course, most anxious for the liberation of Anderson, but we must not forget, that upon the issue of this case
hang the liberty and the life of many thousands
<pb id="ander72" n="72"/>
of British subjects—refugee slaves in Canada—and that even were the Ashburton Treaty held to be protective of the person of refugees from slavery there, we should not feel satisfied unless the great principle were established that no slave will ever be surrendered who has once touched British soil. We believe the judges who decided in
favour of Anderson's rendition to have been utterly in the wrong, for their decision is rendered, in the very teeth of the letter, not to say the spirit, of the treaty, and of the
statutes confirming it. But if they are right, our remedy is a very simple one, for we have but to signify to the government of the dis-United States that we desire the
treaty to cease in its operation, and no more fugitives nor criminals can be claimed for extradition under it. It will be seen, therefore, that we have a much loftier object in view than to secure a mere equitable interpretation of this instrument.</p>
        <p>“The question which will be raised as to the nature of the crime with which he is charged, will at once lead to an investigation of the circumstances under which it was
committed. It will be found impossible to disconnect them from a consideration of his condition at the time, and we hold that no straining of the letter of the law can justify the surrender of a man, who in his condition as a slave, has been deprived of all the rights of citizenship, and therefore stands absolved from all the responsibilities of a citizen.</p>
        <p>“Some time is likely to elapse before Anderson reaches
<pb id="ander73" n="73"/>
this country. We shall have the opportunity, therefore, of again and again addressing our readers upon this subject, and shall submit to them certain points which have
suggested themselves to us in the course of our study of this most remarkable and interesting case.</p>
        <p>“Meanwhile we must not lose this opportunity of dwelling for a moment upon the zeal and ability displayed in conducting this case by Mr. Edwin James, Q.C., M.P., and his coadjutors, Messrs. F. S. Flood, and J. G. Allan. The thanks of the friends of humanity are fairly due to these gentlemen, and especially to Mr. F. Solly Flood, whose profound researches after precedents applicable to this instance, as illustrated in the case he conducted of the Queen <hi rend="italics">v.</hi> Lees, were most generously and handsomely admitted by Mr. James to have been of the greatest value to him, and were, in fact, the grounds upon which the court declared that a writ of <hi rend="italics">Habeas Corpus</hi> could issue to Canada. Mr. Flood is a learned antiquarian lawyer, is quite familiar with the laws of the Slave States, and, from a long residence in America, is equally familiar also with the legal history of inter-State extradition cases; Anderson is,
therefore, likely to have the benefit of the best advice.</p>
        <p>“To obtain the declaration of the great principle to which we have adverted is the more important, because it is erroneously supposed that it was established in the case of the slave, Somersett. Lord Mansfield, however, only declared that the slave was free who came into
<pb id="ander74" n="74"/>
this country, not that a slave could never be given up. The Scotch Courts, on the contrary, asserted the broader principle; and it is to obtain the admission of this principle as a basis of legislation in similar cases, we are now anxious that our anti-slavery friends should turn their  attention.”</p>
        <p>The writ, issued by the Court of Queen's Bench, was dispatched by the first Canadian mail, and, by the same means a letter from Lord John Russell to the Government of Canada, instructing the acting Governor “To facilitate the action of any officer of the Court of Queen's Bench at Westminster sent to bring the prisoner Anderson to England.” This despatch was crossed on its way to Canada by a mail bringing from Sir W. Williams, acting Governor, a reply, dated January 26th, to the Duke of Newcastle's despatch of the 9th of January,—“Being fully impressed (says Sir W. Williams) with the importance and gravity of the case, I had made up my mind to take no step in the matter without the express direction of Her Majesty's Government; and I shall not fail to follow closely your Grace's instructions.”</p>

        <head>PROCEEDINGS IN CANADA—THIRD WRIT OF HABEAS <lb/>CORPUS—DISCHARGE OF ANDERSON.</head>
        <argument>
          <p>Writ granted by the Court of Common Pleas, Canada.—The Case argued, February 1st.; Judgment delivered, February 16th.—Opinion of Mr. Justice Draper.—Comments on the termination of the Struggle.—Course taken by the Canadian Press.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>WE again return to Canada to perform the grateful duty of recording the proceedings which led to the discharge of the fugitive slave after more than eight months'
confinement in jail.</p>
        <p>On the 1<hi rend="italics">st of February,</hi> 1861, a <hi rend="italics">new writ of Habeas Corpus</hi> was granted by Chief Justice Draper, of the Court of Common Pleas in Canada, addressed to the sheriff and
keeper of the jail of the County of Brant, returnable on the 8th of the same month. On the 9th, Anderson was produced in court, and arguments at great length were
heard on his behalf. It was urged,—</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">First.</hi> That the prisoner was entitled to the writ on which he was brought before the Court, and, upon the return to that writ, to have inquired into the matters charged against him. <hi rend="italics">Second.</hi> That <hi rend="italics">the evidence was not sufficient</hi> to put him upon his trial for the crime of
<pb id="ander76" n="76"/>
MURDER; assuming that he was entitled to the protection of British law. <hi rend="italics">Third.</hi> That the treaty requires that <hi rend="italics">a charge under it should be first laid in the States,</hi> and that the
evidence did not show that any charge had been laid against the prisoner. <hi rend="italics">Fourth.</hi> That even if we are bound to administer this law of Missouri, <hi rend="italics">the evidence did not shew that this State of Missouri had any power to pass such a law,</hi> and it cannot be presumed that she had that power, inasmuch as she <hi rend="italics">is but a municipality in relation to other Governments,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">the law is against natural justice. Fifth. </hi>That the word “<hi rend="italics">murder,</hi>” mentioned in the treaty, <hi rend="italics">means murder according to the laws of both countries;</hi> and, if not, that by the treaty itself, and our statute, <hi rend="italics">the crime charged is to be determined by the laws of Canada</hi>—that is, the criminalty is to be determined by the laws of Canada. </p>
        <p>After hearing the evidence, Chief Justice Draper said, “that the Court desired to dispose of this case as quickly as possible, so that Anderson might not be kept in custody any longer than was necessary, if the decision went in his favour; but it was questionable whether, if judgment was to be given on all the points involved, the case could be decided during the present term. At all events they would give the prisoner the benefit of a speedy discharge if they came to an opinion in his favour on the technical point <hi rend="italics">as to the insufficiency of the commitment.</hi> On this question they would probably be able to give a decision that day week, the last day of term. An order would be made for the prisoner
<pb id="ander77" n="77"/>
to be brought up next Saturday, February 16th, and in the meantime he would be committed to the custody of the sheriffs of the united counties of York and Peel.”</p>
        <p>On Saturday, the 16th of February, the Court of Common Pleas, as was generally anticipated, <hi rend="italics">discharged Anderson, on the ground</hi> THAT THE WARRANT OF
COMMITMENT WAS NOT ISSUED IN CONFORMITY WITH THE STATUTE,
because—1<hi rend="italics">st.</hi> It did not contain a charge of murder, but merely of felonious homicide; whereas neither the treaty nor the statute either authorize a surrender, or a committal for the purpose of surrender, for any homicide <hi rend="italics">not expressed to be murder. 2nd. </hi>That the warrant was not expressed to be “for the purpose of surrender,” but only until the prisoner should be discharged by due course of law, whereas the
statute requires <hi rend="italics">both.</hi> Upon <hi rend="italics">the merits of the question</hi> itself <hi rend="italics">no judgment was given.</hi></p>
        <p>The following extract from Chief Justice Draper's judgment will show what he thought of the case:—“I have, so far as the limited time and the pressure of the business during the week would permit, considered some of the questions involved. I have at least been able to appreciate the difficulty of disposing of them. One doubt arises on the threshold, namely, whether the statute gives the Court power to look into the depositions and to adjudge whether they contain evidence of criminality sufficient to sustain the charge of murder. It is easy to suggest objections to the placing the power of exclusive and final adjudication on this point in the
<pb id="ander78" n="78"/>
hands of a single Justice, even although his decision is not binding on the Government, to whom he must certify the same, and the evidence, and on whom rests the ultimate responsibility of surrendering or refusing to surrender the prisoner. Still, however weighty I might deem such objections, if the statute does confer that jurisdiction on a single judge or justice of the peace, the statute must be obeyed. And I am free to confess that there is some difficulty in affirming that this Court can review the decision of the judge or justice without running counter to the opinion expressed in <hi rend="italics">ex parte</hi> Besset. But conceding that we have that province, and as a necessary incident to it to bring the depositions before us by <hi lang="lat" rend="italics">certiorari</hi> (as to which some technical objections may be suggested), I require further time before I can adopt as a principle of the law, that because a man is a slave in a country where slavery is legalized, he is legally incapable of committing a crime, that he is not to be
deemed a “prisoner” who may be charged with an offence. Nor am I prepared to decide that on a charge of murder, sufficiently sustained by evidence to warrant his being committed for trial according to our law, the prisoner accused of that crime would not be within the meaning of the treaty, because, if acquitted on a trial in the country where the accusation arose, he would be detained in bondage as a slave, or because it might be feared, and even with reason feared, that because he was a slave he would not be treated in the same spirit of justice and impartiality as
<pb id="ander79" n="79"/>
a freeman before the tribunals of a foreign State where slavery is established by local law. Or, take a possible case to arise in a Free State, let it be supposed that a slave flies from a Slave State into a Free State, whose laws, nevertheless, unlike our own happy institutions, sanction and require his surrender merely as a slave— that the fugitive kills an officer of the Free State who is endeavouring, under regular process, to arrest and detain him with a view to his surrender, and, having killed the officer, escapes into this province, I do not yet see any way to the conclusion that we could hold the case not to be within the treaty, and the act so clearly not to be murder, that there would be nothing for a jury to try, but that the Court could dispose of it as a pure question of law. For if there be a question of fact to be tried, I apprehend he must be surrendered, as such question could only be tried in the country where the fact arose. These and other similar questions are of too serious a character to be decided upon impulse, or in haste, and I do not scruple to say that, so long as the prisoner sustains no prejudice by the delay, I desire to defer pronouncing an opinion upon them. I am reluctant on the one hand where the accuser does not make it indispensable to declare that each individual of the assumed number of 4,000,000 of
slaves in the Southern States may commit assassination in aid of his escape on any part of his route to this province, and find impunity and shelter on his arrival here. I am reluctant, on the other hand, to admit that Great Britain has entered into
<pb id="ander80" n="80"/>
treaty obligations to surrender a fugitive slave who, as his sole means of obtaining liberty, has shed the blood of the merciless taskmaster who held him in bondage. An occasion may arise when it will be my duty to adjudge one way or the other. But the necessity does not exist at present, and I am not afraid to avow that I rejoice at it. I am, however, glad that the discussion has taken place, that the doubts and difficulties it suggests have been brought prominently forward. The power of dealing with them is in the hands of others, and the necessity of dealing with them must, I think, be felt by those who possess the power.”</p>
        <p>We conclude this part of our narrative with the following article from the Toronto <hi rend="italics">Globe,</hi> a paper to which the cause of justice and liberty is deeply indebted.</p>
        <p>“On Saturday, February 16th, at noon, Anderson was brought before the judges of the Common Pleas, and discharged from custody on the ground of informality in the warrant on which he was committed to Brantford Jail. We publish elsewhere a full report of the decisions of the judges, from which it will be seen that the discharge has
been ordered on two distinct grounds. <hi rend="italics">First. </hi>The warrant of commitment recites that Anderson stands charged for that he did ‘Wilfully, maliciously, and feloniously, stab and kill one Seneca T. P. Diggs, of Howard County,’ which might only amount to manslaughter; whereas the judges decide, that to come within the provisions of the treaty, the charge must be one of ‘murder.’ <hi rend="italics">Second.</hi> The warrant commits
<pb id="ander81" n="81"/>
Anderson to the jail of Brantford ‘Until he shall be discharged according to law;’ whereas, the judges decide, he should have been committed ‘<hi rend="italics">Until surrender he made,</hi> or until he shall be discharged according to law.’</p>
        <p>“We heartily congratulate the people of Canada on the narrow escape we have thus made from what would have been a deep and indelible stain on the fair fame of our
country. For ourselves, we deeply regret that Anderson's discharge has not been ordered on broader and nobler grounds; but at least we can all heartily rejoice that the
poor fugitive to our shores, who dared to strike a freeman's blow for liberty, will not be surrendered by Canadian hands to be burnt at the stake by exulting traffickers in human blood!</p>
        <p>“Anderson is now among his friends; but he is still liable to re-arrest on documents prepared more carefully than the last. The danger, however, is by no means what it was. It is to be hoped that no second Mathews is to be found in the magistracy of Canada, and if, unhappily, there was another such, good care will, we fancy, be taken that Anderson shall not be found until the intent and meaning of the Extradition Treaty in regard to slaves has been authoritatively determined.</p>
        <p>“By the discharge of Anderson, the writ of <hi rend="italics">Habeas Corpus,</hi> issued by the Court of Queen's Bench of England, has been rendered unnecessary and inoperative. Anderson is no longer in the custody of any of the parties to whom the writ was directed, and therefore
<pb id="ander82" n="82"/>
they cannot carry him to England. Moreover, the parties who applied for the intervention of the English Court have obtained the immediate end they sought, by the discharge of the prisoner. We confess that we are glad that this is so. We entirely sympathise with the feeling which induced the application for, and the granting of the writ. The peculiarity of this case of Anderson would have justified a great stretch of authority that tended to save the unfortunate man from the vengeance of his enemies; but it would be neither convenient nor consistent with the independence of the Canadian people that English judges should have the power to ignore our courts, and issue their writs to our sheriffs and jailers as if we had no provincial judges. We presume the legality of the proceeding in the view of an English lawyer is not doubtful, but assuredly it is not in harmony with the right of self-government claimed by Canada, and fully conceded to her.</p>
        <p>“All the proceedings connected with Anderson's case show clearly that there is an urgent necessity not only for an immediate explanation between the British and American Governments as to the applicability of the Extradition Treaty to fugitives from slavery, but also for a revisal of the Canadian statutes giving effect to the treaty. It will be seen from Chief Justice Draper's decision, that a doubt is expressed whether the Court has any power to look into the depositions on which a prisoner is demanded under the treaty—whether it has any authority at all to examine the evidence so as to
<pb id="ander83" n="83"/>
judge if it sustain the charge preferred? It is unnecessary to argue whether Mr. Draper is right or wrong in this view; if a doubt exists on such a point it should be settled at
once. Not one of the thousands of fugitives who have sought refuge in our country would be safe for a week were this affirmed to be the law. The slave hunter would be
on the track of his victims, and affidavits of murder, perjury, arson, or anything else, concocted by the hundred, the moment it was ascertained that the facts alleged could not be enquired into, but the oath of the slave catcher held as final. We trust the friends of freedom in Great Britain will press this matter at once on the attention of the Home Government. The amendment of the Canadian statute will unquestionably be demanded immediately on the assembling of Parliament.</p>
        <p>“Apart from the great principles at stake in this case, we confess to a feeling of no ordinary gratification at the manner in which it has terminated. But for the firm and prompt intervention of the press, it is certain that Anderson would have been given up to the slaveholders, and Canada disgraced for ever. We can afford now to recall
with contempt the abuse poured upon us, because, forsooth, we dared to call in question the propriety of Chief Justice Robinson's decision. The course we took has not only been thoroughly sustained by public opinion in our own country and in Great Britain, but the continued discussion of the case has secured Anderson's discharge by Chief Justice Robinson's
<pb id="ander84" n="84"/>
brother judges. Nay, the very case—the Besset case—on which Mr. Draper mainly rests his decision was first brought into the discussion through the columns of the
<hi rend="italics">Globe.</hi>”</p>
        <p>Canada is not sufficiently removed from the United States to be free from that vile, unchristian prejudice against colour which is the reproach and crime of the majority of the people of the American Republic, and, consequently, there was to be found a paper in Toronto base enough to prostitute its columns to the work of <sic corr="vilifying">villifying</sic> the Negro race, and of resisting their claims to the rights which the laws of Canada guarantee to all who seek a dwelling under their protection. This paper had its supporters or it could not have existed. Its patrons, we are compelled to believe, were in favour of the rendition of Anderson, but the people in their masses demanded his release, as did also the larger portion of the more elevated classes, who heartily wished success to the means employed for his deliverance from the meshes his enemies had cast around him.</p>

        <head>JOHN ANDERSON IN ENGLAND.</head>
        <argument>
          <p>Anderson leaves Canada for England.—Arrives in London.—Great reception meeting at Exeter Hall.—Speeches of Mr. Harper Twelvetrees; the Rev. Hugh Allen, D.D.; the Rev. Jabez Burns, D.D.; the Rev. W. H. Bonner; John Anderson; the Rev. T. M. Kinnaird; the Rev. J. G. Hewlett, D.D.; Mr. William Craft; the
Rev. Edward Mathews, &amp;c.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>There were many friends of John Anderson in Canada who would have been happy to have promoted his future interests in that country, if he had been disposed to
continue there; but he felt a strong inclination to visit England. He was not free from an apprehension of being again annoyed by proceedings for his extradition, for well
he knew the perseverance and implacability of his enemies, and how ready to forward their designs were numerous base persons both in Upper and Lower Canada. In England, he would not only be free but secure, and might enjoy his liberty without the fear of persecution, and the ultimate loss of the blessing he had for the present
obtained.</p>
        <p>During the three months following his liberation, he received from the friends of freedom in Toronto and Montreal the utmost possible kindness. Bidding them
<pb id="ander86" n="86"/>
farewell, with a grateful heart he sailed for Liverpool, where he arrived in the middle of June, and after a short stay, and hospitable treatment there, started for London.
Soon after his arrival in the Metropolis, he was introduced to a number of friends of the anti-slavery cause, who deemed his advent upon our shores a proper occasion for
the holding of a great meeting, of which the following report appeared in the public journals:—</p>
        <q direct="unspecified">

                <head>MEETING OF WELCOME.</head>
                <p>On Tuesday evening, July 2nd, one of the largest and most enthusiastic public meetings ever held in the Metropolis assembled in Exeter Hall for the purpose of
expressing its sympathy with JOHN ANDERSON, the fugitive slave, and of offering him a cordial welcome on his arrival in England. Mr. HARPER TWELVETREES, of
Eversley House, Bromley-by-Bow, occupied the chair; and amongst the gentlemen on the platform, were the Rev. Hugh Allen, D.D.; the Rev. Jabez Burns, D.D.; the Rev. J. G. Hewlett, D.D.; the Rev. W. H. Bonner; the Rev. W. A. Blake; the Rev. G. W. McCree; the Rev. T. J. Messer; the Rev. G. Berkeley, of Jersey; the Rev. E. Mathews; the Rev. John Sidney Hall; the Rev. P. Pocock; the Rev. Thomas Jones; the Rev. T. M. Kinnaird, (a coloured Clergyman); the Rev. G. T. Horne; Henry Hanks, Esq.; E. Burr, Esq.; William Farmer, Esq.; Thomas Hattersley, Esq.; Cooke Baines, Esq.; Joseph A. Horner, Esq.; F. L. H. Collins, Esq.; Colonel Raines; T. R. Kemp, Esq.; William
<pb id="ander87" n="87"/>
Craft, Esq.; Robert Rae, Esq.; A. W. Sanderson, Esq.; General Riley; and a considerable number of members of the Anti-Slavery Associations.</p>
                <p>Upon John Anderson's appearance on the platform, leaning on the arm of Mr. Twelvetrees, he was received with loud and prolonged cheering, accompanied by
waving of hats and handkerchiefs, and other demonstrations of enthusiasm, which he repeatedly acknowledged by bowing.</p>
                <p>The proceedings having been opened by a brief but appropriate prayer, by the Rev. Dr. HEWLETT,</p>
                <p>COOKE BAINES, ESQ., one of the Hon. Secretaries, informed the meeting that letters had been received from several influential persons, regretting their inability to
attend. Amongst these were the Right Hon. the Earl of Shaftesbury, H. B. Sheridan, Esq., M.P., T. S. Duncombe, Esq., M.P., George Thompson, Esq., the Rev. C. H.
Spurgeon, &amp;c., &amp;c. Lord Shaftesbury stated that he was unable to preside at the meeting as requested, but added, “I desire to express the warmest interest in the case of John Anderson, and will be happy to contribute to any fund that may be raised on his behalf.” Mr. Sheridan said that “he deeply sympathised with the much ill-used man, Anderson, and trusted that means would be taken to place him in a position to earn his living in this country, believing that he would show by his conduct, that a slave was capable of becoming as good a citizen as a man of another colour.”
Mr. Duncombe “could not be present at the meeting on account
<pb id="ander88" n="88"/>
of a promise to attend the debate in the House of Commons on the affairs of Poland, but he wished it to be understood that he warmly sympathised with the object which they were met to promote.” Mr. George Thompson was absent in the North of England, but he had expressed his willingness to do all in his power to assist John
Anderson. The Rev. C. H. Spurgeon had taken a lively interest in John Anderson, and would have been present that evening if he could possibly have attended. Mr.
Baines proceeded to state, that “Anderson was very desirous, as were also the members of the committee, that his wife and children, who were at present in slavery, should be in this land of freedom with him. (Cheers.) The object of the meeting that evening, therefore, was to enable him to get his wife and children over as soon as possible, and he (Mr. Baines) hoped that every man and every woman would leave the hall with a sincere determination of doing all in their power to assist him in accomplishing that object.” (Applause.)</p>
                <p>The CHAIRMAN, who was enthusiastically received, said it had become customary, he believed, for those who occupied the chair at Exeter Hall to apologise for doing so, and to express regret on account of their inability to discharge the duties of their office worthily. But, although he was as conscious of his shortcomings as any of those noblemen or gentlemen who had preceded him in the occupancy of that chair, he would not weary the meeting with vain regrets, but merely say that he accepted the invitation to preside with timidity, mingled
<pb id="ander89" n="89"/>
with considerable pleasure, (Hear, hear) because he felt assured that he might rely on the kind consideration, sympathy, and forbearance of an Exeter Hall audience, assembled for a philanthropic object—not for any political or factious purpose, not for the purpose of expressing an opinion respecting the present crisis in America, nor to discuss the policy of the North or South. They had met there that night, as he understood, to do honour to their principles as philanthropists and christians—to express their earnest and unswerving belief in the great truth which spans like a rainbow the whole heavens of humanity—“God hath made of one blood all nations of men”—to assert their determination to recognise man as man all the world over, and to proclaim to the world that as Englishmen they have no sympathy with those who barbarise, oppress, and ill-treat humanity. They purposed also to render some
practical assistance, as well as to give an enthusiastic welcome to a Brother— who, hunted as a fugitive, had just finished a desperate struggle for liberty, that sweetest boon of Heaven; and having narrowly escaped the baying of the bloodhounds and the tortures of death by fire, had come while still panting with his run for life, to seek an asylum in our country—in this our happy England— with its free soil, free institutions, and free speech—(Great applause) where the bruised, the burdened, and oppressed of every name and nation are beyond the reach of tyrants' arms—where colour is no crime—but where human rights are sacred, and freedom, liberty, and justice are secured to all who tread
<pb id="ander90" n="90"/>
our shores. (Loud cheers.) In his few opening remarks, he did not intend to dwell upon the personal history of the pitiable and trembling fugitive before them, but would leave that duty to some of the gentlemen who had consented to take part in the Meeting. He confessed, however, to a wish that Anderson could tell the story of
his life upon every hearthstone in the Kingdom, for he felt assured that every husband, wife, and child would listen with strange and tearful earnestness while he told them of the loved ones whom he had left in sorrow and bondage, with no acknowledged rights; and who, though owned by God, were yet owned and bound and scarred by man, and might be mangled and butchered at the will of their owner.
(Sensation and cheers.) He trusted the meeting would allow him a few moments' licence whilst he drew their attention to the strange anomaly, that a country like
America—known as a Christian country—a country which had subscribed to the immortal Declaration of Independence—a country which is boasted of as “the
land of the brave and the home of the free,” should yet be steeped in the diabolical and accursed sin of slavery. The American people, he remarked, would listen with eagerness and interest to the wrongs endured by distant nations; but the ears of human sympathy were doggedly closed to the piteous cries and bitter wailings of the slave. (Cheers). The fugitive slave had no home in that great Republic, and was not even allowed to pass peaceably through the Free States to find a home in a more favoured country, where,
<pb id="ander91" n="91"/>
under the sway of our own emancipating Queen, he might find equal rights and privileges, and enjoy the immunities of nationality and freedom. (Loud cheers.) Did
they ask, how it was that although the soil of America had been cultivated for centuries by slaves, they should themselves be strangers and foreigners—aliens in their native land—and despisedly placed beyond the pale of both secular and religious authority? The secret was to be found in “the Bond” of the Federal Union, which was “ordained to establish justice, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity;” for there, among great swelling words of liberty, it was recorded that there was not an inch of ground within the limits of the great American Republic which was not mortgaged to Slavery! (Cries of “Shame” and Applause). That anomalous instrument clearly establishes the fact that there was not a foot of soil in that Republic which does not bear the bloody endorsement in favour of slavery, for “the Bond” provides that the slave-hunter and his blood-hounds may seize his trembling victim on the holiest spot of this “land of the free!” (Loud cheers.) No wonder then that from the judicial seat of that mighty Government came the shameful, disgraceful, wicked, and diabolical decision that “no person along whose veins coursed one drop of African blood had rights that a white man need respect.” No wonder that human souls and immortal destinies were there bartered for the meanest merchandize of earth, and that the wailings of
<pb id="ander92" n="92"/>
despair were ascending to God both night and day from
human beings scarred, bruised, and branded within the
shades of the capital of the boasting American Republic!
(“Shame!” and cheers). He could not refrain from
using strong, plain, and <sic corr="unmistakable">unmistakeable</sic> language when
referring to this atrocious abomination. No language, to his
mind, could be too strong, too vehement, or too denunciatory,
for he was sure that, as Mrs. Stowe had eloquently said,
“nothing could be spoken or conceived equalling the frightful
reality of scenes daily and hourly acted beneath the ægis of
American law, and the shadow of the cross of Christ.” After all
that might be said on the subject that evening, they would
only be able to realize a dim picture of the despair that was at
that moment riving thousands of hearts, shattering thousands
of families, and driving a helpless and sensitive race to
absolute frenzy and despair. The condition of the slave was
that of the brute beast—a piece of property—a marketable
commodity—his own good, his conscience, his intellect, and his
affections, were ruthlessly set aside by his master. He was
spoken of, dealt with, thought of, and treated as property. He
was fed and clothed with a view to increase his value as
property, and deprived of everything that tends in the slightest
degree to detract from such value. The slaveholder declared
that even that intellect which God had given him should not be
cultivated, nor his moral perceptions exercised. Deprived by
law of the right of marriage, the slave was exposed to
influences which he should
<pb id="ander93" n="93"/>
blush to describe in their hearing (cheers); and if any
of these pitiable objects found for themselves honest,
upright, and virtuous companions, they lived in constant
apprehension of being torn asunder by the merciless
men-stealers who claimed them as their property
(“Shame!” and loud applause). Another dark feature
of the shameful system was, that no education was
permitted to the slave—he was forbidden by the law,
even to learn to read, and the gospel was thus shut out
from the dark mind of the bondman. In Louisiana, if
a slave-mother were found instructing her children, the
law proclaimed that she might be hanged by the neck,
and that a father attempting to give his son a knowledge
of letters, might be punished or killed at the discretion
of the Court. It ought also to be borne in mind, that
the physical evils of slavery, the cruelties practised, and
the modes of torture employed, were the most revolting
that could be conceived. We could never hear of
these villainous atrocities without shuddering, but still
it was right that we should know that the bloody whip,
the chain, the red-hot brand, the gag, the thumbscrew, the
cat-o'nine-tails, the dungeon, and the blood-hound, were
all in constant requisition to keep the slave in his 
condition <hi rend="italics">as a slave</hi> in the slave states of America. (Shame!)
The blood-hound was there regularly trained for hunting
and running down slaves; and advertisements were
constantly to be found in the Southern papers from
persons styling themselves “Blood-hound Trainers.” Not
long ago, he (the Chairman) had himself read one of those
<pb id="ander94" n="94"/>
advertisements where a trainer was offering to “hunt down
slaves at 15 dollars a-piece,” and recommending his hounds
as “the fleetest in the neighbourhood, never known to fail.”
From time to time in those papers advertisements might be
seen, stating that slaves had escaped with iron collars
about their necks, and some with bands of iron on their feet—
others horribly marked with the lash, or branded with 
red-hot irons—the initials of their master's name having been
burnt in the flesh, (great sensation) and as the masters
themselves advertised these facts, the charge of cruelty to
the slaves could not be contradicted or denied. (Hear, hear,
and cheers). Was it a “libel,”—a “trumped-up charge,” —a 
“foul misrepresentation,”—when the slave-holder himself said
what a villainous scoundrel he was—when he told us in his
own advertisements what a brutal monster he had been to
his slaves—when he published his own infamous acts and
rascally atrocities to the world? (Cheers) No—no—whatever
other allowances or exceptions the audience might be
disposed, in their charitableness and kindness of heart, to
make in favour of these slave-dealers, they should
remember that there was no charge more capable of clear
demonstration than that of the most barbarous inhumanity
on the part of the slaveholders towards their slaves.
(Cheers.) He did not ask them to accept that statement, on
the faith of “Exeter Hall sentimentalism,” but he pointed
them to the proof; and he declared without fear of
contradiction, that the brutal men-stealers proved to the
world that it was not
<pb id="ander95" n="95"/>
regarded as discreditable or daring to set forth, by
public advertisements, their soul-harrowing descriptions
of brutality! (Loud and long-continued applause.) He
mentioned these things that it might be known that
all the horrible atrocities and dreadful results of the
slave trade—the deaths from crushed affections and
despair, with the awful deeds of cruelty which were
constantly occurring—were all sanctioned by law, and
winked at in a land professing christianity. And more
than this, he said that the religion of the Southern
States was, at this very time, the great supporter, the
great sanctioner of these bloody doings. (Shame,
shame.) And whilst America was printing tracts, 
distributing Bibles, sending abroad her missionaries, and
expending her money in various ways for the promotion
of the gospel in foreign lands, the slave remained not
only forgotten and uncared for, but was trampled under
foot by the very churches of the land. (Applause.)
For in America, the pulpit was the great defender of the
accursed evil; the ministers of religion came forward and
tortured the hallowed pages of inspired wisdom to sanction
the bloody deed, and they stood forth as the foremost, 
the strongest defenders of this “domestic institution.”
Instead of preaching against all this tyranny
and wrong, they had sought every means of throwing
into the background whatever was contained in the
Bible in opposition to slavery, and endeavoured to
bring forward, prominently, that which could be 
tortured into the support of this slave-holding,
<pb id="ander96" n="96"/>
woman-whipping, mind-darkening, soul-destroying,
and atrocious system. (Cries of “Shame,” and loud cheers.)
To-night they had met to denounce that system as a
libel on the religion taught by the Saviour; that religion
which was based upon the glorious and world-loving
principle of love to God and love to man; that religion, to
the divine principles of which John Anderson owed his
recent escape from the jaws of death—which makes its
votaries free, and constrains them to “Do unto others as
they would be done by.” (Loud cheers.) And he (the
Chairman) sincerely trusted the result of that meeting
would be the enkindlement of a spirit of gratitude to God,
that he had made them to differ, and a feeling of
compassion and sympathy for those who were in bondage;
together with a determination to assist their brother
Anderson by such contributions as would provide for his
education, assist him in maintaining his livelihood, and
secure the freedom of those who were nearest and dearest
to him. The Chairman resumed his seat amidst enthusiastic
applause.</p>
                <p>The Rev. HUGH ALLEN, D.D., on rising to move the first
resolution, was received with loud cheering. He said he
should have considered himself unworthy of the
privileges of an Englishman, unworthy of the blessings
of liberty, unworthy of the position of a British minister of
the Gospel, and, indeed, unworthy of the privileges of
being a man, if he had not responded to the invitation
given him to be there on that occasion. (Cheers.) On a
Roman stage, and in a Roman theatre,
<pb id="ander97" n="97"/>
a heathen orator was represented to have uttered the
following sentiment in reply to the question put to him,
“Why he should interfere with the business of others?”
“I am a man—whatever is interesting to any of the human
race, must be of high and deep interest to me.”
That sentiment had elicited thunders of applause in a
Roman theatre, in heathen times, and he was quite sure
he should be insulting them as well as himself by offering
any other apology for standing there that night. (Cheers.)
They were assembled there on the grounds
of honour, on the grounds of justice, on the grounds of
humanity, and on the grounds of the religion of Jesus
Christ. (Cheers.) They were assembled on the grounds of
honour. Had we not liberated our own slaves in the West
India Islands? Had we not paid down twenty millions of
money to the planters, which we had no right to do? for, in
the words of the immortal Lord Brougham (whom God spare
long to us), “if the money ought to have been paid to
anybody it was not to the planter, who had no right to
receive a single shilling, but ought rather to have been
made to give compensation, but to the men and women who
endured from the hands of heir masters, and by the
sufferance of our country, such wrongs and such woes.”
(Cheers.) Well, then, if they paid twenty millions of money
to the planters who had no right to it, in order that there
might not be a single excuse for not liberating the slaves in
our West India Islands, were they not bound in honour to
welcome and sympathise with, and give the hand of
fellowship to,
<pb id="ander98" n="98"/>
every movement calculated to shiver to atoms the chains
of slavery and set every man free, be he black or white?
(Loud applause.) Honour compelled them to do that.
Did we not, as a nation, interfere with other countries
as far as international laws permitted us? Was it not
the policy of Great Britain to interfere by every proper
means to succour and help the oppressed in every part
of the world? (Hear, hear.) Had it not been the
policy—was it not the policy now? And, if either the
Czar of Russia, or the Emperor of Austria, were to ask
what right we had to interfere with any people that
were oppressed, we would tell them, that where oppression 
exists, the hand of England is put forward, and the
heart of England sympathises with them, so as to give
them the help needful to effect their full and complete
emancipation. (Cheers.) If, then, our sympathies were with
the oppressed of every quarter of the globe—if we
sympathised with the slaves in the West India Islands to
the tune of twenty millions—and that was not a bad test—
surely they ought to sympathise also with the man who
has struggled with and escaped from the ignoble bonds of
slavery, when the only thing that awaited him was a
tyrant's death, if his tyrant masters were able again to grasp
him in their hands. But they were there also on the grounds
of justice. It might be pleaded that this was not the law of
England. What was the law of England on this subject?
Why, the law of England was well expressed by the
immortal Curran, when he said, at a very important period
and under
<pb id="ander99" n="99"/>
very important circumstances, for he uttered it in a
court of justice, and the judge did not interfere to 
contradict him—the immortal Curran said, when speaking of the
English law on this subject, “no matter where a man was
born, nor what was the colour of his skin; no matter with
what readiness his rights and liberties had been bartered
away, no matter under what circumstances, no matter how
long ago, or in what way brought about, the moment his
foot touches the soil of Britain the manacles fall at his feet.
(Cheers.) The moment he stands beneath the flag of
England, that moment he is free, regenerated, transformed,
emancipated—set free by the justice of British law, and the
spirit of British freedom.” (Loud cheers.) Then, upon the
ground of sheer justice, he would take his stand and say no
man had a right to sell a man, be his colour what it might—no
man had a right to sell, and no man had a right to buy.
(Cheers.) He denied the right of any man to plunder another.
(Loud cheers.) He denied the right of the captain to convey
him across the seas, the right of the auctioneer to sell him,
and the right of the tyrant to buy him—he denied their right
from first to last. (Loud cheers.) He declared, without fear of
successful contradiction, no matter how the courts of
America might talk upon the subject, that it was wholesale
and abominable robbery, and that it believed all with a
spark of humanity to rise up to crush and put it down. (Cheers.)
They were there that night on the ground of humanity.
Were the slaves not men? (A voice:
<pb id="ander100" n="100"/>
“They say they are not.”) Were they not men? (“Yes,” and
loud applause.) Yes, they were, and that itself was argument
enough. (Cheers.) If that man (pointing to Anderson) was not
so well educated as those he saw before him, who was to
blame? If he was not able to perform actions and earn his
living as he ought, who was to blame? Who was to blame for
allowing that fine form to grow up uneducated? Look at him!
He is a man! And who dared to assert on the ground of
humanity that he had a right to inflict any injury upon those
two men (directing attention to Mr. Anderson and the Rev.
Mr. Kinnaird), or any other man? (Cheers.) But there was
another and far higher ground, and that was the ground of
religion. He knew it was commonly asked, where was slavery
put down in the Bible? Where did they read it? Give the text
that puts down slavery. Ah! he would give it them in a few
moments. (Loud cheers.) The spirit of the entire Bible was a
spirit of freedom. It taught that every man had a responsible
soul. He asserted that the entire spirit of the Bible—and the
Bible taught by principles as well as by positive statements—
the great principle of the Bible—the New Testament and the
Old too, were entirely at variance with the principles of
slavery. (Cheers.) Look at this one text, “Honour all men.” He
would like to ask some of those ministers who preach in
favour of slavery to discourse from that text for him. (Cheers.)
“Honour all men.” He should like to ask any man who talked
about the authority
<pb id="ander101" n="101"/>
of the Bible, to expound that passage for him. It did
not say “some” men, but “all” men—not a man of one
colour, but men of every colour—not men privileged in
high degree, but men privileged in a low degree.
(Cheers.) “Honour all men” is the word of eternal
truth, the principle of Holy Writ, the principle he 
himself had always preached and would preach to the day
of his death. (Cheers.) He would ask that man who
said he had the authority of the New Testament for
slavery, to show him that authority in the life of the
Apostles—could he show it in the life of primitive
Christians? He had a deep feeling of horror for the
judgment of the man who had the terrible and frightful
audacity to stand up in a pulpit and preach in defence
of slavery. (Cheers.) He was there that night on the
principle of honour, on the principle of justice, on the
principle of our common humanity, and, above all, on
the principles of our holy religion—the religion of our
Lord Jesus Christ. (Cheers.) He was there on those
principles as enumerated in the passage, “Go ye into
the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.”
Not to preach a portion of the gospel as they did in
some parts of America—not a few of the moral precepts
only, but to preach the whole gospel to every creature.
(Cheers.) Did they suppose that the moment the black
man knew he had a responsible soul—when he knew
that soul was immortal and responsible, as well as that
of the white man—that he would be contented in slavery?
Could they imagine that when the soul could escape
<pb id="ander102" n="102"/>
from the prison that immured it, shake off the chains that
bound it—when that soul could traverse the world and
ascend to the very stars in its conceptions—such a man
would sit down content in slavery? (Cheers.) He could
not. One thing he knew—they were bound to help him out
of slavery, they were bound to give him the right hand of
fellowship; and, if one person more than another were
called upon to do this, he, as a minister of religion, was
so, and, therefore, he assured them he had very great
pleasure in attending here and moving the first resolution:—</p>
                <p>“That this Meeting, recognizing the common
brotherhood of mankind, and asserting the inalienable right
of every man to freedom, desires to express its earnest
sympathy with John Anderson; and, rejoicing at his
escape from the slave-hunters, hereby gives him a hearty
welcome to England.”</p>
                <p>The conclusion of Dr. Allen's remarks was received
with loud and prolonged cheering.</p>
                <p>The Rev. JABEZ BURNS, D.D., of Paddington, seconded
the resolution. He said that he was sure, after the very
thorough exposition of the resolution itself which they had
just heard, much more concerning it could not be said, 
inasmuch as his friend, Dr. Allen, had
taken in the realms of justice, humanity, honour, and
religion; and, therefore, the whole ground, extensive as it
was with respect to their views of the subject, had already
been occupied. (Cheers.) He was anxious, however, to
express the very great pleasure he felt at
<pb id="ander103" n="103"/>
witnessing the crowded  of that evening.
He was sure the friends of John Anderson had done
wisely in testing the public feeling in London on this
question; for the public of London, whenever properly
tested on it, would always respond; and he did not care
whether the <hi rend="italics">Times,</hi> or the <hi rend="italics">Telegraph,</hi> or anybody else
engaged in literature, or on the press, tried to prevent
them, there were the sound heart and common sympathy that
would always come to the surface. (Loud cheers.) Then, he
heartily rejoiced that his friend Mr. Twelvetrees was the
Chairman of the evening. It happened that that gentleman
was a master employing a great number of men, and if he
had thought him (Mr. T.) capable of being a little despot in
his own sphere, he would have had none of his attendance
that night. (Laughter and cheers). Now, their Chairman not
only sympathised with their black friends, with whom they
all sympathised most heartily, but he sympathised with white
people too. (Cheers.) He did not think white people ought
to be oppressed any more than black, and if they had got
some despot in the chair, who was in the habit of ruling with
an iron hand over those he employed, at the same time that
he expressed great sympathy for the blacks in America, he
would not have acted with him. (Cheers.) He looked through
the man. Principles did not attach themselves to colour or
locality, or any period of the world history. Principles were
eternal and unchangeable, suited to every place and every
body, and it was just because their Chairman
<pb id="ander104" n="104"/>
was a liberal master, and one who sought the welfare and
happiness of those he employed, that he was glad to be
present and support him that night. (Cheers.)
Then again, as they were well aware, some persons 
had been very much alarmed at this movement, lest it
should interfere (he did not know how) with the settlement
of the American crisis. (Hear, hear). All he could say was,
that if the public enunciation and thorough-going
exposition of the principles of Liberty would interfere, let
them interfere (cheers), and let American principles and
institutions settle themselves, as they would very shortly.
They knew there was an old proverb, and never was
proverb so applicable to the present times as that, “when
rogues fall out, then honest men get their own.” (Laughter
and cheers.) He had great hope, being a thorough peace
man, and hating all war, that God, in his good providence,
would open a door of escape, and while the rogues were
quarrelling, all he could say was, that the coloured people
must be much more thick-headed than he had taken them
to be, if they did not “cut and run.” (Loud cheers and
laughter.) They knew some people were very much afraid of cotton
(a laugh), now, he would much rather that all the ladies of
England should clothe themselves with the production of
our own forests, than that slavery should be perpetuated.
(Cheers). The other day he observed in
the daily papers an advertisement to the effect that a
certain reverend Doctor of Divinity from America would
take the chair on the 4th of July, at a public
<pb id="ander105" n="105"/>
meeting in London, to commemorate the anniversary of
American Independence. Now, he had taken tea with
that same Doctor of Divinity in 1847, and on that 
occasion he was asked by the Doctor if he (the speaker),
had altered his opinions on American slavery. He said
to the Doctor at that time what he now said here, and
what he was not afraid to say in the Slave States of
America, that the foundation and base of American
slavery was the professing Church of Christ. (Loud
cheers.) And he then appealed to that reverend and
estimable brother, and said, “Just look here; supposing
every Christian minister, in every Christian pulpit, on
any one Lord's Day would do their duty justly before
God on the subject of slavery, it would not exist for a
single hour.” (Loud applause.) And he would wish
that meeting to remember that while the South was
most deeply imbrued in the crimes of slavery, the
States of the North had not clean hands in the matter
(cheers); and it seemed to him that Providence was
compelling the Northern States to take up their right
position. And although there was a great deal of 
sentimentality assumed for the slaves in the States of the
North, which was frequently expressed in such forms
as, “What are we to do with them?”—“How are we to
employ them?” (A voice: “Send them here”) yet he
ventured to say that anything else taken in the war,
they would find no difficulty in disposing of, according
to the acknowledged principles of war. He did not say
whether these principles were right or wrong, but he
<pb id="ander106" n="106"/>
did say these sympathisers might, on the principles of
humanity, make suitable provision for liberated slaves.
(Hear, hear.) He thought that before the war had lasted
long, they would recognise the voice of God, saying to
them as was said to the despot of old, “Let the people go,
and let them be free.” (Cheers.) Now, a great many persons
have sympathy for the American slave. There was their
good southern brother Anderson, who owed his presence
here to that sympathy. (Cheers.) There was their Christian
brother on the right (pointing to the Rev. Mr. Kinnaird),
who would make two Yankees any day (laughter);
absolutely divided, their good brother would make two of
them. Stand up! (addressing Mr. Kinnaird, who immediately
answered the call amidst a burst of applause from every
part of the spacious building). They had now a great
number of fugitive slaves coming to this country, and he
fancied the church with which he was connected got a
good many of them, for he observed two or three there
every Sunday. It was not for the purpose of creating
enthusiasm in the meeting that he said this, but there were
peculiar circumstances in the history of John Anderson
which had called forth a deep and intense love of liberty,
for which we as a nation were so happily distinguished.
Their brother had effected his escape, and in doing so had
been placed in a very unhappy position himself. He was a
member of a Christian Church, and a believer in Jesus
Christ, and anxious that his moral nature should be
developed as well as his physical. But he was pursued,
<pb id="ander107" n="107"/>
and whether he then acted rightly or wrongly, his
own conscience would answer—he knew what the meeting
thought on that point, and he himself thought that if
anybody ought to die, it should not be the poor slave,
but the slave-hunter. (Cheers.) He should have liked
it much better, could his friend have resembled the
illustrious Irishman who, when asked how he managed
to bring three persons to the police-office, characteristically
replied, “I' faith, y're honour, I surrounded them.”
(Laughter and cheers.) He should have been glad if
his friend could have captured the slave-hunter and
brought him to England. But it was not so. The
slave-hunter fell, and John Anderson escaped. He
reached the British territory, and took it for granted,
that being surrounded by thousands of fugitive slaves
who had escaped, he was all right, and when the danger
of his being again taken back into slavery was talked
about, the growl of the British Lion went across the
Atlantic, saying to the American Eagle that it would
have no liberty to pounce upon its prey in Canada.
(Loud cheers). But there were numbers of time-serving
people there—persons capable of truckling to anything,
and it became apparent that his friend John Anderson
might yet go back to the place where he did not
want to go. (Laughter and cheers.) Now, in his
estimation, the most honourable thing ever done by
England since it received the principles of the gospel
was, when the question was raised before the highest
judicial authority in England, she sent her mandate to
<pb id="ander108" n="108"/>
Canada, and said, “Let the fugitive slave be brought to
England.” (Loud cheers.) Oh, yes! He loved his
country, and he loved her the more that she had done
that good thing. What! talented lawyers and 
hoary-headed judges sit in convention about a poor fugitive—
a man who would have been sold for something like a
thousand dollars in Missouri or any other slave-state—
all this trouble—all this legislation—all this expense—
about him! Yes, to the honour of England, this was so: and 
he doubted whether in the whole civilized world another 
country would have been found to do this, or put itself 
to even half the trouble. (Cheers.) He was inclined to 
think John Anderson need not fear the miserable slave-hunter 
in London—that he might go to bed without trembling, 
and sleep without alarm. (Applause.) As his friend Dr. Allen 
had said in his speech, “Is he not a man!” Aye, and an intelligent 
man. (Cheers.) Look at his head! As a believer in phrenology, 
he might say he had an excellent head—in fact, he was 
altogether a nice looking man. (Laughter.) In his
<hi rend="italics">physique</hi> there was everything to recommend him to the
meeting, and as he had asked on a previous occasion, did he
look like an assassin or a murderer? (“No, no,” and cheers.) He
would venture to say that most men would have followed the
example of his friend had they been placed in that peculiar
position, which involved the necessity of killing or being
killed. (Cheers.) Now, the resolution said they must
sympathise with him. They did sympathise with him already if
they might
<pb id="ander109" n="109"/>
judge from the noisy demonstrations of the meeting.
(Cheers and laughter.) But that sympathy must assume
a practical form. Their friend must be maintained—
placed in a respectable position in life—and his wife 
restored to him as soon as possible. (Cheers.) Now, he 
should deeply regret if this manifestation of sympathy
should not thus result. In another fortnight, the news 
of their friend's reception would have sped across the 
Atlantic; and while his friends here rejoice, thousands 
in Canada will rejoice, and weep, and pray, and bless 
God together. (Loud cheers.) He would just say in
conclusion, that he hoped the meeting would do the right
thing. There appeared a disposition on the part of the
Committee, their worthy Chairman, and all whom he had
consulted, to do this; and he hoped the echo from this
meeting would meet with a response throughout the
country, and that all would be prepared to do the right
thing, and do it in a proper manner. (Cheers.) Here is a man
who has been in bonds, and we rejoice that he is free—here is
a man who has been in imminent peril; we rejoice that he is
safe—and we give him, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
a christian reception—a cordial and hearty christian
reception. (Loud cheers.) And we hope the support of this
meeting will be a rebuke to all slave-holders and 
slavery-patronizers, on the other side of the Atlantic, whether
North or South: and they may depend that however much
concerned we are for the settlement of their differences, we
are far
<pb id="ander110" n="110"/>
more concerned for the freedom of the human species.
(Loud applause, which continued for some minutes.)</p>
                <p>The Rev. W. H. BONNER, of the London Emancipation 
Committee, in supporting the resolution, said
that he was glad to see the meeting appreciated the
importance of this question, in which he had taken
considerable interest for a long period of time. He 
rejoiced to see his friend Mr. Twelvetrees occupying 
the chair, and hoped soon to see him occupy another seat, 
where he would be enabled to speak on a question which 
he knew and understood, and took so deep an interest in. 
(Cheers.) He felt great pleasure in being here because 
he considered it an event of the highest importance—of 
importance to their brother in the midst of them—of 
importance to the race to which he belongs—of 
importance to this country and to America, both as 
regards our political and religious constitution. (Cheers.) 
In expressing our sympathy with our brother Anderson, we 
could not separate the fugitive from the institution under 
which he has been held—could not leave the latter out of sight. 
They all understood their object was not to express any 
sympathy with the South, which had brought all the evils 
from which it was now suffering on itself; nor were they 
there to plead for the North, for he believed the latter in 
its quarrel with the South was merely an illustration of the 
pot calling the kettle black. (Laughter and cheers.) They 
were met for the purpose of promoting Emancipation. He welcomed 
John Anderson most heartily, and thanked God he was
<pb id="ander111" n="111"/>
in Exeter Hall that night—for he looked upon him in the
light of a representative man. (Hear, hear.) They must
regard him as the victim of a gigantic system of crime
which tramples out manhood, and is an insult to God
himself. (Loud cheers.) The same Almighty Being who gave
the sun the power to shine, who caused the rain to fall,
and holds the winds in the hollow of his hand, gave
that manhood, and he who would deprive him of it aims
at the gift of God himself (cheers), and questions his
right to make his creatures as he thinks fit. It was a
wrong to man himself, for no man can create a right in
another—if he usurps or steals it, he is a thief. (Loud
cheers.) Not only was it an iniquity in itself, but it
denied to man all domestic and social rights and privileges,
for if not owner of himself, it was impossible for
him to own wife or children—in fact, this was one of the
principles of American law. And what was this but subverting
society, undermining social order, and producing vice of
every description! (Cheers.) Therefore, every philanthropist,
every friend of man, every child of God must, if he act up
conscientiously to his duty, say, “Welcome to Anderson, and 
down with slavery.” (Loud applause.) It was sometimes urged by 
Americans that, as England once countenanced Slavery, and was 
the original means of its introduction into America, she 
should not denounce it. Even admitting the fact, which
was, however, open to dispute, he urged, that having 
been guilty of sin and crime, was no reason why we
should not now denounce it.  If it were true that we introduced
<pb id="ander112" n="112"/>
slavery into America, thanks be to God we are
now free from it, and can say, “Come, follow our 
example.” We have felt the glory of our position, and 
as we never intended slavery to exist upon our soil, we 
are amply justified in saying, “Go thou, and do likewise.” 
(Cheers.) He was glad to see upon the platform 
that night his friend William Craft, who has succeeded, 
with his heroic wife, in effecting their escape over a 
thousand miles of country, in spite of the whole army 
and navy of the United States, proffered by Millard 
Fillmore to prevent his escape—thanks be to God, and 
to that eloquent orator and noble champion of the Anti-Slavery 
cause, George Thompson. (Great cheering.) Not only did 
the blame attach to the slave-trader and the slave-holder, 
but also to the pro-slavery voter, and behind all these, 
he was grieved to place the Northern pulpit. He firmly believed, 
that if the pulpit of the North had been true to the 
doctrines of Christ, slavery, would have ceased to exist 
long ere this. (Loud cheers.) There were preachers of all 
denominations holding shades of opinions on the question, but 
agreeing in the main pro-slavery feeling, and he did not 
hesitate to declare that the popular ministers of America 
were the bulwarks of slavery. (“Shame” and applause.) 
It was necessary to put our hand upon the evil—to
speak kindly, but firmly, and say, “Brethren, have no 
fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but 
rather reprove them.” (Loud and continued applause.)</p>
                <p>A gentleman of the name of Matthew Feilde here
<pb id="ander113" n="113"/>
came forward, and endeavoured to obtain a hearing, for 
the purpose of proposing an amendment to the resolution. 
The Chairman in vain urged the audience to hear the speaker, 
as they were determined not to do so. <sic corr="The">the</sic> amendment met with 
no seconder, and the original resolution having been put, was 
carried by acclamation,</p>
                <p>The Chairman then rose, as well as John Anderson, 
and addressing the latter said, “JOHN ANDERSON, 
you have heard the rapturous voice of WELCOME 
from Englishmen, inducting you into the rights, 
privileges, and immunities of this our happy land. In the
name of this vast assembly I present to you the right
hand of fellowship, and congratulate you on the possession
of this goodly heritage, which you now enter upon 
FREE AS THE AIR YOU BREATHE, so that you 
may really and truly say, “I thank my God that I am at last 
a man,” and although still trembling and panting with 
your recent run for life, you may now strike your foot 
on English soil—consecrated to liberty, freedom, and 
religion—a portion of which, in this bottle, I now 
present to you, to carry in your bosom as a certificate 
which shall be honoured throughout the world, that 
you are FREE.”</p>
                <p>The Chairman then handed to Anderson a small 
bottle containing some of the free soil of England, on 
which was inscribed, “John Anderson's Certificate of 
Freedom, presented at Exeter Hall, London, July 2nd, 
1861,” and then introduced him to the meeting, as
“Citizen Anderson.” At this point, the whole of the
<pb id="ander114" n="114"/>
vast assemblage rose, and with the utmost enthusiasm, 
gave forth loud and prolonged cheers, coupled with
waving of hats and handkerchiefs.  This highly impressive
scene lasted for several minutes, and, after it had subsided,</p>
                <p>JOHN ANDERSON, who met with an overwhelming 
reception, which appeared somewhat to bewilder him, 
said: All honour to England. All honour to Her 
Majesty the Queen, for my freedom. I feel very backward, 
the disturbance has quite upset me, and I do not 
know that I can make my speech out. (“Go on”—
Cheers and laughter). My worthy friend has upset me 
so, that I don't know if I can get through. I feel very
thankful for my escape, for I have been chased for a 
very long time, and have only got free about three 
weeks ago. I want to describe my narrow escape, but 
I don't know that I shall get through with it. I feel so 
disturbed by a great audience like this. I thank God I have 
at last broken the yoke. (Hear, hear.) I thought
I had seven years ago, but I never did till now, and now 
I have to thank God and Great Britain for it. So I 
give all credit to Great Britain, and if I get no further 
in my speech, you must not blame me, for it is very hard 
for me to get on at all, I can tell you. (Cheers and laughter.) 
I will describe my escape. I remember my master, a man 
named Burton, selling me to a man named McDonald, with whom 
I stayed about a month and a half, and then asked if I could 
go and see my family. He said “No.” I left him then and went 
to the Missouri
<pb id="ander115" n="115"/>
River, but they would not let me cross unless I had 
a pass. I said my master had gone out, so I could not
get one, but they would not let me cross. I went back
and laid about till night, and then they chased me away,
and I crossed the river, and got to the house of my
father-in-law. I told him I was going to Canada. He
said, “I have got a pistol—will you take it with you?”
I said, “No.” Then I went on to my wife's house, but
a slave-catcher named Brown chased me away from
there. I then ran towards Canada, and on the third day
Came across a man named Diggs. He said, “Where are
you going?” I said I was making my way to some
farmer's house. He said, “I will go with you, you are
a runaway.” I tried to escape, and he chased me for 
half a day. I begged of him for four hours not to
follow me, and told him that if he did I should be
obliged to slay him—but nothing would do but he must
take me dead or alive. He came to take me, and I
struck him a blow. He came again, and I struck him
again on the left side, and he came no more. I thank
God that I have had the fear of God in my soul, otherwise
I should never have made my escape. I was very sorry to 
slay the man—I did not believe he was dead till
they came to swear against me. A thousand dollars were
offered to any one who would take me across the
lines, and there are plenty of people in Canada who
would do a great deal for that money. I will now state
what religions my owners were. Burton was a Methodist,
and McDonald was a Baptist—a member of the same
<pb id="ander116" n="116"/>
church as myself. I know I tried to be a good man—
but I doubt them very much indeed. (Hear, hear, and
laughter.) Brothers and sisters, for I know I may call
you so (loud cheers), I feel very much obliged to you
for your attendance to-night, and for your kindness
toward me, and I offer you three cheers. (Laughter.)
Three cheers, then, for Her Gracious Majesty the Queen.
The speaker resumed his seat amid deafening applause.</p>
                <p>At this point of the meeting, a collection was made
On behalf of the objects of the meeting as stated above.</p>
                <p>The Rev. T. M. KINNAIRD, a coloured clergyman,
then rose and said, there was some few facts which he
was desirous of making publicly known. It had been
generally assumed by the slave population of America,
who had been tutored to that effect by their masters and
others, that sooner or later Canada would be connected
with the States, and that hence, all the slaves who had
escaped would again be reduced to bondage. The language
which had been used at this meeting—the knowledge
of which would, depend upon it, reach the fugitive
slaves in Canada, ere long would totally destroy that
impression. (Cheers.) Again, there had been some
doubts as to whether the laws of Great Britain afforded
absolute and undeniable protection to the slaves in
Canada, and he was glad that the result in the case of
John Anderson had most triumphantly and satisfactorily
settled that question. (Cheers.) With regard to the
conduct of John Anderson, he himself was no murderer
—his heart was too big for that—but he should be
<pb id="ander117" n="117"/>
forgetting his duty if he did not boldly and unhesitatingly 
state that he would, if similarly placed, have uphold his 
God-given right. (Cheers.) In Canada, there were 
numbers of persons with pro-slavery feelings, who would 
willingly have sold Anderson to his enemies, but the 
voice and the power of the great British nation went 
forth, the fiat of the Queen fell as a flash of lightning 
upon Toronto, and the fugitive was saved. (Cheers.) 
He appealed to them earnestly to help John Anderson. 
Had any of his brothers in the meeting a wife and little
ones yet dwelling amongst the horrors, exposed to the 
cruelties and degrading influences of slavery, would 
they not desire with their whole heart to be enabled 
to release them from such a state, and be joined together 
in social happiness and bliss? He urged them 
therefore strongly to assist brother Anderson in such a 
high and holy aim. (Cheers.) He then adverted to an 
article which had recently appeared in the columns of a 
morning journal which he described as having so strong 
a pro-slavery leaning, that he could not but believe at 
first that it formed a portion of the contents of a Southern 
newspaper, rather than of a leading English journal. 
The writer of that article had professed to be ignorant 
of the existence of such a place as Hamilton, Canada 
West, but if he would pay the speaker a short visit, his 
geographical knowledge of that quarter should be improved. 
(Cheers and laughter.) He was rejoiced that this great 
meeting had given his brother Anderson his certificate of 
freedom, and hailed him as a man; and
<pb id="ander118" n="118"/>
he trusted and believed that he would do honour to 
those who had thus honoured him. (Loud cheers.) 
He begged to move the following resolution:—</p>
                <p>“That this Meeting, deeply sympathising with those
coloured persons who have in Canada sought the 
protection of the British Crown, and who are amongst 
the most loyal subjects of Her Majesty, pledges itself to 
use every endeavour to maintain their rights and liberties 
inviolate.”</p>
                <p>The Rev. J. G. HEWLETT, D.D., in seconding the 
resolution, said that the occurrences of that evening 
brought vividly to his remembrance the days of his 
youth, when Emancipation was the great question of 
the day, and he rejoiced in the present occasion specially, 
because we were now recognising a great and glorious 
principle which we had previously announced. (Hear, 
hear.) He could not avoid referring for a moment to 
the plausible and fallacious argument sometimes used 
by the advocates of slavery, in which they adverted to 
the kind treatment and excellent education of the slaves, 
and he had been shocked to hear comparisons instituted 
between their condition and that of the working classes 
of this country, to the disadvantage of the latter. He 
thought the best refutation of such an argument was to 
be found in the condition of brother Anderson, and he would 
recommend all such as advanced that argument 
to take the place of the slave for awhile and test the 
accuracy of their statements and deductions. (Cheers 
and laughter.) He had been exceedingly pleased to
<pb id="ander119" n="119"/>
find that none of the speakers had entered upon the 
question as a political one, and that the meeting had 
had the good sense to repudiate a proposed amendment, 
the terms of which would have implicated them in a 
hostile attitude to the Government of the United States. 
(Hear, hear.) He must say, that as he had seen John 
Anderson, and had been deeply interested, he should 
have liked to have seen also in England a veritable slave-catcher. 
(Cheers.) It might have been useful for the
purpose of determining whether he more closely 
resembled man or the gorilla. (Laughter.) One other remark 
he desired to make, and that was how wonderfully Providence 
appeared to work with reference to their cause. 
Just as when the eloquent, silvery-voiced Wilberforce 
had brought before the House the evils of slavery in 
our West Indian possessions, in which he was ably 
followed by Sir T. F. Buxton, when their efforts appeared 
almost unavailing the missionary Smith was imprisoned in 
Demerara for his denunciation of slavery, and a chapel in 
Barbadoes was burnt to the ground which drew the 
attention of the House to the subject, and led to discussions 
which resulted in abolition—while Smith in his 
prison cell was oppressed with gloomy thoughts, God was 
working out his will—so with John Anderson, in the 
time of his struggle—in the hour of battle—he knew 
not that God was making him the humble instrument of 
proclaiming the advent of freedom to the coloured population 
of America. (Loud cheers.) He did trust that a liberal sympathy 
would be exercised with regard to
<pb id="ander120" n="120"/>
Anderson which would bring about the restoration of 
his family, and that their prayers might also rise to 
Heaven that he might be preserved from all temptation, 
and become an honoured subject and citizen of Great 
Britain. The speaker concluded by seconding the 
resolution amidst loud cheers.</p>
                <p>Mr. WILLIAM CRAFT, the author of the celebrated 
book, “<hi rend="italics">A Run of a Thousand Miles for Freedom,</hi>” in 
supporting the resolution, said that as one who had been 
a slave, and had had the good fortune to escape from that 
horrible condition, he most heartily sympathised with 
his brother Anderson. (Cheers.) He was absent in the 
North of Scotland on business when intelligence of the 
proposed meeting reached him, but he felt it his duty to 
give up every engagement in order to be present. They 
were often told by the advocates of slavery that slaves 
were well treated, and if freed, would not be able to take 
care of themselves. If they were all freed that very 
night, no doubt there would be many amongst them, 
who would be unable to provide for their subsistence, 
like many who were living in this enlightened city; 
but he totally denied the general truth of the statement. 
(Hear, hear.) As to whether they desired freedom, he 
would appeal to 45,000 emancipated slaves in Canada, as 
well as to numerous coloured friends on that platform. 
These 45,000 men had, with only God's north star as a 
guide, baffled the bloodhounds of their pursuers, lay in 
pestilential swamps, and swam or floated over mighty 
rivers to reach the Canadian shore, and had earned and
<pb id="ander121" n="121"/>
deserved their freedom! (Cheers.) All honour to the 
Queen—honour to the British nation for their noble 
refusal to deliver up one of their number. (Loud cheers.) 
Though no blood-shedder, he firmly believed that every 
Englishman—every man—would have acted as Anderson 
had acted under the like circumstances. Referring 
to the religious education afforded to slaves in the 
Southern states, he gave a sketch of a sermon of one of 
the instructors most popular with the planters, and 
characterised it as blasphemy—blasphemy to attribute the 
sanction of the debasing institution to that great and 
beneficent Being who sent his plagues into Egypt in 
order to free the Israelites from their bondage, who, by 
the hand of his servant Moses, led them out, dividing 
the waters, and causing them to fall back and overwhelm 
the Egyptians in their pursuit—for God and his attributes 
were immutable and eternal. (Loud cheers.) He thought 
great credit was due to the Committee for the organisation 
of this meeting, and he seconded the resolution with unfeigned 
pleasure. The resolution was then put and carried <hi lang="lat" rend="italics">nem con.</hi></p>
                <p>The Rev. EDWARD MATHEWS (introduced by the 
Chairman as the prototype of <hi rend="italics">“Father Dickson”</hi> in 
Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe's tale of <hi rend="italics">“Dred,”</hi>) entered 
upon a recital of his personal experience in the Southern 
States, showing that in consequence of his abolitionist 
views, he was ten successive times thrown into a pond of 
water in the depth of winter, and that it was a matter of 
consideration at one time whether he should be hanged
<pb id="ander122" n="122"/>
on a neighbouring tree or not. He felt some little doubt 
as to whether the safety of the fugitive slaves in Canada
was yet properly guaranteed. In moving a resolution
for the appointment of a Committee, he remarked on the 
good effects such a step was likely to produce. He 
believed it would give fresh vitality to the Anti-Slavery 
cause (hear, hear,) and, while rejoicing that their worthy 
Chairman had taken the responsibility of presiding, 
expressed a hope that the time was not far distant when 
he would be enabled to exercise a vote and influence on the 
question in the House of Commons. (Loud cheers.)</p>
                <p>The Rev. T. J. MESSER, in seconding the resolution, 
remarked that perhaps he was one of the oldest advocates 
of the abolition of slavery in all its withering and Protean 
forms on that platform. For more than forty years had 
he laboured in the cause. It was his belief that slavery 
in all its debasing forms, with all its sin and crime must 
soon pass away. The grass might grow upon his grave 
ere the dawn of that day, but he had a firm conviction 
that all forms, all pressures past of slavery, were doomed 
to a speedy extinction. (Cheers.) From some height 
in the city of sunlight and of song, he should behold the 
<sic corr="original printing error">the</sic> last fetter struck from the last slave! Having toiled 
to bring about the utter extinction of Colonial bondage 
and having lived to see the glorious day when all the 
slaves of the ebon islands of the West sang “Hosannah” 
because they were free, he believed that he yet should 
live to see—should he say it—Transatlantic bondage 
crushed out for ever and ever, and then, from an emancipated
<pb id="ander123" n="123"/>
people, as though touched by Ithuriel's spear,
a jubilant song should rise right up from earth to the
throne of the Most High in Heaven. (Loud and long-continued 
cheering.)</p>
                <p>The Rev. P. POCOCK, B.A., felt assured that at that
late hour he should but study the desires of those present
by being exceedingly brief. One thing struck him as
rather peculiar, and that was the absence of any positive
evidence of the death of John Anderson's opponent.
There was only, it appeared, one individual who gave
evidence on the point, and he was distant some three 
miles from the spot where the meeting took place. 
(Cheers and laughter.) Aware, as they were, of the 
devices and schemes to which the slave-holders had 
resorted, it just occurred to him that this point was 
deserving of attention. After quoting several passages 
of Scripture, and showing that these were diametrically 
opposed to the principles and practices of slavery, Mr. 
Pocock concluded by supporting the resolution.</p>
                <p>The resolution, which was as follows, was then put 
from the chair, and carried unanimously—</p>
                <p>“That the following gentlemen constitute a Committee 
to raise a fund on behalf of John Anderson—</p>
                <p>Harper Twelvetrees, <hi rend="italics">Chairman;</hi> The Honourable

          <p>Attends various Meetings in London and its Neighbourbood.—

        </argument>
        <p>IN the interval between the great meeting in Exeter 
Hall and the close of the month of September, Anderson 
attended a large number of meetings, besides frequently 
addressing the teachers and scholars of Sunday schools 
in the metropolis and its vicinity. We have not before 
us a complete list of these engagements, but we know 
that amongst the number were meetings at the Marylebone 
Institute; Deverell Street, Southwark; Camden Road 
Chapel; Rev. Mr. Spong's Chapel, De Beauvoir Town, 
Kingsland; Markham Square, Chelsea; Devons Road Chapel, 
Bromley-by-Bow; Temperance Hall, Stratford, Essex; the 
Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, Poplar; the Town Hall, Brentford; 
Colnbrook; the Town Hall, Brighton; the Town Hall, Worthing; 
Hastings; the Assembly Rooms, St. Leonards; Folkestone; Deal; 
Dover; Margate; Ramsgate; St. Alban's; Luton;
Hemel Hempstead; &amp;c., &amp;c. At many of these
<pb id="ander126" n="126"/>
meetings addresses were also delivered by the Rev. J. G.
Hewlett, D.D., George Thompson, Esq., (late M.P.
for the Tower Hamlets), and John Noble, Esq., of the
Middle Temple, as deputations from the John Anderson
Committee.  John Anderson was also present and spoke
at the meeting commemorative of West Indian Emancipation,
held under the auspices of the London Emancipation 
Committee in Spafields Chapel, on the 1st of August, 1861.</p>
        <p>At all these meetings the appearance of Anderson excited
deep interest, and the statements made by him were
listened to with the deepest attention. A gentleman
who was present at the meetings addressed by
Anderson at Hastings and St. Leonard's, has furnished
us with notes made on those occasions. As specimens
of the way in which Anderson was at that time
accustomed to tell his own story, we insert them with
pleasure and gratitude, assured that our readers will
excuse the repetition of certain facts, and be glad to
possess examples of the early public utterances of a
fugitive slave.</p>
        <p>At Hastings, Anderson said,—“My mother was a
woman of high spirit, and would not submit to harsh
treatment—to abuse and blows—so she was sold to a
negro trader, to be sent to the plantations of Louisiana
and Texas.” He (Anderson) was employed on Burton's
farm in the cultivation of wheat, Indian corn, oats, rye,
and tobacco. During the latter period of his service,
the chief management of the farm was committed to him.
<pb id="ander127" n="127"/>
The immediate cause of his sale to McDonald was the
following:—“Having offended his master, he was ordered
to strip, to cross his hands, and have his wrists tied with
a cord, and be flogged.  He removed his jacket, but 
refused to be bound, or to stand still while the whipping
was given. His master, in a rage went into the house
and came back with a gun, and was preparing to shoot
him when he was prevented by the interposition of his
two daughters. He allowed Anderson, for the time, to
escape punishment, but declared his determination to
sell him. Anderson observed that he preferred to be 
sold to being flogged. The storm blew over, and matters
for a short time went on as usual. At length when he
had finished a day's work, he went to Burton and enquired
if there was anything more for him to do that day. His
master said, ‘No,’ and added, ‘you will do no more work
for me, for I have sold you.’ The following day he was
taken across the river to a place called Glasgow, where
he saw a thousand dollars paid by McDonald to Burton,
received the money and transferred Anderson to his
new master, who soon after started for his farm, taking
Anderson with him. The master drove himself in a gig,
while Anderson followed on horse-back. The road lay
through a prairie country, and Anderson was careful to
observe the course taken that he might, when he desired
to do so, find his way back to the river.</p>
        <p>“Before McDonald took him away, he had asked him
if he was willing to go; he had replied that he was, but
he had not promised to stay, and did not mean to do so.
<pb id="ander128" n="128"/>
After McDonald got home he offered to make Anderson 
his coachman, but this office he declined, as its duties 
would have deprived him of his rest on Sunday. He was 
therefore sent into the field. After awhile he requested 
permission to return to Brown's to see his wife, and that 
he might obtain permission, said that she had some 
clothes, which he wished to bring to the plantation. 
His master told him he would not be allowed to visit his 
wife, and as for the clothes, they should be sent for. His 
master tried to terrify him by saying that he would cut him 
in pieces if he attempted to run away. As for a wife, if 
he wanted one, he would find him one upon the plantation. 
He said nothing, but waited until his master had 
to be absent one Sunday, in attendance some miles off, 
at a church meeting, for inquiring into the death of a 
slave, who it was alleged had been killed by one of the 
church members. His master started for the place of 
meeting on the Saturday night, and very early on the 
Sunday morning—a good while before daylight—he 
started for the river.”</p>
        <p>At St. Leonard's, Anderson said,—“My mother was
sold away down to New Orleans when I was about seven 
years old. She had a great big spirit, something like 
me, and <sic corr="wouldn't">would'nt</sic> stand being beat about and knocked 
around. One day her mistress and she had a fight, and 
my mother pulled a handful of hair out of my mistress's 
head. For this she was sold, and went down South, and 
I have never seen her since. Slave women have no 
rights, no matter what their colour may be. Some of
<pb id="ander129" n="129"/>
them are as white as English women are, but because 
their mothers have been women with some negro blood
in them, they are slaves, and are treated as slaves. 
They are without protection, and white men may do
what they please with them, for there is no law for a 
poor slave woman. Some folks say slaveholders may be good 
Christians, but I can't and won't believe it, nor do I 
think that a slaveholder can get to heaven. He may 
possibly get there, I don't know; but though I wish to 
get there myself, I don't want to have anything more to 
do with slaveholders either here or in heaven. When 
my mother was sent away, I was brought up by my 
mistress, and used to call her mother; I didn't call her 
mistress, for I couldn't get the word into my mouth. I 
was raised in the house, and was a kind of nurse to the 
daughters of my owner. When I was fourteen or 
fifteen years old, I was sent into the field, and when I 
had learnt my work there, I was put over the other 
slaves and left to look after them when my master 
was away. I had to see the work done, and had to knock 
the other slaves about to make them do it. When I was 
about nineteen or twenty years old, I did what I 
suppose young men in this country do. I took the 
notion that I would go a courting. I did not want to 
marry a girl belonging to my own place, because I 
knew I could not bear to see her ill-treated. I had 
often thought of being free. An old man, who was
called Jacob, had many times talked with me about 
Canada, and I had talked with other slaves about starting
<pb id="ander130" n="130"/>
off for that place, and we had often formed plans 
for the purpose, but they were always disappointed. 
Well, about my marriage: there was a slave girl called 
Maria, she belonged to a man named Brown, and had 
been married when she was very young, and had two 
children, and her husband died, and I went to his 
funeral; I was then about twenty. You'll think it 
strange that I should be thinking of courtship and 
marriage at a funeral, but I couldn't help it, for I felt 
that I should very much like to have Maria for my wife; so six 
months after the funeral, I went with Maria to a camp meeting. 
Many slaves, who have no religion, go to camp 
meetings that they may be merry, for there is much 
whisky sold at these gatherings, and the people 
drink and play at cards, while others attend to religion. 
Maria was spoken to by her friends about going with 
me so soon after her husband's death. After that, I 
kept going to see her, and at last asked her if she would 
marry me. She said, ‘You must speak to my father<sic corr="'">,</sic>
and I did speak to him; and he said, ‘You had better 
wait awhile, and I'll see about it.’ I saw him again, 
and he still said, ‘wait awhile.’ When I told Maria, 
she said, ‘never mind, if he doesn't consent soon, we'll 
be married all the same.’ Lewis Tomlin (Maria's father) 
was a free man, who had purchased himself for eight 
hundred dollars, and had given six or seven hundred 
more for his wife. He had a little property, and was 
well to do as a barber, in the town of Fayette. So we 
got married, and Maria had a child seven or eight
<pb id="ander131" n="131"/>
months old when I ran away. Maria's first husband had
been dead about a year when we were married. It
was during the Christmas holidays. My master allowed
me to go and see my wife once a week—that is, on
Saturday night, and I was ordered to be back again
on Monday morning. I did not, however, care much
for his orders, and I used to go almost every
night. When we had been married about a year
and a half, Maria fell sick, and I wanted to go more
frequently to see her. My master would not permit
me, but I disobeyed him, and went. On one occasion
when I had been to see her, and had remained all night,
my master was on the look-out for me when I returned
in the morning. When he saw me, he said, ‘Jackey,
where have you been?’ I replied, ‘Oh, <sic corr="I've">Iv'e</sic> been walking
about.’ ‘I'll walk you about,’ he said, and came up
to me to give me a licking with a raw hide which he
had in his hand. I warded off his blows with my arm.
He then went and got a rope, and threw it over the
branch of an old walnut tree. I knew very well that
he wanted to tie me up and whip me, and I determined
that I would not be whipped. He ordered me to strip
and cross my hands, that I might be bound and drawn
up, but I refused. He cursed and swore, and threatened,
but I still refused. He then fetched his gun, and said
he would shoot me, but the daughter I had nursed when
in the house interposed, and got the gun away from him.
He then said he only wanted to frighten me, but that
he would sell me to some one who would break my
<pb id="ander132" n="132"/>
spirit. My mistress, who used to protect me, had been
dead for some time, and I had now no one to save me
from ill treatment. When she died, Burton made up his
mind to conquer me. One day after this he came home,
and not being pleased with me, ordered me to go into a
barn and receive punishment, but I refused. On this
occasion the daughters took part with their father, and
assisted him; but I got away, and escaped the punishment 
intended for me. Burton, not being able to subdue
me, hired me to a man of the name of Paterson. It was
while I was working for this man that my owner met
with McDonald, who lived thirty miles away, in Salem
county, on the other side of the Missouri river. This
man offered to buy me. He was already the owner of
about thirty slaves. When I came back to Burton's,
he came upon the farm to look at me, and to see what
sort of a hand I was, and how I went about my work.
He went away, and I remained with Burton about three
months longer, and, during that time, my master was
gradually appointing others to do the work I had been
accustomed to do. He did not, however, want me to
know that he had made a bargain with McDonald. It
was the season for cutting tobacco. I had raised about
twenty acres for Burton, and had about an acre and a
half of my own, which I had planted in the neighbourhood 
of my wife's residence. It was on a Saturday that
he told me I should do no more work for him, and that
he would hand me over to McDonald on the Monday
morning: so I resolved to make things square, and
<pb id="ander133" n="133"/>
accordingly went to Fayette and settled some accounts I 
had there, that I might be ready to start for my new 
home. On the Monday morning, when I saw the money 
paid for me, I said to Burton, ‘That' s a great deal of 
money, and I think you ought to give me some of it;’ 
but he made no reply. When my new master was
taking me across the river, he told the ferryman to take 
care that he never allowed me to recross it. About half 
way to his plantation McDonald stopped to take up his 
wife, who was waiting for him. He showed me to her
as the fine new slave he had just purchased. On the 
way he had a good deal to say to me about how he 
would serve me if I attempted to escape from him, and 
said, if I did, he would tie me up and cut me to pieces, 
and then send me to New Orleans. At the place where 
we took up McDonald's wife, I saw some slaves who 
appeared as if they were nearly starved, and when my 
dinner was sent out to me I gave it to them, in consequence 
of their hungry looks. Indeed, they seemed to 
have no strength for the work they had to do. I had 
never seen slaves in a worse condition. When we 
arrived at the plantation, McDonald told his slave-driver 
to let me off easy at the beginning, to coax me, and get 
me into the traces by degrees. I felt the separation 
from my wife very much, and made up my mind that, if 
I might not go and see her, I would run away for good; 
that I would get away some Sunday, and after bidding 
her good-bye, would start for Canada. That my master 
might be accustomed to miss me on a Sunday morning
<pb id="ander134" n="134"/>	
without suspecting that I had left him, I used to 
disappear on that day, but to show myself on Monday 
morning; so that he came at last to think that I did not 
go far away. When I had been with him about six 
months I asked to be allowed to go and see my wife, and 
bring back some clothes with me. He told me I should
never see my wife again; that he would not let me
cross the Missouri river any more, and that I must take 
one of his slave girls for my wife, for that his plantation 
would be my future home. Here, again, you see what 
kind of religion it is that the slaveholders possess: he 
wanted me to desert my wife and child, and become the 
father of children who should be his property. I knew 
he would refuse my request to go and see my wife, but
I determined to ask him, that I might have a fair excuse		
for leaving him. When he answered as he did, I said
nothing, but resolved that the approaching Sunday
should be my last in his service.” Anderson then
repeated, in his usual way, the account of his escape.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
        <head>JOHN ANDERSON AT CORBY.</head>
        <p>AFTER John Anderson had attended the various public
meetings referred to in the last chapter, the committee
felt it important that he should for a time devote himself
exclusively to the acquisition of learning, in order
to enable him to transact the ordinary business of life
creditably; and, with this view, he was placed under the
care of the Rev. J. G. Hewlett, D.D., in October, 1861.
It was evident, however, notwithstanding the Rev.
Doctor's care and vigilance, that Anderson's continuance
in London was unfavourable to that close attention to
his studies which was required to ensure
success; and when the excitement and attractiveness of
the sights and sounds of London to an untutored mind
are considered, it will readily be believed that Anderson
found it difficult to resist the various influences which,
in the Metropolis, combined to distract his thoughts and
attention. Under these circumstances, the committee
decided, in the month of December following, upon
placing Anderson with Mr. John Pool, of the British
<pb id="ander136" n="136"/>
Training Institution, Corby, near Thrapston, 
Northamptonshire, and, on the eighth of that month, Anderson 
was received into the household of Mr. Pool. The quiet 
and secluded character of this locality exerted a beneficial 
influence on Anderson, and it was speedily manifest 
that his withdrawal from the Metropolis was a desirable 
step, and that his progress would be as satisfactory as 
could be expected. The committee were favoured with 
periodical reports from Mr. Pool, conveying information 
of Anderson's studies; and in the month of July, 1862, 
that gentleman wrote as follows:—</p>
        <p>“In forming an estimate of the conduct and progress 
of Anderson since he has been with me, it is necessary 
to take into consideration his former mode of life, which 
was spent in severe labour, occasionally relieved by outdoor 
sports; the trying circumstances in which he was 
placed in Canada, and the season of excitement through 
which he passed on his arrival in England, as the natural 
consequences of which, he manifested on his first coming 
here considerable restlessness, which unfitted him for 
close application to his studies. This difficulty is, 
however, now in a great measure overcome; and I may 
say that it has been the greatest which I have had to 
encounter in superintending his education. On the 
whole, I think he has progressed as well as could be 
reasonably expected. He can now write very creditably, 
can read with little assistance a chapter in the New 
Testament, and can work the first four rules of arithmetic, 
both simple and compound.”</p>
        <pb id="ander137" n="137"/>
        <p>As a curious custom which prevails at Corby was
served during Anderson's residence in the village, it
may be not uninteresting to give some particulars
concerning it. It appears that Queen Elizabeth granted
the inhabitants of Corby a charter, to free them from
town toll throughout England, Wales, and Scotland;
also to exempt them from serving on juries at 
Northhampton, and to free the knights of the shire from
the militia law. In commemoration of the granting of the
charter, a festival, called the “Pole Fair,” is held on 
Whit-Monday once every twenty years, when the 
inhabitants assemble at an early hour and stop all roads
and byways in the parish, and demand a certain toll of
every person, gentle and simple, who may have occasion
to pass through the village on that day. In the case of
noncompliance, a stout pole is produced, and the obstinate
person is placed thereon in a riding attitude, and carried
around the village, followed by the jeers and laughter of 
the assembled crowds; and after that, he is taken to the
parish stocks and imprisoned, until the authorities choose
to grant a dismissal. The following is a copy of the 
ancient charter referred to, which is the possession of
the Rector of the parish:—</p>

        <p>The “Pole Fair” was held on Whit-Monday, June 
9th, 1862, and the following description of the ceremony, 
as then observed, was furnished to the <hi rend="italics">Stamford Mercury</hi> by Mr. Amos Bell, of Great Easton, who was throughout 
the day an eye-witness of what transpired:—</p>
        <p>“According to custom the inhabitants rose at an early 
hour, played and sang the National Anthem and Rule 
Britannia in the streets, and proclaimed the fair. They 
then began to carry on poles and chairs all the people 
in the village, put them in the stocks, and gave them 
some ale before liberating them from durance vile. 
Whole families were fetched out of their houses, and 
escorted to the stocks with flags flying, the band playing 
lively airs. After all the inhabitants had gone through 
the ceremony, strangers began to arrive in gigs, carts,
vans, and other vehicles, to witness this singular custom. 
They cheerfully paid the toll which was demanded of 
them on entering the village. Many hundred people 
were present, and a great many went through the ceremony.
<pb id="ander141" n="141"/>
Stalls, shooting-galleries, shows, and a large 
portable theatre rose up as if by magic, flags and
banners floated in the air, and the greatest hilarity 
prevailed. Parish officers, constables, and policemen 
went through the ceremony, no person being excused. 
Two good bands of music paraded the streets during the 
day. All the villagers tried to vie with each other in 
decorating their houses with devices, &amp;c. There was a 
pretty triumphal arch against the Exeter Arms inn: it 
exhibited the words ‘God save the Queen,’ and from 
which were suspended numerous flags, one containing 
the Corby cross. Altogether the decorations had an 
attractive appearance. Near the Cardigan Arms inn, 
opposite the stocks, was another large red, white, and 
blue flag, bearing the Corby cross. And above the 
stocks, on the wall, were the words ‘God save the 
Queen’ and ‘Our Charter’ in large characters. From 
the sign-post of the Cardigan Arms floated another large 
red, white, and blue flag, bearing the Corby cross; and 
from the sign to the house hung a handsome banner 
with a festooned wreath, bearing the motto ‘Long life 
to Cardigan,’ and on the other side ‘Honour to the 
brave.’ Against the White Horse inn was another 
triumphal arch, exhibiting the words ‘God save the
Queen’ and ‘Our Charter,’ and several flags. Against
the Black Horse inn was a pretty wreath extending
across the street, with a flag, and the words ‘God save
the Queen’ and ‘Our Charter.’ Against the Queen's
Head inn were two beautiful scarlet flags, and these,
<pb id="ander142" n="142"/>
with other decorations, had a pleasing effect. There 
were several handsome flags floating from private 
houses, particularly one from Mr. Chapman's, and 
another from Mr. Saddington's. On the Kettering-road 
was another triumphal arch, exhibiting the words ‘Our 
Charter’ and ‘God save the Queen,’ surmounted with 
three union jacks. On the Rockingham-road was 
another triumphal arch, with the words ‘Our Charter’
and ‘God save the Queen.’ On this arch were the flags 
of England, France, Sardinia, and Turkey. The 
business of the day was carried out with the best 
of good feelings, and the greatest hilarity prevailed till 
night threw her sable mantle over the proceedings.”</p>
        <p>John Anderson, who was a spectator, and was greatly 
interested in the proceedings of the day, was treated 
with the greatest kindness; and, as a mark of respect, 
he was graciously exempted from the payment of toll.</p>
        <p>During the remainder of the time that Anderson 
resided at Corby his progress in his studies was 
satisfactory to the Committee, and it is pleasing to 
remark that his conduct and deportment secured him the respect 
and esteem of those with whom he was brought into contact. 
It was intended that Anderson should reside with Mr. Pool 
for a period of twelve months; and as the period drew 
near for his removal from Corby, the Committee had 
many anxious consultations as to the course which his 
future life should take. In this emergency the Committee 
were indebted to F. W.
<pb id="ander143" n="143"/>
Chesson, Esq., the esteemed honorary secretary of the 
London Emancipation Society, for suggesting that the 
Negro Republic of Liberia would furnish unequalled 
opportunities for Anderson's prosperity and social 
advancement, and for kindly securing the co-operation 
of Gerald Ralston, Esq., the Consul-General of the 
Republic in England. After full consideration of the 
matter, it was ultimately resolved to recommend John 
Anderson to go out to Liberia; and Mr. Ralston having 
kindly made known the facts of the case to the Directors 
of the African Royal Mail Steam Ship Company, of 
79, Great Tower-street, the Board, in the most handsome 
manner, announced, through their secretary, Duncan 
Campbell, Esq., their willingness to grant Anderson a 
free passage to Liberia. The recommendation of the 
Committee having been conveyed to Anderson, with 
information as to the peculiar advantages which he would 
possess in the Republic, he decided to act upon it, and 
it was arranged that he should sail in the “Armenia,” on 
the 24th of December. It was also notified by Mr. 
Ralstan that the Liberian Government would make 
Anderson a special grant of land on his arrival in 
the Republic, so that he would at once become a landed 
proprietor and have a stake in the welfare of his 
adopted country—a generous concession which was 
highly valued.</p>
        <p>It will be seen by the following written testimonials, 
which were presented to Anderson previous to his 
departure from Corby, that he was generally esteemed
<pb id="ander144" n="144"/>
by the inhabitants of the village, during his residence 
there:—</p>

        <head>FAREWELL SOIREE TO JOHN ANDERSON.</head>
        <p>ON Monday evening, December 22nd, 1862, the 
members and friends of the “John Anderson 
Committee” held a farewell meeting at Shirley's Hotel, 
Queen's-square, London, previous to the departure of 
Anderson for the Republic of Liberia.</p>
        <p>Amongst the gentlemen present were Harper 
Twelvetrees, Esq., (chairman of the Committee); Cooke 
Baines, Esq., and Joseph A. Horner, Esq., the Honorary 
Secretaries; Rev. J. G. Hewlett, D.D., F. W. Chesson, 
Esq.; J. Noble, Esq., jun.; W. Farmer, Esq.; Professor 
W. G. Allen, M.A., (a gentleman of colour); Stephen 
Shirley, Esq.; Messrs. Pool, Eaton, C. Bell, Ford, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
        <p>After tea, Mr. Twelvetrees was called upon to occupy 
the chair, and the Rev. Dr. Hewlett having opened the 
meeting with prayer,</p>
        <p>The CHAIRMAN stated that they had met for the purpose 
of congratulating John Anderson on the present 
favourable circumstances in his history, and also to 
assure him of their best wishes for his success in the path 
which Providence had opened up for him. He (the
<pb id="ander148" n="148"/>		
Chairman) felt sure that he was only uttering the desires 
of every member of the committee and of all present when 
he said, that they earnestly desired for their friend and 
brother the enjoyment of every blessing which a bountiful 
and beneficent God might see fit to bestow; that he might 
be prosperous and successful in his new sphere of duty 
and labour; and be spared many years to enjoy the 
reward of his industry in the land of his adoption. It 
was somewhat more than eighteen months since John 
Anderson trod on English soil as a trembling fugitive. 
His public reception in London must have convinced 
him that, although he had had a run for life and liberty, 
he had at last distanced his oppressors, and was beyond 
the power of those who thirsted for his blood. Since 
the meeting at Exeter Hall, at which the committee was formed, 
he felt sure that no pains or exertion had been spared 
by the committee to promote his welfare and 
forward his interests. Their task had not been an easy 
one. (Hear.) It had been a matter of considerable 
anxiety to decide upon the best course to adopt for 
enabling Anderson to gain his livelihood, and become an 
industrious, respected and useful citizen. Many 
gentlemen present would remember that, at the time of 
Anderson's arrival in England, the country was in a 
state of excitement respecting the man who had been 
the subject of Colonial dispatches and interdicts from 
the Home Office, and that Anderson was, day by day, 
receiving temporary offers from speculators of various 
classes; and had it not been for the influence and
<pb id="ander149" n="149"/>
control of the committee, he would have fallen a prey 
to designing men, who would have bargained with him
for using the sorrowful incidents of his life for trading 
upon the sympathies of the public. (Hear.) If the 
committee had done nothing else, there was cause for 
gratitude that they had been enabled to preserve 
Anderson from contributing to the gratification of 
sightseers, and leading a worse than useless life. (Hear, 
hear.) After a few public meetings had been held, 
which were attended by a deputation from the committee, 
consisting of the Rev. J. G. Hewlett, D.D.; 
George Thompson, Esq,; John Noble, Esq., jun.; it 
was deemed advisable to withdraw Anderson from 
public life, and decline all invitations for him to attend 
public meetings. The committee at that period were 
indebted to the Rev. Dr. Hewlett, who kindly engaged 
to receive Anderson under his roof, and devote his 
time and attention to his mental, moral, and religious 
cultivation. Subsequently, in order to withdraw him 
from the excitement occasioned by his residence in 
the metropolis, Anderson was placed under the care 
of Mr. John Pool, of the British Training Institution, 
Corby, where he had gradually progressed 
in his studies, and prepared himself for the discharge 
of the duties which devolved upon him as a responsible 
member of society. As Anderson's period of instruction 
drew near to its close, the anxiety of the committee was 
again awakened as to his future employment and mode 
of life; and in this emergency they accepted the kind
<pb id="ander150" n="150"/>	
offer of the services of Mr. F. W. Chesson, who 
promised to solicit of Gerard Ralston, Esq., 
Consul-General of Liberia, and the African Mail Company, 
respectively, a grant of land, and a free passage to that 
important and thriving negro Republic, which, as they
were aware, had been most generously granted. Liberia 
was a respectable commonwealth, on the Coast of 
Guinea, numbering about 500,000 souls, where the
American flag was hoisted in the year 1822. The climate 
was admirably adapted to Anderson's southern constitution; 
and the country produced rice, Indian corn, cotton, 
indigo, pepper, ginger, palm-oil, arrowroot, pine-apples, 
tamarinds, and every species of tropical produce which
afforded ample supplies for the residents, and for the 
demands of shipping. As Anderson had been a farmer 
and had the management of crops for his former masters, 
the experience he had gained would be serviceable to 
him in conducting his own affairs; and he (the Chairman) 
trusted some day to hear of him as a prosperous and 
wealthy settler in the “land of promise” to the negro. 
He had now an opportunity of making for himself a 
respectable position in life, for he was going out under 
the most favourable auspices—with recommendations 
and introductions to the principal officers of state in the
Republic; and, as his present wants were provided for 
and his future wants guarded against, he (the Chairman) 
trusted that, with God's blessing on his exertions, 
he would rise to respectability and independence. All 
that remained for them was to congratulate him on
<pb id="ander151" n="151"/>
the auspicious opening that presented itself, and wish
him God speed in his future career: and if he should be 
prosperous in his undertakings, and become a large 
employer of labour and acquire considerable property, 
he (the Chairman) trusted he would honour the Lord 
with his substance, and enjoy the favour and the blessing 
of Him who has said, “They that honour me I will honour.” (Cheers.)</p>
        <p>COOKE BAINES, Esq. (one of the Honorary Secretaries), 
after reading letters of apology from the Honourable 
Arthur Kinnaird, M.P., George Thompson, 
Esq., Rev. C. J. Middleditch, Rev. Thomas Jones, and 
other gentlemen who had been invited to the meeting, 
proceeded to read the following communications, which
he had received from Gerard Ralston, Esq., Consul-General

good health, he will be sure to succeed, and become a 
useful citizen of the Republic, provided he exercise

he will find his compatriots in power, and his own

abundance of natural wealth in Liberia; and only capital
and skilled labour are required to develope it. I have no 
doubt Mr. Anderson will be a most useful immigrant, 
and, I trust, he will be a successful one. Wishing

        <p>The Rev. J. G. HEWLETT, D.D., then rose and delivered 
the valedictory address, as follows:—</p>
        <p>“Allow me to assure you, John Anderson, that it is 
my firm conviction that the course which the Committee 
has adopted, in selecting Liberia as the sphere of your 
future action, is the best which, under all circumstances, 
could be adopted. I express a confident hope that, in 
a very short time, you will prove that you have now a 
broad and firm basis on which your future and temporal 
prosperity and happiness may be reared. You will find in 
Liberia a land of peace and liberty—a home where you 
will not be disturbed by the slave-hunter, or in any other 
way be in danger of losing your liberty. You go to be 
acknowledged as a free citizen of that Republic, where 
the offices of state will be open to you according to your 
qualifications and merits. I trust you will not forget, 
that the influence of your conduct and character will 
have great weight in either confirming the prejudices of 
some against men of colour, or in showing that those 
prejudices are false and slanderous. Let it be seen 
that your race are capable of becoming honourable 
and useful members of any community into which they 
may be received. You, dear friend, are now beginning 
life afresh. You are starting under peculiar advantages 
if you will turn those advantages to the best account. 
You are going to a country where a sphere of active 
exertion is marked out for you. You go neither as a 
pauper nor as a slave. You go with letters of introductions 
and recommendations, of which many European
<pb id="ander155" n="155"/>
emigrants would be proud. You go with introductions to 
those of the highest official station in that land of your 
adoption. You go with all the benefit of past experience. 
You know yourself a little better than you did some 
time ago; you know the temptations to which you are 
exposed; and you know those which are likely to act 
most powerfully for your injury, and you are, in some 
measure, prepared to shun or resist them. All you know 
you will require to bring to bear upon your daily 
practice. And, after all, the knowledge of the past 
should stimulate to greater and future exertions. Let 
me advise you still to persevere in the acquisition of 
knowledge, and the improvement of your intellect. As 
yet you have but the elements of knowledge. Give
daily attention to your moral and spiritual nature.
Spend a portion of every day in communion with God
and with your own heart. If the Spirit of God has
commenced his work of regeneration, you need to pray
for his continued help.	Combine watchfulness with
prayer; for prayer without watchfulness is hyprocrisy,
as watchfulness without prayer would be presumption.
Be careful in choosing your friends. Do not readily
think that every one who speaks to you smooth things
and flattering words is your friend. He is not your
friend who would say or do anything to divert you
from the path of duty, though he should make great
professions of friendship. He is your friend who would
urge you on to higher and higher attainments, both in
knowledge and holiness. He is your friend who will
<pb id="ander156" n="156"/>
kindly point out your failings, and gently administer
reproof when needed, because he keeps your best 
interests in view. And though you are going to a far
distant country, you will always have a place in the
memory, and an interest in the prayers, of many in this
country. I am sure I speak the sentiments of the
gentlemen by whom I am surrounded, when I say, we
shall keep you constantly in our remembrance. You
know we have taken a deep interest in your welfare;
you have often acknowledged that in my hearing; and
we assure you that that interest will not be diminished
but greatly increased, when we think of you in a foreign
land. We shall, at all times and in all circumstances, be
gratified to hear from you, and nothing would so
contribute to raise that gratification to its highest height, as
the knowledge that, by God's blessing, you were
prospering, and that you were advancing in honour and
wealth for time, and preparing for the blessedness of
eternity. While I am very far from ignoring the
blessing of Providence, on the contrary, desire earnestly
that you may seek and obtain it; yet there is a sense
in which your future must, to a great extent, depend on
yourself to complete what has been begun for you.
Much will depend on your own exertions. You will, on
your arrival in Liberia, be put in possession of five acres
of land. By bringing your experience to agricultural
pursuits, and by persevering in industrious toil, you may
soon make this land a source of wealth. From all I
can learn, the production of Liberia being cotton,
<pb id="ander157" n="157"/>
tobacco, pimento, and others, like those of Missouri, the 
country from which you fled, I conclude the climate 
must be somewhat similar, and therefore suited to your 
health and constitution; and the soil similar, and therefore 
requiring the same culture. In your experience of the 
cultivation of cotton, tobacco, pepper, &amp;c., you 
have a capital you may at once employ to advantage. 
Though it is not for any of us to look into the future, 
yet I do venture to predict that, if you will but attend 
to the good advice which you have received from many 
here present, you will ere long become a holder of large 
tracts of land, and an employer of many labourers. 
Should this be the case, let your remembrance of the 
horrors of slavery induce you ever to treat men as men, 
and not as goods or cattle. Remember the sacred rights 
of humanity, and never tyrannize over your fellow-men. 
I will add but one more remark, and that is, let me 
advise you at all times to be frank and truthful. Be 
careful what you say. Let your words be not only 
so plain that they may be understood, but so plain that 
they cannot be misunderstood. Let neither your words 
or actions be a just cause of suspicion. Maintain the 
high character of an honest man and a Christian. Make 
the position in which the letter of the Consul-General 
is intended to place you, a stepping-stone to one yet 
higher. And now may the blessing of God rest upon 
you, guide and protect you through all the scenes that 
await you, and prepare you for the happiness of the life 
to come. Farewell!</p>
        <pb id="ander158" n="158"/>
        <p>The Rev. Gentleman was repeatedly applauded during
the delivery of his address, which he concluded by
moving the following resolution:—</p>
        <p>“That this meeting expresses its earnest desire for
the prosperity and happiness of John Anderson in the
Republic of Liberia, of which he is about to become	
a free citizen beyond the reach of the man-stealer.”		</p>
        <p>JOHN NOBLE, jun., Esq., said, he had very great
pleasure in seconding the resolution. When John
Anderson first came to this country the committee had
taken him by the hand, had maintained and educated
him, and thus put him in the way of obtaining a position
far above that of many of their own countrymen. He
would not be a mere hewer of wood and drawer of
water in the land to which he was going, he would
commence his career as a landed-proprietor. (Hear,
hear.) If he had fallen into other hands he would
probably have become a dock-labourer, or occupied
some other position equally low in the social scale. 
Instead of this, he was about to sail for Liberia, a land
which he might call one of experiment, for it was so in
reality,—a state created for the purpose of demonstrating
to the world that the negro race could govern themselves
and dwell in a civilized community as well as the
white race—(cheers);—that, as a race, they are not
distinct in nature from ourselves; but can govern and
conduct themselves in a manner to show that they enjoy
and appreciate the blessing of civilization. He (Mr. 
Noble) looked upon that experiment, in view of the
fearful crime of slavery, as one of the most encouraging
	
<pb id="ander159" n="159"/>
and satisfactory character. It had been said that the
negro race was an inferior one; that it was necessary to
keep them in some kind of bondage; that they would
not work, and could not exist in freedom. The Republic
of Liberia is an attempt to answer such allegations; it
was, so to speak, the first instance of a negro community
existing under similar conditions to those of the white
races. This laid a deep responsibility upon John
Anderson and his future fellow-citizens,—that in this
first attempt at self-government they should conclusively
refute the assertions of the slave-owners. If this
experiment should fail, with it the hopes of the entire
negro race will fail also: if it is successful, no limit need
be placed to restrict them in the enjoyment of the
uttermost possible liberty. (Cheers.) He trusted that
John Anderson would feel that upon his behaviour in his
newly-adopted country would depend, in some degree,
the future destiny of the entire negro race; and that
the committee who, though separated by distance, would
ever hear of his welfare with joy, would find their
reward in his being a sober, prosperous, and respectable
citizen of the free community of Liberia. (Hear, hear.)
He went forth under the best auspices, with such
introductions to the court and government of Liberia, as
the son of the proudest nobleman would receive; and
the committee had no doubt that, in future years, when
he had become a wealthy and prosperous citizen, that
John Anderson would feel that the present step was the
wisest that could be taken for his permanent
well-being. (Applause)</p>
        <pb id="ander160" n="160"/>
        <p>PROFESSOR W. G. ALLEN, M.A., next addressed the 
meeting, and said that he could only reiterate what Mr. 
Noble had said, for that gentleman had touched upon 
the very points which he intended to present to their 
notice. As a man of colour, he could only thank them 
for what they had done on behalf of John Anderson. 
He naturally felt, belonging as he did to the same race, 
a deep interest in John Anderson's welfare. Anderson 
might think, perhaps, that he was going to a cold and 
cheerless country, but it was not so; he was going to 
one of the finest in the world. He (Professor Allen) 
had often thought of the history of Old Africa; and 
grand and glorious as that history was, he believed her 
future was destined to be grander and more glorious still, 
because, elevated by the genius and power of Christianity. 
The world moves upwards—Ethiopia, Egypt, and 
Carthage, were great indeed, but Liberia was 
destined to be greater. There was one conclusion, however, 
that must force itself upon their minds—Africa could 
only become great again by the capacity of Africans to 
make her so. It was for the African race to vindicate 
themselves from the calumnies of their oppressors. 
(Hear, hear.) They ought not to complain of the blows 
they received, but gather strength to prevent them. 
Any race that was down would sure to be well abused. 
As for Liberia, from all he could gather, and he had 
paid much attention to the subject, he believed it to be 
a beautiful country. Its climate was healthy, and it 
was rich in natural resources. The society in Monrovia 
was good, and there was much that was even elegant
<pb id="ander161" n="161"/>
and refined. He recollected when he was in America, 
he, in common with most coloured people, imbibed a 
strong prejudice against the place when it was first talked 
of. They saw no reason why they should be deported 
from the places in which they were born. Entertaining 
the same opinion still, that the blacks have as good a 
right to remain in America or elsewhere as the whites, 
he had, nevertheless, come to look upon Liberia as 
established by an over-ruling Providence for good, and 
did not care now to go into the motive of its founders. 
He felt that there were strong reasons to congratulate
himself, John Anderson, and his race, that there existed 
this green and inviting spot. Thither he hoped John 
Anderson would go, and carry with him all the courage 
and energy of his character. He had given some proofs 
that he possessed these attributes. (Hear, hear.) He 
(the Professor) hoped he would never be called upon to 
show them in the same way again, but in a milder and 
more Christian spirit. (Cheers.) Depend upon it (he 
reiterated) Africa has a glorious future before her. 
Greece was made illustrious by her arts and literature 
—Rome, by her jurisprudence and military spirit—
England and America, by their commercial and industrial 
enterprises. It remained then, for another race 
to illustrate the milder genius and more amiable qualities 
of human character, and that he believed to be the 
destiny of poor, down-trodden, despised Africa. He 
rejoiced in Liberia. In speaking of the African race, 
however, he must not forget to pay a passing tribute to Hayti.
<pb id="ander162" n="162"/>
Here was a nation of Africans in the western world, that 
had already illustrated the highest qualities of statesmanship 
and military genius, as the history of Toussaint 
L'Ouverture and his noble compeers clearly showed—a 
nation of men, that had not only shown that they knew 
their rights and were determined to maintain them, but 
who, under the lead of the wise and humane Geffrard, 
were further destined to show forth the entire capacity 
of the African for self-government. All honour therefore 
to Hayti. But, while not honouring Hayti less, he 
must say that he was profoundly interested in the 
continent of Africa, its magnificent country, its innumerable 
and splendid aboriginal races, and it was on this 
account he felt a peculiar interest in Liberia. He 
believed it to be the beginning of a glorious end. Ethiopia 
was about to stretch out her hands unto God. Jehovah 
who had smitten Egypt was now about to heal her. 
The darkness was giving way to the light. The 
mystery of the mysterious land was about to be solved. 
(Applause.) If his family relations would permit it, he 
did not know but what he should have gone to Liberia 
himself. But his wife objected to that course, and as 
he could not get a divorce for that, he supposed he must 
stay where he was. (Laughter.) Well, then, he would 
recommend his friend John Anderson to think of the 
history of Africa, and to work for her future glory, and 
he wished him in his new home, prosperity and 
happiness. (Applause. )</p>
        <p>The resolution was then put and carried unanimously.</p>
        <pb id="ander163" n="163"/>
        <p>JOHN ANDERSON, who was received with applause,
said he was sure he had to thank the Chairman, the
Committee, and friends, for their kindness to him, and 
he hardly knew how to do so as he ought. The remarks 
which had been made by his coloured friend, Professor 
Allen, had struck him very much. He at one time 
felt a great prejudice against Liberia—against even the 
very name of it,—but what he had since heard about it, 
had removed that prejudice altogether. (Hear, hear.)
He was sure a debt of gratitude was due to the gentlemen 
who formed the committee, especially the Chairman, 
Mr. Harper Twelvetrees, for he had done double—
(cheers and laughter),—then Mr. J. A. Horner, Mr. 
Cooke Baines, Mr. George Thompson, Mr. Chesson, 
and Mr. John Noble. (Hear, hear.) All of them had 
been very kind to him. He hardly knew what to say to 
show the gratitude he felt at what had been done for 
him. He regretted that his going away so soon would
prevent him from calling upon many other friends whom 
he wanted to see before he left England. He had found 
many friends here who had been very kind to him. 
Through the kindness of the committee, he had been 
able to learn a little; and now he felt a desire to know 
more. He wished he had begun earlier, but he was 
glad that he had laid a good foundation for the future. 
(Cheers.) Some of the gentlemen had said to him that 
he might some day be President of Liberia. He 
thought he should want a little more instruction in many 
branches of knowledge. At any rate, he trusted that
<pb id="ander164" n="164"/>
their efforts for his improvement would not be in vain.
(Hear, hear.) He did not know how he could repay
them for their kindness to him; but he hoped the Lord
would bless each and every one of them for what they
had done for him. His privileges had been certainly
very great. He had received much sympathy and
assistance from the good and intelligent people of
England; and that was why he regretted leaving them.
He felt that he was going out to Liberia under great
advantages. From all he could learn it seemed a good
sort of place. When he first went to Canada he
had not a friend in the world; but through God's
providence he soon got plenty, and by the same
aid he would try to succeed in Liberia. (Cheers.)
His condition might have been much worse. As a slave
he had seen much suffering and distress. He sometimes
thought that no man in the world had gone through so
many troubles as he had; but he supposed every man
thought the same who had any troubles to bear.
(Laughter.) He was sure they would admit that his 
afflictions had been great. (Hear.) He had left his poor wife
and child in slavery—sometimes he entertained the hope
of seeing them again; but the difficulties were so great
that the thought vanished. God would, however,
watch over them and protect them. He should have
liked to have stopped at school another year, so as to
have increased his stock of learning; but he was very
thankful to the committee and the English people for
what they had already done for him. He was happy
<pb id="ander165" n="165"/>
to say that he could now read the Scriptures, and he
never imagined that they contained the glorious truths 
which they did. (Cheers.) In writing he could begin 
to put the letters together and that was something. 
(Hear and laughter.) For these blessings he must 
thank them all; Mr. Harper Twelvetrees first, and 
above all the rest, because he had done the most (hear hear); 
then the two Secretaries, Mr. Cooke Baines and 
Mr. Horner; the Committee; and then the English people. 
(Cheers.) When he arrived at Liberia he would write 
to them, and he hoped they would answer his letters. 
It would pain him if he wrote to them as well as he 
could and got no answer to his letters. Dr. Hewlett 
had advised him to speak plainly. He was afraid that 
was a great fault of his, (laughter) he thought he spoke
exceedingly plain; but if he spoke too plainly he hoped 
they would pardon him. The Bible told them to go 
and “reason together,” and he was willing to reason 
with any man, even a slave-dealer, provided he did not 
lay hands upon him. But if the slave-dealer would not 
keep his hands off he would warn him off; and if he 
still persisted in laying hands upon him he would strike 
for life and liberty. In conclusion he thanked them 
for all they had kindly done for him, which he should 
remember to his dying hour. (Cheers.)</p>
        <p>F.  W. CHESSON, Esq., Secretary of the Aborigines' 
Protection Society, proposed the following resolution:—</p>
        <p>“That this Meeting tenders its cordial thanks to 
Gerard Ralston, Esq., Consul-General of Liberia, for the
<pb id="ander166" n="166"/>
trouble he has taken on John Anderson's behalf, in 
arranging for his passage to, and settlement in, the 
Republic of Liberia; that the thanks of this Meeting 
are due, and are hereby given to the Chairman and 
Directors of the West African Mail Packet Company, 
for their kindness in granting a passage to John 
Anderson at almost a nominal rate; and that this Meeting 
earnestly prays for the prosperity of the important 
Negro State, of which Mr. Ralston is the representative 
in this country.”</p>
        <p>He (Mr. Chesson) moved this resolution with peculiar 
pleasure, as he had for many years been on terms of 
intimacy with Mr. Ralston, and could render emphatic 
testimony to the great and disinterested services which that 
gentleman had rendered to Liberia. He knew, from what 
had been told him by persons high in authority, that those 
services were fully appreciated by both the government 
and people of Liberia; and, although the negro race was 
now necessarily, in a great measure, ignorant of Mr. 
Ralston's efforts for their benefit, he believed the time 
would come when millions of this suffering people 
would mention his name with gratitude, and honour him 
as one who rejoiced to identify himself with them in the 
days of their humiliation and servitude. (Cheers.) 
The establishment of an independent and civilized negro 
state on the West Coast of Africa was a fact full of hope 
for the people of that continent. Liberia was the one 
little oasis in the wilderness, but the oasis would extend, 
and the whole land would one day smile with fertility.
<pb id="ander167" n="167"/>
Wherever Liberian influence might extend, the evils of 
fetishism, sorcery, and domestic slander would speedily 
disappear, and their place be taken by purer customs 
and a higher faith. (Hear, hear.) For several years 
past he had anxiously watched the policy of the Liberian 
government, and he was bound to say, that there was 
nothing in that policy to which he could take exception; 
and that, when they were involved in difficulties with 
Spain and England of a character more or less grave, 
they acted with remarkable wisdom. He had been much 
gratified with one remark that had fallen from John 
Anderson—he said that he wished to acquire still further 
education; that what he had learnt made him desire to 
learn still more. (Hear, hear.) That was a desire worthy 
to be encouraged, and one of the noblest that could be 
implanted in the human mind. He (Mr. Chesson) was 
glad to say that he would find in his new home many men 
of his own race who were actuated by the same sentiment; 
and what was of equal importance, he would find the most 
ample opportunities for its gratification. In Monrovia, 
the capital of the Republic, there was a splendid college, 
which had its professors, who were men of learning and 
high attainments. At least, one of them, the Rev. 
Alexander Crummell, had graduated at Cambridge 
University, and had entered holy orders as a clergyman 
of the English Church. Let John Anderson, in going 
to Liberia, be encouraged by what individual Liberians 
had done for their own improvement and elevation. 
There was President Benson himself, a native of Maryland,
<pb id="ander168" n="168"/>
who went to the country of which he was now the 
chief magistrate, at the age of seven years, and who
never once left the shores of Africa until he visited 
Europe a few months ago. He received his entire 
education at the grammar-school of Monrovia; and yet 
he (Mr. Chesson) had the privilege of hearing him address 
public audiences in this country, in language of the 
purest English, and on all occasions he proved himself 
to be an accomplished and well-informed gentleman, fit 
to take his place in any assembly in the world. (Cheers.) 
He might also mention Mr. ex-President Roberts, one of 
the pillars of the state, between whom and his successor 
no petty rivalry existed. Chief-Justice Drayton, who 
came from South Carolina—a state in which teaching a 
slave to read is an offence punishable with imprisonment 
and death. Mr. Secretary Johnson, whose letters in 
the <hi rend="italics">Liberian Herald,</hi> describing his visit to England, 
were as lively and vigorous as the speeches he delivered 
in this country: and many other bright examples of self-made 
men. He did not say that John Anderson should 
expect or ever hope to take his place among men 
occupying this position. Every man was not born to 
rule or guide the ship of state; but the ability was given 
to every educated and intelligent human being to live a 
life of public usefulness and of private rectitude. (Hear, 
hear.) By all means let John Anderson aspire, but he should 
first lay down a basis of knowledge—devote himself 
sedulously to his own mental improvement and to 
those industrial pursuits in which he would shortly
<pb id="ander169" n="169"/>
engage. (Applause.) If, as the result of his exertions,
he should only secure in acquiring a reputation as a
brave and honest citizen, those in this country who had
interested themselves in his welfare, and who would still
continue to watch his career, would be abundantly
rewarded for all their labour, and would never have
cause to regret that they had been the means of giving
him his new start in life. (Cheers.) He desired to say
one word more on the subject of negro self-government.
It should not be forgotten that there was another state
besides Liberia, in which the children of Africa were
exhibiting the highest capacity of civilized men. He
referred to Hayti, where ex-President Geffrard was
ruling with a benignity and wisdom which found few
parallels in older states; and be rejoiced to know that
this noble Republic and its African sister were united
by a treaty of commerce and amity—a treaty which, he
believed, had been first suggested by himself to a former
Haytian minister in London. He was sure that this 
international bond would prove enduring, because it was
the growth of mutual confidence, respect, and good-will. 
(Applause.) 	</p>
        <p>WILLIAM FARMER, Esq., in seconding the resolution, 
said that he could endorse all that had been said by 
his friend, Mr. Chesson, respecting the State of Liberia. 
He had not the privilege of an acquaintance with 
Mr. President Benson, but from all he had read of him, 
he believed him to be fully entitled to the commendations 
which had been passed upon him. (Hear, hear.<corr sic="missing punctuation">)</corr>
<pb id="ander170" n="170"/>
He (Mr. Farmer) had at one time shared in the prejudice 
entertained by the free-coloured people against the
Republic of Liberia, but he was glad to notice an 
improved state of opinion on this subject, and that the 
experiment of forming a negro commonwealth was no 
longer considered a degradation, but a blessing to the
coloured race. He was also gratified with the observation 
of John Anderson as to his desire for further 
instruction—it was a noble sentiment; and he had no 
doubt, that with his present acquirements, he would 
endeavour to educate himself and attain greater 
proficiency in knowledge. One of the most distinguished 
men of his race, Frederick Douglas, was a self-educated 
man, (cheers,) who did not even possess the advantages 
which John Anderson did, but by his own untiring efforts 
rose to his present eminent position; and some of the 
most remarkable men in our own country were 
self-educated men, who had raised themselves from a 
comparatively humble position, to eminence, by their 
own exertions. William Cobbett had taught himself to 
read while keeping sentry; and he (Mr. Farmer) had 
heard that eloquent friend of the slave, George Thompson, 
state from the hustings, that he had never received 
a day's schooling in his life. These were only a few 
instances of self-educated men, but the number could be 
multiplied at pleasure. John Anderson was about to 
assume a responsible position as a representative man. 
The Republic of Liberia would have much to do with 
the future history of America, inasmuch, as its progress
<pb id="ander171" n="171"/>
would exert a powerful influence upon the question 
of the liberty of the slave in that unhappy country. 
He would be put in possession of a grant of land on his 
arrival at the country that was to be his future home, 
and thus he would enjoy an advantage which he 
(Mr. Farmer) did not possess. John Anderson had a 
good physical constitution, and also a <sic corr="knowledge">knowlege</sic> of 
farming in a tropical climate; and therefore he was in 
a better position for ensuring success than many others 
on their arrival in a new country. (Cheers.) The 
resolution was then unanimously adopted.</p>
        <p>COOKE BAINES, Esq. next proposed the following resolution:— </p>
        <p>“That this meeting expresses its warm approval 
of the manner in which the Rev. Dr. Hewlett and 
Mr. John Pool conducted the education of John 
Anderson during the time he was under the charge of 
those gentlemen.”</p>
        <p>Mr. Baines stated that they had only to run their 
eyes over the evidences that he had then before 
him to find abundant testimony of the value of the 
instruction which had been imparted to Anderson. 
When John Anderson first came to this country he did 
not feel even the desire for instruction, and if the 
gentlemen referred to in the resolution had only succeeded 
in implanting that one idea in his mind during the 
twelvemonths he had been with them, they had accomplished 
something worthy of their warmest praise. 
(Hear, hear.) When John Anderson arrived in Liberia
<pb id="ander172" n="172"/>
he would more fully appreciate the value of the instruction 
he had already received, for the little knowledge 
he possessed would assist him to more, if the desire for 
further instruction remained. In the Negro Republic 
he would find many friends willing to assist and encourage 
him, if he manifested a becoming disposition, united 
with perseverance and energy. He might not live to 
become President of Liberia, nor might he be able to 
attain a very exalted position in that free republic, but 
he could and ought to strive to become a good, useful 
and respectable citizen of his adopted country. (Cheers.) 
He was going to a country where his colour was not a 
mark of degradation; and he (Mr. Baines) felt bound 
to express the sincerest hopes of his warmest friends 
that his future course of life would show that he was 
worthy of his freedom. (Cheers.)</p>
        <p>JOSEPH A. HORNER, Esq., in seconding the resolution 
said, that in his position as one of the Honorary 
Secretaries to the Committee he had had ample 
opportunities of judging of the progress that John 
Anderson had made, by the letters received from him, 
from time to time. During his sojourn in London there 
were circumstances known to the Committee which 
prevented him from making that progress in his studies, 
which he otherwise would have done. At Corby, however, 
he not only enjoyed the advantages of being under 
an able instructor like Mr. Pool, but also the benefit of 
seclusion and quiet while engaged in the acquisition of 
knowledge. He had also the advantage of the personal
<pb id="ander173" n="173"/>
sympathies of Mr. Pool himself, who had always been
a warm friend of the Anti-Slavery movement. Mr. Pool
would tell them that Anderson had conducted himself
honourably, and that he should never desire a more
tractable pupil; (cheers) and he was sure the Committee
had reason to congratulate themselves in having secured
such a guardian for John Anderson as that gentleman
had proved himself during the last twelve months.
John Anderson had expressed in their hearing that
night his wish to become a missionary. He (Mr.
Horner), regarded Liberia as one of the most promising
missionary enterprises of the day, and his life could be
consecrated to the service and glory of God in a republic
which was itself a grand missionary field. There were
half a million of coloured people among whom he might
labour, where his colour instead of being a disadvantage
would prove a recommendation. (Hear, hear.) The noble
examples alluded to by Mr. Chesson were calculated
to encourage him in his efforts, when he should become
the citizen of a state which was not only free, but based
upon elevating and Christian principles, and one in
which the black man could attain the highest office of
the Republic. (Cheers.) John Anderson had cause
to rejoice in his removal to a country where a black
face was more popular than a white one. He (Mr.
Horner) was almost afraid that Anderson would soon
imbibe a prejudice against white men. (Laughter.) In
Liberia the colour of the skin was the qualification of
citizenship, and not the mark of slavery. John
<pb id="ander174" n="174"/>
Anderson must endeavour to combat with that 
prejudice if he found it growing upon him, (increased laughter) 
and he also trusted that he would keep his friends 
acquainted with his progress by frequently writing to 
them. Speaking for himself he would cheerfully undertake 
to answer all the letters with which he might be 
favoured. Anderson would not be very far away 
from them—only twenty-one days sail, and he wished 
him all prosperity in his newly-adopted country. (Applause.)</p>
        <p>The resolution was then submitted to the meeting and adopted.</p>
        <p>MR. JOHN POOL, of Corby, in responding, expressed 
his thanks for their recognition of his humble services. 
There was always a satisfaction in doing one's duty, but 
the satisfaction he then experienced was increased 
considerably by the knowledge that his labours were 
appreciated by those on whose behalf they had been 
undertaken. When John Anderson first came to him, 
he (Mr. Pool) felt that he was a representative man, and 
that a deep responsibility rested upon him (Mr. Pool), 
for if he should not succeed with Anderson as he desired, 
he should thus be the occasion of disappointing the 
expectations of the Committee; and <sic corr="original printing error">thef riends</sic> of slavery 
would refer to their failure, and henceforth speak in 
tones of contempt of the efforts of abolitionists. (Hear, 
hear.) Being cradled in the principles of abolition, he 
(Mr. Pool) was actuated by a feeling of sympathy and 
interest in his work, and he believed that his success
<pb id="ander175" n="175"/>
with Anderson would be destined to exert an influence 
upon the interests of the coloured race throughout 
the world. (Cheers.) He was, therefore, happy to 
say that the result had been of the most satisfactory 
character. He left the parish of Corby without a 
stain upon his character—a general favourite with 
all classes; while the testimonials of the various 
ministers of religion of all denominations, showed that 
he had gained their confidence and goodwill. (Hear, 
hear.) Anderson had abstained from public speaking, 
in accordance with the instructions of the Committee, 
until the previous week, when, as he was preparing to 
leave the neighbourhood, he was allowed to narrate the 
history of his escape to the rustics of the village. The 
excitement connected with his arrival in England greatly 
unfitted him for much mental progress. By degrees, 
however, his temperament had become subdued; and 
the progress he had since made was of the most satisfactory 
character. His last letter to Mr. Horner was 
indited and written entirely by himself. He could read 
a chapter in the New Testament without hesitating at a 
word, unless it should be an extraordinary long word. 
He could also understand the sense and meaning of what 
he read, and has been able to master the first four rules 
in arithmetic—simple and compound, and make out a 
simple bill of account correctly. (Cheers.) As regarded 
Anderson's general conduct, the longer he remained 
with him the more it improved; so that he could not help 
feeling gratified that he was leaving them under such
<pb id="ander176" n="176"/>
auspicious circumstances; and if he ever rose to an 
eminent position, he should recollect with pleasure the 
part he had taken in preparing him for his future career. 
Anderson's future conduct would prove whether their 
exertions to promote his well-being had been appreciated 
or not; and he hoped he would ever maintain an 
honourable and useful position in life that could be 
referred to with satisfaction by his friends. He must 
not be content with a character built only upon the 
sandy foundation of fame and notoriety, but upon the 
solid foundation of knowledge and Christian principles, 
which had been already laid. He was not deficient in 
mental capacity, and might reasonably be expected to 
exert a wide influence for good in the country to which 
he was going. He would be a representative man, to 
strengthen or weaken the position of his coloured 
brethren still in bondage. He would go from this 
country the pioneer of emancipated slavery, to demonstrate 
to the world that the coloured race are capable of 
governing themselves, and that the would be the
means of hastening the hour of their redemption. 
(Applause.)</p>
        <p>F.  W. CHESSON, Esq., then moved the following resolution:—</p>
        <p>“That the best thanks of this meeting be presented 
to the Honourable Arthur Kinnaird, M.P. for his 
kindness in discharging the duties of treasurer; and to 
Harper Twelvetrees, Esq. for his presidency upon this 
occasion, and also for his valuable services as Chairman
<pb id="ander177" n="177"/>
of the Committee, and for the liberal pecuniary 
aid which he has, from time to time, rendered on behalf 
of John Anderson.”</p>
        <p>He (Mr. Chesson) was sure that the Committee, who 
were well aware of the liberality displayed by their 
Chairman, would agree with him (Mr. Chesson) that 
that gentleman was entitled to their best thanks. In 
the course of some further complimentary remarks, 
Mr. Chesson stated that he believed for some considerable 
time past, in consequence of the lowness of their 
funds, the maintenance of John Anderson had solely 
depended upon Mr. Twelvetrees.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Dr. HEWLE TT seconded the resolution in 
similar terms, and then submitted the resolution to the 
meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. HARPER TWELVETREES, in responding thanked
them heartily for their kind expressions towards him.
He had endeavoured to discharge what he felt to be his
duty, and was glad to have an opportunity of acknowledging 
the kindness and assistance he had received 
from the committee, and especially for the hearty
co-operation of his friends, the honorary secretaries. He
could assure that meeting that the committee, who had
been deeply interested in promoting Anderson's welfare,
had had many an anxious meeting together. (Hear, hear.)
Their path, at the commencement, appeared beset with
difficulties, but he was sure they now had occasion to
rejoice that HE who had guided them by his counsel,
had brought their labours to so gratifying a conclusion.
<pb id="ander178" n="178"/>
He rejoiced on behalf of John Anderson himself. He 
had a magnificent prospect before him, and if he only 
exerted himself, as they trusted he would do, he might 
certainly attain a position which, during his previous 
history, he could hardly have anticipated. (Cheers.) 
He (the Chairman) hoped that he would not omit to 
write to them, and he trusted to hear a good account of 
him in future. His best wishes were for his prosperity 
both in temporal and spiritual things. He sincerely hoped 
that John Anderson would find Liberia all that he desired, 
and that there he would be permitted to spend a long, 
prosperous, and useful life, devoted to the promotion of 
the best interests of man and the glory of God. (Cheers.)</p>
        <p>The following resolution was then proposed by W. 
Farmer, Esq., and seconded by F. W. Chesson, Esq:—</p>
        <p>“That the thanks of this meeting be presented to 
Cooke Baines, Esq., and Joseph A. Horner, Esq., the 
Honorary Secretaries to the committee of John Anderson, 
for their indefatigable exertions to further his 
interests since his arrival in this country.”</p>
        <p>The resolution on being put to the meeting, was 
carried unanimously, after which, the gentlemen above 
named, responded in appropriate language, and the 
proceedings terminated.</p>
        <p>On the following morning, December 23rd, John 
Anderson, in company with the Chairman and Honorary 
Secretaries of his committee, waited upon Gerard 
Ralston, Esq., Consul-General, to thank him for his 
letters of introduction to the President of the Republic of
<pb id="ander179" n="179"/>
Liberia, and other principal Officers Of State; and also 
for his kindness in procuring him a grant of land. The 
interview lasted a considerable time, and much practical 
and important advice was communicated to Anderson 
by Mr. Ralston, who, on leaving, made Anderson a 
present of a parcel of books. The remainder of the 
day was occupied in taking leave of London friends, 
and finally at five o'clock p.m., he was accompanied to 
Euston Station by Messrs. Baines and Horner, and left 
London for Liverpool in charge of Mr. Pool, by whom 
he was conducted, on the following morning, to the 
African Steam Ship <hi rend="italics">Armenia,</hi> leaving for Cape Palmas.</p>

          <l>HUSH! open wide your ears, I say,</l>
          <l>All you who boast of English blood; </l>
          <l>One of your race stands here to-day,</l>
          <l>A suitor;—shall he be withstood? </l>
          <l>One, freer than yourselves, is here</l>
          <l>To twit you with “his rights of man;” </l>
          <l>He wants his own, his claim is clear!</l>
          <l>Refuse him justice if you can. </l>
          <l>What asks he there across the wave? </l>
          <l>But this, that you'll give back his slave; </l>
          <l>He only asks that you'll rechain</l>
          <l>The freeman whom your rights made free, </l>
          <l>Who knew, 'mongst you, that he'd remain</l>
          <l>The man his God made him to be.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>No word of all your British stuff,</l>
          <l>Your air makes men even of the black. </l>
          <l>His owner claims this thing—enough,</l>
          <l>Give back his chattel, give it back; </l>
          <l>What if you know it has a soul</l>
          <l>To madden, and a back to lash, </l>
          <l>This Christian knows both black as coal,</l>
          <l>Both made for torturing; cease your trash! </l>
          <l>Hark to him there across the wave, </l>
          <l>“To hang—to burn—I'll have my slave; </l>
          <l>What are your talked-of rights to me;</l>

        <lg>
          <l>His hand's not black, his hand is red,</l>
          <l>Red with HIS blood, who, on his track,</l>
          <l>As from his hell of chains he fled,</l>
          <l>Stretched, to that hell, to seize him back.</l>
          <l>Murderer? he dared, like those who made</l>
          <l>Their Bunker's Hill their boast to-day,</l>
          <l>When freedom against life was weighed,</l>
          <l>The enslaver, as God bade, to slay.</l>
          <l>You who of Garibaldi rave,</l>
          <l>And howl at Bourbons, chain this slave!</l>
          <l>His right arm struck the self-same blows</l>
          <l>Italian bondsmen dealt of late;</l>
          <l>With them, he's one of slavery's foes;</l>
          <l>Give him to worse than Bomba's hate!</l>

          <l>O God! that we—we here to-day,</l>
          <l>This very hour in England, can</l>
          <l>Be asked to scan our laws and weigh</l>
          <l>This devil's right—this claim to man!</l>
          <l>Talk not of laws! who does not know</l>
          <l>No slave, a slave, can tread our soil!</l>
          <l>No, no, we have not fallen so low,</l>
          <l>This does not make our blood to boil;</l>
          <l>Of rights our nature scouts, he raves; </l>
          <l>Spit at the man! we chain his slaves?</l>
          <l>No, be our name the whole world's scorn,—</l>
          <l>Slave torturer's lashes seam each back,</l>
          <l>Man's, woman's, child's, amongst us born,</l>
          <l>If we to chains give this man back</l>
        </lg>
        <pb id="ander182" n="182"/>
        <lg>
          <l>And can a treaty bid us dare</l>
          <l>To act this sin to man and God! </l>
          <l>If so, the accursed writing tear,</l>
          <l>Beneath our feet its shreds be trod! </l>
          <l>No man-made laws, in this, shall bind</l>
          <l>Our Christian souls hell's work to do; </l>
          <l>The devil and his tools shall find,</l>
          <l>In this, to God alone we're true. </l>
          <l>Not in our judges' breath shall live </l>
          <l>The answer that to-day we give; </l>
          <l>For me, whatever come, I say,</l>
          <l>If laws command us, “Let him go!” </l>
          <l>God's will, not man's, I will obey;</l>
          <l>Give back his slave? we thunder “No.”</l>
