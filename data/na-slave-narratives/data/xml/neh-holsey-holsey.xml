        <head>PREFACE.</head>
        <p>This book is published with the hope of doing good in
more ways than will be expedient to state at this time.
It is intended not only to disseminate the truths and glory
of the gospel system, but also, as far as possible, to
inspire the Negro to think, and to encourage investigation,
literary advancement and authorship by men of my race.</p>
        <p>The sermons, essays, etc., are selected from what I have
been preaching and writing for the last decade. Originally,
the sermons were not designed for publication, but
for private use. The lectures and essays, with few
exceptions, were designed for the public, and most of them
have appeared in the public prints. I have written as I
have thought, always following what seemed to be the
truth, the conclusions of others, save the inspired Word,
to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
        <p>Rev. Prof. John W Gilbert; A.B., A.M., of The Paine
Institute, is the immediate cause of the appearance of the
book upon the arena of thought and action. Often he has
urged me to publish a book of sermons for the sake of
helping the church and race of which I am a representative.
He has gone so far as to become sponsor for its
publication. Also, he has, in collaboration with Rev. Geo.
Williams Walker, D.D., President of The Paine Institute,
read the manuscript and corrected the proof. Gladly do
I take this opportunity of thanking these two
distinguished scholars for the labor which they have so patiently
and willingly bestowed upon these pages. I am
incapable of expressing the high appreciation and esteem
which their labor upon this book begets. Their labor, of
course, was confined to the mechanical make-up of the
<pb id="hols4" n="4"/>
book. For its doctrines and sentiments I am solely and
independently responsible.</p>
        <p>Twenty per cent. of the net proceeds of the sale of this
volume I shall give to The Paine Institute.</p>
        <p>If by this book the kingdom of Christ and the uplift of
mankind are promoted even in the slightest degree, my
prayers will have been abundantly answered.</p>

        <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
        <p>I take real pleasure in introducing this volume of 
sermons to the public. Not that a volume of sermons is a
rarity, but the present one occupies in several respects a
unique position, in that it represents the production of an
ex-slave, who without the aid of school, and, despite
untoward circumstances, exemplifies what aspirations
the missionaries to the slave awakened and that civil law
could not put down. This pleasure is enhanced by an
acquaintance with its author for fourteen years that has
endeared him to my heart as an honored friend.</p>
        <p>Bishop Lucius H. Holsey was a member of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, South. He represents a faithful 
product of the missionary zeal of this church that was 
awakened by Bishop Capers in founding the missions to 
the slaves. His fidelity to trust and zeal for the salvation 
of souls caused him to be appointed a local preacher 
before emancipation. So that when the changed conditions 
that followed in the wake of the civil war came upon the 
church he was an active exponent of that conservative 
force that resulted in the organization of the Colored 
Methodist Episcopal Church in America. Not only is the 
Bishop one of the organizers of his church, but he has ever
been promotive of its highest and best interests, and the 
source by far of its public documents. He has supervised 
the editorial work of all his church's literature, compiling 
its hymn book, discipline, manual of the discipline, etc. 
He discerns in slavery a providential blessing to both 
white and black—a harsh measure to bring the ignorant 
Negro in contact with the educated <sic corr="Caucasian.">Caucassian.</sic> He as 
firmly regards emancipation as the very best measure for
<pb id="hols6" n="6"/>
the development of the highest interest alike for the 
white man and the black. His views are to be seen in his 
autobiography and in his recent address delivered before 
many of our annual conferences.</p>
        <p>Deprived of the advantages of the school room, he has 
been a close student of men and nature. He gives us a 
partial insight to the manful effort he put forth to 
educate himself as best he could. We see in his autobiography 
what books he read. What influence these books 
had upon him is seen in many of his sermons. He was in 
a situation to appreciate the great need of school training. 
He has for years represented the foremost demands 
and zeal of educational endeavor in the interest of his
own church. He presented the first plans for a school 
for the youth of his church which developed into The 
Paine Institute. He was the first colored man to give 
money to the erection of such a school. While Rev. W. 
C. Dunlap, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, was 
Commissioner of Education, just before Rev. W. M. Hayes, 
of the same church became commissioner, Bishop Holsey, 
by advice of Bishop E. R. Hendrix, of the Methodist 
Episcopal Church, South, went before the Missouri Conference 
of the same church, and presenting the claims of The 
Paine Institute, collected between three and four
hundred dollars for a much needed building. Thus providentially
thrust out he kept on before the conferences of this 
church until he had collected about $3,000 from only a 
few of the conferences. As it was largely through his 
influence that the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, 
was aroused to the demand of the Colored Methodist 
Episcopal Church for Christian education of her children, 
so it was eminently fit for the burden of awakening a 
deeper enthusiasm in the educational work to devolve 
upon him.</p>
        <p>Therefore, at the urgent solicitation of the Board of
Education of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, 
backed by appointment and request of the Board of Trustees
<pb id="hols7" n="7"/>
of The Paine Institute, the Bishop went before this 
church with an appeal for $25,000 to erect a building at 
this school to be known as the Haygood Memorial Hall. 
He is not in any wise a commissioner of education, but 
at the urgent solicitation of his brethren is actively asking 
money for the erection of this hall. As if this were 
not enough he contributes a handsome per cent. of the 
sale of this volume to the erection of the Haygood 
Memorial Hall.</p>
        <p>Bishop Holsey is the best known Bishop of the Colored
Methodist Episcopal Church. He has represented his 
church on several occasions, both by pen and person. In 
the New York Independent his church has been presented 
to the public by articles from his pen. At the Ecumenical 
Conference in London, he represented his church as 
her chosen delegate. His appeal to the General Conference 
of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, in behalf 
of a school for the youth of his church resulted in the 
establishment and maintenance of The Paine Institute, at
Augusta, Georgia.</p>
        <p>Bishop Holsey is an eloquent preacher whose mind has 
a decidedly philosophical trend. He has appeared before 
many large gatherings of the people, sometimes made up 
wholly of white persons, as preacher, lecturer, orator. In 
each sphere he has acquitted himself well and brought 
about most beneficial results. He is the Munsey of the 
Colored Methodist Episcopal Church.</p>
        <p>Without further delay I present this book to the public.
Whatever is found in it that is helpful and praiseworthy 
attribute to the heart and mind of its author; whatever 
of shortcoming or imperfection, attribute to the lack of 
education, training and culturing development.</p>

        <head>AUTOBIOGRAPHY
<lb/>
OF
<lb/>
BISHOP L. H. HOLSEY.</head>
        <p>I was born in Georgia, near Columbus, in 1842, and at
that time was the slave of James Holsey, who was also
my father. He was a gentleman of classical education,
dignified in appearance and manner of life, and 
represented that old antebellum class of Southern aristocracy
who did not know enough of manual labor to black their
own shoes or saddle their own horse. Like many others
of his day and time he never married, but mingled, to
some extent, with those females of the African race that
were his slaves—his personal property. My mother was
named Louisa, and was of pure African descent. She
was of fascinating appearance and comely parts. Her
father was named “Alex,” and was an African of the
Africans. He was short, thickset, and of a stubborn
and massive build. He lived to be nearly a hundred
years of age. So far as I know, all his children were
daughters, of whom my mother was the youngest. She
was an intensely religious woman, a most exemplary
Christian, and belonged to the M. E. Church, South.
She had fourteen children, myself being the oldest. I
lived with her until about six years of age, when my
father died, and I became the property of Mr. T. L.
Wynn, who lived in Sparta, Ga. Mr. Wynn was my
second owner. I served him as body servant until 1857,
when he died. A few days before his death he called
me to his bed and told me that he was going to die, and
<pb id="hols10" n="10"/>
wanted me to choose one of two of his intimate friends
as my master. He named the two friends and I chose Col.
R. M. Johnston, with whom I lived until the emancipation 
of the slaves. As he was a very kind man to his
slaves, I remained on the plantation with him one year
after the emancipation. From the fall of 1857 until the
emancipation I was his house servant, and looked after
his domestic interests in general. He had great 
confidence in me and trusted me with money and other 
valuables. In all things I was honest and true to him and
his interests. Though young, I felt as much interest in
his well-being as I have felt since in my own. I made
it a special point never to lie to him or deceive him in
any way. I felt that I could not afford to be false even
to those who appeared to be my enslavers and oppressors, 
and I have never regretted this course in after years.
The training that I received in the narrow house of
slavery has been a minister of correction and mercy to
me in all these years of struggle, trial, labor, and anxiety.
I have no complaint against American slavery. It
was a blessing in disguise to me and to many. It has
made the negro race what it could not have been in its
native land. Slavery was but a circumstance or a link
in the transitions of humanity, and must have its greatest 
bearing upon the future.</p>
        <p>Col. Johnston, my last owner, had an interesting family
of seven brilliant children and a brilliant wife. For 
them I have the best wishes and the highest esteem.</p>
        <p>In 1867-68 I cultivated a cotton farm in Hancock 
county, Ga., on rented land. My wife and I labored to 
make an honest living. Assisted by two young men 
whom I hired, I made a competent living. My house was 
built of skinned pine poles and contained two large 
rooms and a hall. It was so constructed that every part 
of the spacious building had windows, so that I was out 
of doors while I was in doors. In my humble palace on 
a hill in the woods beneath the shade of towering pines
<pb id="hols11" n="11"/>
and sturdy oaks, I felt as a king whose supreme 
commands were “law and gospel” to my subjects. Here I
dwelt for two years cultivating the cotton farm and 
preaching at the same time. This was in the years of 
1868-'69. Prior to this in 1866 I farmed on the old 
plantation of Col. Johnston. My wife then “took in washing” 
and I ran “a one-horse farm.” Col. Johnston, the owner 
of the place, conducted a large boarding school, and my 
wife was laundress for the students. By this combination 
of interests we made a “handsome living,” and all
was well.</p>
        <p>From my youth I felt a call to preach the gospel, 
although I saw no opening for such a thing in the days of 
slavery; but still there was a hope and a lingering anticipation 
that somehow, in the divine arrangements, I 
would ultimately have an opportunity to proclaim God's 
truth. In the little church that stands beneath the oaks 
and cedars, in the village of Sparta, Ga., I was licensed 
to preach. It was in February, 1868, under the pastorate 
of Rev. A. J. Garrell, that I appeared before the 
Quarterly Conference. Rev. W. H. Potter, D.D., was the 
Presiding Elder. Bishop George F. Pierce being present, 
I had to be examined by him. He was a wonderful 
preacher, with wide influence, and august presence. 
Everybody loved, respected, and some almost adored 
him. Coming before such a high personage I was scared 
out of my wits, and all that I had previously known 
seemed to have taken the wings of the winds and fled 
away. But I was examined pretty closely, especially on 
the doctrines of the church, and the Bible, yet, somehow, 
I came out all right. In 1862 I was married to Miss Harriett 
A. Turner, a girl then fifteen years of age, who 
had been reared by Bishop Pierce, and given by him to 
his son-in-law, Mr. Turner, as a maid for his wife. We 
were married in the spacious hall of the Bishop's 
residence by him on the 8th day of November, 1862. The 
Bishop's wife and daughters had provided for the occasion
<pb id="hols12" n="12"/>
a splendid repast of good things to eat. The table, 
richly spread, with turkey, ham, cake, and many other 
things, extended nearly the whole length of the spacious 
dining hall. “The house girls” and “the house boys” 
and the most prominent persons of color were invited to 
the wedding of the colored “swells.” The ladies 
composing the Bishop's family, dressed my bride in the 
gayest and most artistic style, with red flowers and scarlet 
sashes predominating in the brilliant trail. As the 
gorgeous flashes of waving scarlet and white softly moved 
across the spacious hall and stood in the glare of the 
light, I thought I saw in my Harriett an angel in the 
dwarfed splendors of heaven as if ornamented with gems 
set upon a background of gold. In the vision of life that 
then threw its brightness upon me, I saw nothing but 
the roseate splendors of its triumphs and its glory. But 
since then I have seen something of its opposite phases, 
and know much of its trials, reverses and disappointments. 
From the union thus formed fourteen children 
were born, but only nine of them lived. One of them, 
the first child, a daughter, died in her seventeenth year. 
The others died at birth. I have at present, eight living 
children, four of whom are boys.</p>
        <p>After I was licensed to preach in 1868, I belonged to 
the M. E. Church, South, as all colored people did who 
were Methodists in the slave States. In 1868 and 1869, 
I was on the Hancock circuit which covered the entire 
county. Rev. E. B. Oliver and myself were the pastors. 
I was senior and he junior. There were seven churches 
on the circuit, and we followed each other in rotation. 
Brother Oliver was a great preacher, also great in prayer 
and song. He was the popular man among the people 
and their ideal man and pastor. He had a clear, loud, 
high, ringing voice, with a rare depth of pathos and 
sweetness. He could make his voice thunder, thud, or 
scream, as the occasion required, and a few blasts, as it 
were, of his silver clarion, in that “age of stone” was
<pb id="hols13" n="13"/>
considered a wonderful sermon. One of the most 
difficult things with which I had to contend, was to get from 
under the withering blight of his trumpet voice. The 
man that had the loudest voice and the most dramatic 
emotions in pulpit or on platform, was necessarily, irrevocably, 
infallibly, and eternally in the estimation of the 
people, the great preacher, the flying angel of the 
everlasting gospel. But as I was farming, and not depending
on the people for a living, I continued common sense 
preaching, which was considered by the undiscerning 
multitudes as very dry. My hearers would often take a 
nap while I was trying to do my little talking. My voice 
was very poor, weak, and defective, which greatly 
militated against me as a preacher. As a preacher's ability, 
in those days, was measured by his voice, a poor fellow
like I was in a bad fix. It was noise that moved the 
multitudes, held the public ear, and like magic, swayed 
the public heart. For a long time I did not know where 
the trouble lay. I could not move the multitudes to 
tears like the junior preacher, although it was understood 
by the people that I was “the deeper reasoner,” as 
they used to say, but was “no preacher.” However, I 
never was discouraged by the adverse verdict of the people, 
because I had higher aims, ambition, and an unflagging 
industry which never faltered, but pressed every 
moment and opportunity into service that could be 
spared from the farm and circuit work. But it was
voice that I needed more than learning or gospel. What 
shall I do to make it thunder, scream, screech, howl, or 
roar as did the junior preacher. I had heard of a great 
Grecian orator, who, to improve his voice, put pebbles 
of stone in his mouth, and spoke against the loud roar 
of waves on the sea shore. As I lived in the hill country 
away from the great waters and as “there was no more
sea” for me, I often spent an hour in the woods, and from 
a pine stump, serving as a temporary pulpit, I would 
take the text to be used on the next Sabbath, and from
<pb id="hols14" n="14"/>
it preach in a loud voice. I went through with all the 
gestures and attitudes with some respect for silent 
nature as was to be given to the listening congregation.
A stump was my pulpit, the trees, grape-vines, and the 
smaller daughters of the woods were my congregation, 
and the open heavens were the high dome under which 
I proclaimed the truth as best I could to a silent and
emotionless multitude. This practice helped me wonderfully,
and soon I began to thunder and rattle like the 
other big preachers.</p>
        <p>No salary was fixed for the circuit preachers. Each
man made his living in the sweat of his face, and
preached on Sunday as best he could. But at the end
of the second year it was proposed by some of the 
members of one of the churches to give the preachers a 
collection, and they willingly and generously gave us both
the magnanimous sum of four dollars for the two years'
services. We both were present, and a wide-awake and
generous brother paid us the money, and with a triumphant 
air on his beaming countenance, said to us, in the
tone of self-congratulation, “We are glad you don't
preach for money, but for souls.” Thus ended my first
two years as circuit preacher. The memory of those
two years is still fresh and green with its romance and
“spiritual revelries.” The following year (January 4th,
1869) Bishop Pierce called all the preachers of color, 
belonging to the M. E. Church, South, in the State of Georgia 
to meet in Trinity church at Augusta. On the day
appointed, about sixty of the preachers assembled in
Conference, and here, under the presidency of Bishop
Geo. F. Pierce, the first Annual Conference was organized. 
Up to this time, all the colored preachers were
merely <hi rend="italics">local,</hi> and but few had received ordination. The
material was very raw and untrained, and the men 
presented that uncouth appearance that belonged to the
earlier days of freedom. A few had on long coats, and
“plug” or “stove-pipe” hats, and all who could, wore
<pb id="hols15" n="15"/>
long hair so as to look venerable, which was thought to 
be very becoming to ministerial dignity. To be in style 
and maintain the exalted dignity of the venerable parsons, 
I was adorned with a bushy head of red hair, parted 
in the middle, and covered by a “stove-pipe hat” of 
indefinite length. Like many other young circuit riders, 
fresh from the “bushes,” I began to suspect that I was a 
very wonderful personality, based especially upon the
length of my hat, and the enormous amount of “the 
insufferable wool” upon which it was pillared. I made 
the same mistakes that I have often observed in young 
preachers in later years. I was too big a fool to 
know that I was a fool. But the wear and tear 
of years will correct such errors, and force our erratic 
manhood into line. Of this conference of “raw 
recruits” I became a member. As there had to be a 
starting point, all the preachers who attended became 
at once full members of the Conference, and deacon's 
orders were given to most of them. At this Conference 
I was ordained a deacon by Bishop Pierce and sent to 
Savannah, Ga. After I had received the appointment I 
returned home, sold out my farming interests, abandoned 
the plow, gathered my family, and went to Savannah to 
take charge of the colored church known as “Andrew 
Chapel.” But this church was seized upon by the A. M. 
E. Connection, and was then in litigation. As there was 
no way for me to get or use the church, the white people 
of Trinity church in Savannah gave me their library to 
preach in, which was located up stairs in the rear of the
church. Lest we should come in conflict with the white
congregation because of our noise, we held our meetings 
only in the afternoons on the Sabbath. Here I preached
and labored as pastor with a membership of about fifteen 
for six months. As the church was in litigation and 
could not be obtained until the decision of the court, I 
returned to my home near Sparta, Ga. Up to this time 
I was very deficient in that training that was almost
<pb id="hols16" n="16"/>
absolutely essential for successful work in the ministry. 
I had a wife and three children to care for, and a very 
little of this world's goods. It is true, it required but 
little for their support, but then that little was essential. 
Happily for us, we lived two miles in the country from 
the town, where we had no rent to pay, no wood to buy, 
and were surrounded by plenty of vegetables and fruits. 
My wife milked a cow that was given to us by the owner 
of the place. We had chickens and eggs besides. I had
learned to read to some extent in the days of slavery, 
and I thought that I knew it all, but going to Savannah 
was an “eye-opener,” and I now had begun to see myself 
in the true light. Savannah was too big for me, and I 
was too little for Savannah. I learned by the dint of 
adverse conditions that the world had more in it than I 
had hitherto calculated.</p>
        <p>As stated before, in 1857, when my second owner, Mr. 
T. L. Wynn, died, I became the property of Col. R. M. 
Johnston. In the early winter of that year he went to 
Athens, Ga., and became a professor in the State College. 
As an important part of his effects, I was carried along 
with him and his family as carriage driver, house 
servant, and gardener. I was then fifteen years of age. 
As soon as I arrived in Athens, I felt an insatiable craving
for some knowledge of books, and especially I was 
anxious to learn to read the Bible. What must I do? I 
was a slave and could not attend school, and it was 
considered unwise, if not dangerous for slaves to read and 
write. But my owners, although strict, were very kind, 
especially my master. So I determined to learn to read 
at all hazards, and take whatever risks there might be 
connected with it. There was a junk house in the city 
where rags were sold. I gathered and saved all the rags 
that I could, and sold them that I might get some money 
with which to buy books. After weeks of toil and 
intense vigilance in gathering and watching for rags that 
belonged to the first man that laid hands upon them, I
<pb id="hols17" n="17"/>
had accumulated about thirty pounds. These I stuffed 
into the legs and seat of a pair of old white pantaloons, 
the cast-off garment of a large and long-legged man. At 
nights after tea, I was allowed to “go down town” for 
recreation. I hired a boy to help me carry the rags to 
sell them to the rag merchant. The boy put one leg of 
the pants on one shoulder, and the other leg on the other, 
and we both marched to town with bright dreams of 
wealth. Reaching the store, I lingered in the darkness 
in front of the door, and when the boy walked in with 
something that had the appearance of a fat man on his 
shoulders, the man said in a loud voice as if astonished 
at the strange sight, “What in the h— is that you have 
on your back?” “Some rags,” replied the boy. “Well, 
lay them on the scales,” said the merchant. So we did, 
the rags were sold and the money was mine. With this 
money I bought books. I purchased at one time, two 
“Webster blue back spellers,” a common school dictionary, 
Milton's “Paradise Lost,” and a Bible. These then
constituted my full stock of literary possessions, a library 
more precious than gold to me. There were several 
colored people in town that could “spell to baker,” in the 
old speller, while others could go to “the a, b, ab's” or 
to “the b, a, ba's.” The white children and an old 
colored man taught me the alphabet, after which I 
fought my way unaided through the depths of my
ponderous library. Day by day I took a leaf from one of 
the spelling books, and so folded it that one or two of 
the lessons were on the outside as if printed on a card. 
This I put in the pocket of my vest or coat, and when I 
was sitting on the carriage, walking the yard or streets, 
or using hoe or spade, or in the dining room, I would take 
out my spelling leaf, catch a word and commit it to 
memory. When one side of the spelling leaf was 
finished by this process, I would refold it again with a new
lesson on the outside. When night came, I went to my 
little room, and with chips of fat pine, and pine roots 
<pb id="hols18" n="18"/>
that were grubbed up from the woods near by, I would 
kindle a little blaze in the fire-place and turn my head 
toward it while lying flat on my back so as to get the 
most of the light on the leaves of the book. Thus lying 
on the floor with pine knots at hand and my blankets 
around me, I reviewed the lessons of the day from the 
unmaimed book. By these means I learned to read and 
write a little in six months. Besides, I would catch 
words from the white people and retain them in memory 
until I could get to my dictionary. Then I would spell 
and define the words, until they became perfectly 
impressed upon my memory.</p>
        <p>In 1858, in Athens, Ga., I was converted, and became
a member of the Methodist church. At that time Rev. 
W. A. Parks was sent as pastor to the colored church, 
while his uncle, Rev. H. H. Parks, was pastor of the 
white people's church. During April and May of this 
year, Rev. H. M. Turner, (now Bishop) came to Athens 
and preached every night to appreciative congregations, 
and under his powerful sermons I experienced a change 
of heart, and became a zealous member of the church. 
I was taken into the church by Rev. Mr. Parks, and 
baptized and fellowshipped by his uncle, the Rev. H. H. 
Parks.</p>
        <p>In 1861 when the war began, my owners moved back 
to Hancock county where I remained until freedom came 
to the slaves. After returning from Savannah in 1869, 
I began afresh my studies. That I might be retired and 
placed in the best condition to prosecute my studies, I 
purchased a number of school books and theological 
works, and sought a convenient place in the woods nearby 
where I was then living. Every day when the
weather would permit I resorted to this place for study,
contemplation, and prayer. By the bank of a little 
rippling brook that came murmuring down the rocky 
hillsides, I found an over-hanging boulder that ran up 
perpendicularly, mildly facing the east. A cluster of maple
<pb id="hols19" n="19"/>
trees, interspersed with sweet gum, that constantly 
dropped their fragrance along the brook beneath, I 
selected as a silent boudoir. Wild grape-vines interlaced 
with yellow jessamines, wrapt around the slim trunks 
of the towering wood, and threw a crown of green and 
tangled meshes of vines and flowers on the waving limbs 
above. The murmuring brook that rolled below 
whispered to me the presence of God, the wonders of his 
providence, and the marvels of his hand. Here, in the deep 
solitudes of silent nature, retired and alone, I spent the 
greater part of two years. Here I studied reading, writing,
geography, grammar, arithmetic, astronomy, history, 
and theology. I read Milton, Dick's Works, Watson, 
Wesley, Stevens' History of Methodism, and a number 
of other books. Among them were “Barnes' Notes,” and 
“Newton on the Prophecies.” I gave close attention to 
the English language, as I would need that more than 
anything else. When I came to a word that I did not
understand I would turn to the dictionary, spell it and 
define it, and with a cedar pencil I would write down 
every word thus acquired. On the next day I first had 
a thorough review of all the words and all that I had 
read and studied the day before. I cared nothing for 
gold and silver, nor the presence and company of 
mankind, nor anything that would divert the mind from its 
deep thoughts of God or intense application. At the 
end of about twenty months I was lost and bewildered 
in the deep things of God. However, I rose from my 
hermit home with spiritual powers and convictions that 
have been a wonderful help to me through all these years 
of struggle and toil. I became so intensely interested 
and profoundly engaged that sometimes I seemed to have 
been out of the body and in another sphere where God 
and angels stood nearer to men. There are no months 
and days in my life more precious to me than those days 
of mental struggle and silent contemplation. Then it 
was that my intellect was broadened and deepened, my 
religious proclivities intensified, and my character fixed.</p>
        <pb id="hols20" n="20"/>
        <p>In the fall of 1869 the colored conference of Georgia 
met in Macon, having Bishop Pierce for its President. 
Here I was ordained Elder and elected delegate to the 
organizing General Conference, which met in Jackson,
Tenn., the 15th day of December, when the Colored 
Methodist Episcopal Church in America became a 
separate organization. I was present as a delegate during 
the session of the conference and voted upon all the 
measures that were put forth for the organization of the 
C. M. E. Church into a separate body. I was also the 
strongest advocate for the election of W. H. Miles, of
Kentucky, to the bishopric. I first entered his name as 
a suitable person for the bishopric, and on the first 
ballot he was triumphantly elected.</p>
        <p>In January, 1871, the Conference convened in Augusta,
Ga. Three Bishops were present, Miles, Vanderhost 
and Pierce. Bishops Miles and Vanderhost were the 
presidents, and presided on alternate days. Bishop 
Pierce was the distinguished and honored guest. When 
the appointments were read out I was appointed to 
Trinity church, then the leading church in the conference, 
and perhaps in the connection. Here I was pastor two 
years and four months. In the fall of 1872 the conference
was held in Columbus, Ga. Bishop Miles presided, 
and I was elected delegate to the called session of the 
General Conference which met in Augusta, Ga., in March, 
1873. I received every vote in the Annual Conference 
cast for delegates to the called session of the General 
Conference. When the General Conference assembled 
in extraordinary session in Augusta, in 1873, I was then
pastor of Trinity church in which the conference was 
held. The business for which the General Conference 
was convoked in extraordinary session, was the election 
and consecration of three Bishops. Bishop Vanderhost 
was dead, and the whole presiding fell upon Bishop
Miles. Bishop Pierce was present by special invitation.
<pb id="hols21" n="21"/>
Three men were elected Bishops, namely: J. A. Beebe, 
L. H. Holsey, and Isaac Lane. I was elected on the first 
ballot with Bishop Beebe, and I think I received every 
vote cast but two. I assisted Bishop Miles in preparing 
the Bishop's message for the conference, and took a leading 
part in all its work. Bishop Pierce preached the 
ordination sermon on the Sabbath, and at that time I was 
ordained Bishop by Bishop Miles, assisted by Bishop 
Pierce. Here also, Bishops Beebe and Lane were 
ordained. The respective fields of labor for the new Bishops 
were laid off, and I was sent to Texas, Arkansas, 
Alabama, and Tennessee. The Bishop's salary was fixed at 
eight hundred dollars, his traveling expenses to be paid 
by the work he served. The work was poorly organized, 
and, indeed, was scarcely organized at all. I had with
myself, seven in family. It was hard to get bread to 
live on and pay traveling expenses. My wife and children 
lived mainly on peas, bacon, and corn bread, having 
biscuits for Sunday morning breakfast. None of them 
had any shoes but went barefooted, and nearly naked, 
and lived in only a two-room house in Augusta. The
first ten years was a struggle, a terrible struggle to keep 
our heads above the wave. I have been so pushed for 
fuel on a cold night that I would take the coal ashes and 
wash them in water and drain out the burnt bits of coal 
in order to make a fire. In these years of suffering and 
almost starvation, my vegetable garden was the main 
and real dependence for a living. My good wife being
strong and muscular stood by our garden, and often at 
night when the moon was shining, she and I would put 
the little ones to bed, and work until twelve o'clock. 
She would often cut short the rations for the family that 
I might have money to reach the appointments and build 
up the connection. No one knows the anxiety, the sorrow, 
and the depth of suffering through which I have 
had to pass for the church of my choice. The annals of 
God alone can tell. I cannot. But on I went, struggling
<pb id="hols22" n="22"/>
up the hill of difficulty, often staggering and trembling 
beneath the heavy load. At an earlier period of my 
history (1869-70) my small amount of money once gave out 
and I taught a little school that kept the wolf of hunger 
from the door. This process of training to which I 
subjected myself, in its results, is, of course, infinitely better 
than ignorance; but it is far inferior to a regular course 
in the schools. I have found that it is patchwork, a kind 
of crazy quilt education; and yet this form of training 
has its blessings and advantages. It teaches a man 
to rely upon his own efforts, and by experience he is 
convinced that nothing is impossible for him to accomplish 
by industry and faithful application. Since I have been 
a Bishop I have been in the regular work. I have tried 
to do the work assigned to my hands with an eye single 
to the glory of God, the good of the race, and the salvation 
of men. I have traveled and preached all over the
Southern States many times, and have been intensely 
interested in the establishment of the Colored Methodist 
Episcopal Church in America. Not because I thought 
it to be the best church in itself, not because I thought 
it purer and better than other such organizations, but 
because I thought it to be the most fitted religious power 
to meet the peculiar conditions that exist in the Southern 
States. Harmony between the two races is what is 
needed. There can be no great progress in the betterment 
of the people of color without peace and harmony. 
The pulpit has much to do with human sentiment, and 
consequently with the actions of men. A semi-civilized 
people are necessarily greatly controlled by their 
religious feelings and sentiments. Often they are very 
religious, and at the same time very slow to comprehend 
their true status and the best modes of procedure in the 
chief things that make for their peace and prosperity. 
Many conditions and facts come in to make the Negro 
race unique in this country. The diversity of manhood 
brought about by the diversity of character presents to
<pb id="hols23" n="23"/>
the calm judgment of the philanthropist intricate 
questions that involve the life and safety of the race. Moral 
purity and Christian excellence being equal, the best 
church for them is that religious organization that can, 
without compromising its great fundamental principles, 
adapt itself to present conditions. From the time of the 
emancipation of the slaves by the fortunes of war, I 
have not seen any reason why the Southern people should
not be the real and true friends of the Negro race. The 
very religion that they taught, and practiced, and 
preached to the Negroes, directed them to be the friends 
of the ex-slaves. Consequently, I can see no reasons 
why they should not teach Negroes in the school room. 
I saw from the first no reasons for any feelings of hate 
and revenge, either on them part of the one or the other. 
Accordingly, at the Conference held in Macon in 1869, I
wrote and offered a paper on Education, in which I 
advocated the establishment of a church school by the M. 
E. Church, South, for the training of Negro preachers, 
said school to be taught by some of the good white people 
of that church. I knew that colored ministers of the 
gospel were far behind in those accomplishments that 
best fitted them for that important work, and that up to 
that date there had been but few opportunities presented 
to them for improvement. It was also clear to my mind
that the white ministry was the only standard of 
excellence by which the colored ministers could be inspired 
to reach a higher plane of fitness. True, the Bible lay 
open before them, but in the conduct of the white ministers, 
the teachings of the Bible were displayed in visible, 
tangible form, and in its best practical phases. I 
thought then, and still think, the nearer the colored and
white preachers are to each other in the work of the 
ministry, the better it would be for us all. This view of 
things caused me to be a perpetual and persistent advocate 
of the establishment of a school for the training of 
our preachers under the care and complete control of
<pb id="hols24" n="24"/>
the M. E. Church, South, with teachers from the same 
source. “The Paine Institute” is the outcome of this 
sentiment. To enforce this idea I wrote a series of letters 
upon the subject in 1870 just prior to the organization 
of the Colored M. E. Church in America. The letters 
were published in the Christian Index while Dr. Watson 
was editing and publishing that paper for the colored 
people. At that time, and for some years after, many
people, white and colored, thought that I was a “crank,” 
and that it was the one thing impractical if not impossible.</p>
        <p>In 1882 I was sent as Fraternal Messenger to the 
General Conference of the M. E. Church, South, which 
assembled in Nashville, Tenn. I was especially instructed, 
first, to bear to them the friendly greetings of the colored 
church, and then to ask them to establish a school for us 
wherein our ministry might be properly trained and fitted 
for evangelistic work among their own people. 
When the General Conference of that church was held 
in Atlanta four years before, I addressed a rather lengthy
communication to them upon the same subject. Some 
things I then said were thought to be a little reproachful, 
or reflective on them. Their noble endeavors to 
preach the gospel in heathen countries, while they 
neglected the heathen at home, appeared to me to be 
inconsistent with the teachings of Christ and the Apostles. 
I meant not that the evangelical work in foreign
countries should be neglected, or left to perish, but that the 
needy people at home should have some attention given 
to them as was done in the days of slavery. It was true, 
there were many barriers in the way, but no more in this 
country than in foreign lands. It ought to be said, 
however, that after emancipation the Negroes held 
themselves aloof from the Southern people to such extent that 
no proposition made by the latter could reach the former.
Consequently, the margin for evangelistic labors among 
Negroes by Southern white people was narrow. When
<pb id="hols25" n="25"/>
The Paine Institute became a reality, but few of the 
colored people approved of it, and the men of my own 
“faith and order” were more against it than those on the 
outside. My own preachers fought it bitterly as an 
untimely and unwise measure. They fought it because 
they thought that other Negro organizations would 
reproach us for being under the Southern sentiment and 
bowing to the verdict of pure prejudice upon the race 
question. Already all the colored churches had branded 
us as “Democrats,” “bootlicks,” and “white folks' 
niggers,” whose only aim was ultimately to remand the 
freedmen back to abject bondage. This was, as 
subsequent events have proven, a distorted view of a great 
movement. But prior to the organization of the school 
in 1883, I traveled over the States, agitated the question, 
and spoke in its behalf in public and private. In the
early fall of 1882 I held the Virginia Conference in Front
Royal, and there I made a speech on the question, and 
laid the first dollar on the table that was ever given to 
it. Rev. W. T. Thomas followed with a like amount.</p>
        <p>When I made my speech before the General Conference 
of the M. E. Church, South, in Nashville, in 1882, in 
behalf of the school, it was well taken and highly 
appreciated by the large and intelligent audience. The 
venerable John B. McFerrin put his arms around my shoulders 
and congratulated me for its timeliness. So did a 
large number of others. While I knew that all was 
agreeable and pleasant, yet I had a sense of fear and a
thrill of doubt, lest I should make a failure, and the chief 
end for which I came should be defeated, and the whole 
project lost. But the golden eagle of success perched 
upon my staff, and I felt as a plumed knight beneath its 
wings. I had but one object in view and that was to 
help my fellowman. As this General Conference authorized 
the establishment of the school, and appointed a
committee to put the thing in motion, Bishop Pierce
being the chairman, called that committee to meet in 
<pb id="hols26" n="26"/>
Atlanta. In the summer of 1882 it convened in the First 
Church. Bishop Pierce and Dr. Haygood, and all the 
Bishops of the colored church were present. I wrote to 
our Bishops and urged them to be present, and all agreed 
to come but Bishop Miles. But I wrote him again to be 
present, lest he should hinder the initiatory of a great 
work, and to my surprise he came. The whole matter 
was discussed <hi rend="italics">pro</hi> and <hi rend="italics">con.</hi> It was agreed to locate
the school at Augusta, Ga., and ask the church for two 
hundred thousand dollars for facilities and endowment. 
Early in January, 1883, Rev. Morgan Calloway, D.D., 
then the vice-president of Emory College, and Rev. Geo. 
W. Walker, of the South Carolina Conference of the M. 
E. Church, South, came to Augusta and organized the 
school. For this purpose rooms were rented in the heart 
of the city, and I gathered up the students by personal
solicitation and public appeals until the number reached 
about thirty. Still it was a dark day for the school. 
Popular sentiment, among white and black, was 
widespread and bitter against it. But my friends were 
numerous, and Dr. Calloway used to say that I had more 
friends than any man he ever saw. I paid the first
hundred dollars that were ever given for that purpose, a few 
days before the organization of the school, and since that 
time I have given myself, and collected from others 
almost continuously whatever I could for it.</p>
        <p>In 1886, at the request of Rev. W. C. Dunlap, who was 
then its commissioner, I wrote a strong paper upon The 
Paine Institute, and sent it to him, and he sent it to the 
Nashville “Christian Advocate” to be published. But 
as it was so long before it appeared in the “Advocate,” I 
concluded that it had found its way to the waste basket. 
Finally it appeared and I afterward learned from Mr. 
Dunlap the reason for this delay. He told me that the
editor hesitated in publishing it because he believed it 
to be somebody else's production, and, consequently, 
“bogus.” It was thought that the paper was an abler
<pb id="hols27" n="27"/>
one than I could produce. It was published on the first 
page of the great church paper, a place where only the 
best documents appear.</p>
        <p>In 1890 I was impressed that enlarged facilities were 
almost essential to the successful work of the school, and 
I started out of my own accord, with almost infinite 
misgivings, to make speeches before as many Conferences 
of the M. E. Church, South, as I might be permitted to 
reach. This I did with good results, as to the aid given 
the school. Although I was self-appointed, these 
conferences gave me the warmest reception and responded 
<sic corr="liberally">librally</sic> to the cause. This conference year (1897-'98) I 
am out on the same work. The trustees of the school and 
the Bishops of the Colored Church, and others, thought 
it wise, and so steadily urged me to take the field again 
in behalf of the school. This I have done, and have 
spoken before fourteen of the Conferences. In 1886 the 
General Conference of the Colored Methodist Episcopal 
Church in America, met in Augusta, Ga., and at that 
session I wrote our “Financial Plan” by which Paine
Institute and the other schools have received a considerable
amount of money for their running expenses. I wrote this
financial plan with special reference to the support of 
the schools of the church, which at that time were only 
two—“The Paine” and “The Lane.” Perhaps there is no 
single act of legislation connected with the history of 
the church so significant and far-reaching in its effects 
as our “Financial Plan.” Prior to its adoption in 1886 
there was no way of a practical nature for the collection 
and disbursement of the general funds or general revenue 
of the church; but since the “Financial Plan” has 
been operated, the whole connection and the schools have
felt the advantages, and owe their life, in a large measure, 
to its operation.</p>
        <p>For twenty years I was the Secretary of the College of
Bishops, and kept the minutes of our meetings from year 
to year at my own expense. Also, for the same length
<pb id="hols28" n="28"/>
of time, I was the statistician and corresponding secretary 
of the connection, and replied to all communications 
of a public nature. I have written every Message 
for the Bishops except the one written by Bishop Miles, 
in 1873, and I assisted him in that one. Only two of 
these Messages have ever been changed in a single word 
or sentence by the Bishops after I had written them, and
consequently nearly all of the acts and legislation of our 
general conferences have been governed by them. I have 
read and passed upon every book in manuscript that has 
been published in our church from its organization until 
the present time, and have written their introductions. 
By authority of the General Conference, I have written 
and compiled the only hymn book and the only Manual 
of Discipline that we have ever had, without any aid 
from the church whatever.</p>
        <p>In 1881 four delegates were selected by the Bishops 
to represent the church in the Ecumenical Conference 
that was held in London, England, and no one went but 
myself. As yet I am the only C. M. E. representative 
that has ever gone to a foreign port on an official errand. 
I read a paper before that splendid and august body 
according to the program. While in London I preached 
in City Road Chapel, the distinguished mother of Methodism, 
from the same little box pulpit from which John
Wesley preached the gospel of free grace. I did what I 
could upon the same great subject. During my stay in 
this the largest city of the world, I preached many times, 
perhaps with more force than I have before or since. On 
this trip to the first Ecumenical Conference of Methodism, 
I visited Paris and spent a week in “sight-seeing,” 
weighing and measuring the world's greatest civilization, 
which no man can know until he comes in contact 
with it. I was delegate to the Centennial Conference of
American Methodism that was held in Baltimore in 1884, 
and wrote a paper that was read in that conference. I 
was not present on account of ill health, but the paper
<pb id="hols29" n="29"/>
was read by Rev. F. M. Hamilton, M. D. I was also a 
member of the last Ecumenical Conference that was 
held in Washington, D. C.</p>
        <p>From 1870 until the present time (1898) I have written 
a great many papers and public communications on the 
history and polity of the church, a large number of which 
have been published in the Christian Index, the official 
organ of the church. I have given the reading public 
the greatest part of what permanent literature the 
church, up to the present time, has been able to produce. 
A great deal of what I have written in the last 
twenty-eight years never has been and never will be published.
Much of it has already been suppressed, the other in all
probability will be. I have often written sermons and 
afterwards destroyed them. This I have regretted, but 
they are gone beyond recalling.</p>
        <p>As orator or writer, philosopher or preacher, I leave 
the estimate of myself to the candid judgment of those 
who have known me. As a citizen I have tried to do the 
right, no matter how far I have come short of it.</p>
        <p>My history is the history of the church of which I am 
a member. Its history cannot be written, nor its records 
compiled without me as one of the chief actors in its 
drama, and one who has deeply impressed himself upon 
its character and productions.</p>
        <p>At present, I am the editor-in-chief of “The Gospel 
Trumpet,” associated with the Rev. R. A. Carter 
A.M., who is the managing editor. I was elected to the 
office of Bishop when I was in my thirtieth year of age, 
and have held the position for twenty-five years. When 
I was elected it was said by some prominent man that 
I was the youngest man ever elected Bishop in any age 
or church.</p>
        <p>I have not sought to get rich, nor make money, and 
have in no way made my office, position, nor the church 
an instrument of power or worldly gain. All that I have 
received above a bare living, I have made it a habit to 
<pb id="hols30" n="30"/>
return to the church, and to help on to a better state
suffering humanity. At this time I have no “cottage in
the wilderness” that I can call my home, and I have been
in debt ever since I have been a Bishop. From youth to
the present, life has been an unremitting struggle and a
perpetual series of trials and conflicts. I have helped
every man, woman and child that I could, and have tried
to bear the burdens of others as the Scriptures direct.</p>

          <head>Man an Ideal Empire in Miniature.</head>
          <epigraph>
            <p>“What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of 
man, that thou visitest him?”—Ps. 8:4.</p>
          </epigraph>
          <p>However small and insignificant man may appear to 
be in physical parts and bodily proportions amid the 
marvelous wonders of creation, and however insignificant 
in weight, height, and girth, when compared with 
the cloud-kissed hills or the towering mountains of eternal 
snows that lift their cones to the cloudless zones, 
and however light and ponderable he may be, compared 
to the infinite masses of tangible materialities that
compose the universe in which he lives and moves, and of 
which he is a part, yet he is an ideal and realistic 
empire within himself. He has not only a realistic and 
enduring <hi rend="italics">self,</hi> but he within himself is a real and ideal 
empire composed of all those powers and elements and 
inherent qualities that seem needful to complete the 
same. As a great steam engine may be built in miniature 
with its wheels, cogs, pulleys, cylinders, boiler, 
steam chests, piston rods, and gear, and as such a 
miniature engine may be as real and as perfect as a great 
engine which it may represent, so man is as perfect an 
empire as the little or model engine is an engine. As 
extension of parts and immensity of materiality have
nothing to do with perfection of quality and character, 
so there need be no real difference in the two engines 
except in degrees. Indeed, man is a perfect creation in 
the fundamental facts and constituent elements of his 
being; and in these respects he is an emanation of the 
Divine. Humanity is divine, not in its moral purity and 
perfection, but in its mental capacity and corporal 
delineations. In everything but moral standing, the mental
humanity is made in the image of its Creator. Man's
<pb id="hols34" n="34"/>
mental humanity is the most real and the most conspicuous,
indeed the only real enduring and essential attribute 
of his being. This mental individuality is in the 
image of God, the Supreme Mentality, that universal 
spirituality whose exterior building is the universe. 
This universe is the temple of God—the empire of the
Supreme Mentality. Somewhere in this temple or
empire, is the seat of universal government, authority, and
power, the central location of one almighty thrilling 
force that acts upon and centralizes all the forces, energies 
and activities of all the universe. Gravitation, so 
called, can be nothing less than the operation of universal 
mentality in perpetual activity, by whose coercive 
energy the mindless elements and their infinitely various 
combinations sustain their harmonious interrelations. 
Thus God is the life and soul of the universe in the same 
sense that man's soul is the life and light of his body.
In this high metaphysical sense God is the life of the 
universe, the life of all the worlds, and the light of men. 
Evidently man is the little God, the microcosm, an image 
of the macrocosm, which is God's larger universe. I 
need not dwell upon the indestructibility of human 
nature. It is as enduring as the ages. The tardy steps 
of centuries and cycles, the abrasions and indentures of 
all eternity, will leave the divinely imaged mental
humanity fresh and green, forever blooming from its own
deathless inherent vitality, because it is the image of 
God. Man's body is the temple of his soul. It is the 
splendid <hi rend="italics">super</hi>-cosmopolite from the cosmopolitan center, 
tenting and dwelling for a season on this sub-lunar 
sphere. Its style and outlines and delineations are from 
heaven. It is the human form divine from the skies. 
The body is materialistic, because there is nothing in
the universe other than matter of which it may be 
composed, and, therefore, desolation and decay shall 
overtake it. Its pillars and columns and towering arches 
shall fall down, and its stately roof and star-crowned
<pb id="hols35" n="35"/>
turrets shall be broken and buried, but the image of 
God—the heavenly Visitant—that dwells within, in all 
its divine completeness and ethereal brightness, shall 
remain intact and untarnished amid the wonders of the 
cycles and the evolutions and transitions of the endless 
future. Truly man shall live forever. Death is simply 
a removal from one sphere of being to another, a shuffling 
off a coarser and earthly coil, and a flight from a 
lower to a higher, purer and sublimer altitude in another
sphere. It is the heavenly mentality abdicating an earthly 
throne, and reascending to its high place to be in 
perfect unison with kindred spirits, and vie in the splendors 
of the ethereal.</p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="italics">I. What is man in his physical constitution?</hi>
          </p>
          <p>The psalmist says, “I am fearfully and wonderfully 
made.” None but God can make man. No angelic 
fingers nor seraphic handicraft, nor wonderful mechanism, 
though contrived and manipulated by the skilful touch 
of angelic operators, can spin into threads and weave in 
golden looms the warp and woof, and manufacture into 
grace and beauty the delicate fabric of which man is 
made. None but God could throw the silver shuttle and
bring from the evolving intricate mechanism of nature 
a mighty product like man. What a wonderful organism 
is this man empire! In this man empire, there are 
two hundred and sixty-three bones, five hundred muscles, 
and three hundred millions of brain cells, about three
thousand of which are destroyed every minute. Therefore, 
every man has a new brain every sixty days. Every
man that has lived to be seventy years of age has had, 
therefore, four hundred and twenty-nine sets of brains. 
Allowing that the average brain weighs sixty ounces, the 
man of seventy years would have had two thousand five 
hundred pounds of the precious thing. Every day there 
are in each head more than four millions of the brain 
cells destroyed and replaced by new ones. The alimentary 
canal is thirty-two feet long. Man has a heart six
<pb id="hols36" n="36"/>
inches in length and four in diameter, beating seventy
times per minute, four thousand two hundred times every
hour, one hundred thousand eight hundred times a day,
and two billion six hundred millions in three score years
and ten. At each beat, two and a half ounces of blood
are thrown out of it at the rate of one hundred and 
seventy-five ounces per minute, six hundred and fifty-six
pounds per hour, seven and a half tons a day, lifting it
two thousand one hundred and twenty-two feet in the
same length of time. We breathe twelve hundred times
an hour, using twenty-four gallons of air a day. The
breathing surface of the lungs is twenty thousand square
inches, equal to the floor space of a room twelve feet
square. There are ten millions of silken cables or nerve
cords that permeate and ramify the man empire, and
center in the brain or the seat of government, making
the greatest army of body-guards that ever defended a
kingdom or assembled upon the field of battle. The 
atmospheric pressure upon each square inch of the human
body is fourteen pounds, making the weight upon a single
human body of medium size forty thousand pounds.
There are three thousand five hundred perspiratory pores,
one-fourth of an inch long, making a little drainage canal
forty miles long. Beyond and beneath all of these there
is the great ganglia system of nerve tissues, so fine and
minute that the point of a sewing-needle covers a whole
system, in which there are thousands of little elastic
threads, too fine to be seen except by glasses of the highest 
magnifying power known to man. Indeed, there are
thousands of wonders and marvels in the physical constitution 
and operations of the human organism that are 
beyond the power of the mind to comprehend and explain.
As God, the Supreme Mentality, presides over the 
universe, governing all its forces under the reign of law, so
man is presided over by the mind, which is the supreme
king of the man empire, governing all its parts and forces
under the reign of law. As God's mind is everywhere in
<pb id="hols37" n="37"/>
the universe as an all powerful and infinite activity, so
the mind of man is everywhere the infinite activity in the
man empire, filling all its parts and ramifications with its
own ineffable light and glorious power. The God empire
and the man empire are images the one of the other. The
first is absolute and infinite in fact and abstract; the 
second is only absolute and infinite within its prescribed
bounds. Both are the same in kind, but different in 
degrees. Therefore, the mind of man is the reigning king,
the monarch and master of the man empire. Hence, man
is an empire in miniature, with all the elements and 
inherent capacities of a kingdom, with its presiding 
monarch highly exalted upon the throne of the brain. Here
lives and rules the mind king from whose dictatorial
throne edicts are issued and commands sent forth into
all the realms, provinces and the ramifications of the 
universal dominions. Indeed, man is an empire, having all
the realms, provinces and the ramifications of the 
universal dominions. Indeed, man is an empire, having all
the elements, forces and powers of nature in co-operative
harmony, with its solids and liquids, and with its flora
and fauna. It has lands, skies, seas, brooks, rivers and
sparkling rills, that convey life and light and vitality to
every part; from its fertile plains and golden fields, the
metropolis and seat of empire draws tribute and support.
The brain is the throne and seat of government and the
mind is monarch. At his command ministers fly, cables
hiss, sinews quiver, fluids dash, bones quake and 
sensations play like electric volts on the strings of the nerves.
The mind king has eyes, ears, hands, feet, lips and
tongue. He is the real and divine personality, the mind
monarch whom God “from old times” has crowned, 
sceptered and clothed with the royal robe and insignia of
state. He has judgment, discretion, tastes, will, choice
and sensibility. Around him are his courtiers, diplomats
and flaming ministers, hung on threads of gold and 
cables of silver, ever ready in reverential attitudes to 
<pb id="hols38" n="38"/>
execute his high behests. By these space is blotted out and 
time annihilated. They fly on wings of thought and 
dance as it were on the lightning's flame, unifying and 
binding the states of empire with his arm of glorious 
power. God's power is absolute, and his government 
executive, ministerial and dictatorial. “He maketh his 
angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.” As the
empire of God moves about his throne as the center of
attraction, so the man empire moves about the brain as 
the center of will force, rule and authority. This man 
empire has reservoirs of blood, lakes of water, rills of 
oil, and repositories of fluids that make up its gulfs, seas, 
inlets and bays. It has cables of elastic steel that thread 
and permeate all its parts, wrapt in silken integuments, 
and of the finest mould. Over these elastic threads and 
living cables, fiery dictates and high behests from the 
throne of the mind king dance and play and preach his
will and proclaim his laws upon every hill, through every 
plain and valley, till every leaflet, rock, and tree, and all 
the deep gorges and mountain passes are resonant with 
his voice and filled with his commands. Deep in its seas 
there are flowing currents and boiling springs, from 
whose agitated waters come pearls of thought, folios of 
science, books of wisdom, bringing up from their hidden 
archives curriculums of study, deeper, vaster, broader 
and higher than ancient sages, approximating the ken of 
angels and the wisdom of seraphs. There are mountains
of bone, hills of cartilage, ledges of gristle, and 
ropes of sinew, to give form and beauty, and hold intact 
the rolling, jostling empire, with its leaping rills, restless 
seas, agitated gulfs and quaking land. It has a 
fertile soil of flesh and blood where roses blush and lilies 
bloom, through which a thousand streamlets flow to 
perpetuate its virgin days of youth, and crown its high
meridian with the flora of light, wisdom, and strength, and 
its hoary years with a diadem of silvery harvest. This 
man empire has its winds, storms, cyclones, hurricanes,
<pb id="hols39" n="39"/>
typhoons and trade-winds, that roar among its caverns, 
whistle along its dales, hum among its rocks, play 
on its seas, shout over its hills, and strew its valleys 
with awful wreckage and direful ruins of uprooted 
forests. This man empire has its sun, the central luminary, 
meting its days and years, shining over its hemispheres, 
continents, seas and islands, giving light and life to its 
flora and fauna, producing towering trees of knowledge 
on its mountains of wisdom, from whose sunny peaks the 
mind king makes the sunbeams his horses and the ethereal 
currents his chariot wheels. Or through the lofty 
constellations of judgment, discovery, and golden thought 
he flies toward God until his wings of flame sets aglow 
all the widespread areas of air, sea, and land, until the 
lakes and rivers and island homes are filled with the life 
of God, the anthem of the ages and the symphonies of 
the skies, until every granite bone, elastic cord, and nerve
cable is filled with heaven, and suffused with songs of 
seraphs and the melodies of the spheres. In orbital 
grandeur, around the miniature empire's sun shine the 
satellites of truth, virtue, will, purpose and the designs 
of life, while each planetoid of disease—the fragment 
of broken worlds—“walketh in darkness” through its
cities, states and provinces, corrupting its fountains,
contaminating its seas, and planting the baleful seeds of 
death and dissolution along its flowing currents and 
prolific soils. By flying fragments of broken worlds many 
upheavals occur. Rivers overflow their banks, seas 
forsake their ancient beds, volcanoes explode, islands are 
submerged, mountains quiver on their rocky foundations, 
isthmuses sink, the land quivers while all its elements 
groan at the approach of the great catastrophe—death.
Yea, by these fragments of broken worlds (diseases) many 
a joint is dislocated, cables of elastic steel are broken, 
and silken links of ligaments, sinews of brass, and bones 
of granite yield amid the general “wreck of matter and 
the crush of worlds.” But the text says, “When I 
<pb id="hols40" n="40"/>
consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and
the stars which thou hast ordained; What is man, that
thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou
visitest him.”</p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="italics">II. What is man in his spiritual or mental nature?</hi>
          </p>
          <p>Whence came he? It is said there is nothing great in
the world but man, and there is nothing great in man
but mind. Indeed mind is the man—the true hidden
man that thinks, conceives, judges and forms mental
images; measures time and space, calculates in numbers,
weighs even the imponderable masses of materialities,
comprehends the sublime majesties of the universe, and
has the power of will, choice, taste and thought, and 
indefinite continuity of individual consciousness. Deeply
pervading all the attributes of his nature, the faculty of
imagination like an angel of flame in splendid trim, with
his golden sandals buckled on his feet, is ever ready to
sweep the azure floors of the skies, or pierce the illimitable 
bounds beyond, where planets, stars and suns revolve
on their rounds. By this faculty space is blotted out and
time annihilated. It is swifter than lightning, faster
than electricity and outflies its volts that dance, as it
were, on ethereal vibrations. In a moment, in the twinkling 
of an eye this cherub of the airy deep leaps heavenward or 
hellward, rejoicing in the happiness of the saved,
or revolting at the horrors of the lost millions. It sweeps
the tracks of lesser stars, pierces the orbits of planets,
the belted splendors of Jupiter, the golden rings of 
Saturn, and visits “Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the
chambers of the South,” and wraps itself in the fiery
sheets of the sun. It delights to flee through “The
Milky Way” and the gem studded and constellated highways 
of God. Above stars, planets, suns, in the zoneless 
seas and unhorizoned spheres where the wings of
seraphs battle for decades with the tides, the imagination 
lingers not, but lifting its fiery eye as system after

“On to Alcyon, on to Alcyon,” the greatest system known
to man, and which once seemed to be the center of 
universal power, and the place of the throne of the Most
High. Here alone, at the throne of God, this wonderful
faculty is foiled and baffled, but still radiant in its glory;
and virgin strength. The wings of this mighty visitant
can carry thought no farther. Here all ends meet and
all explorations end. And here she cries—</p>

            <hi rend="italics">III. But what is man in his moral constitution?</hi>
          </p>
          <p>Man is a sinner, for the “Scriptures of Truth” declare
that “All men have sinned and come short of the glory
of God.” Again, “Sin is the transgression of the law.”
Not a visionary or arbitrary command, but it is the 
violation of the law, the high, holy, and eternal law that
governs the mental and moral universe. The law here
spoken of is the embodiment of those underlying principles 
by which the universe is governed, and by which
it maintains its successive and harmonious relations.
By this law all of its elements, physical, and mental, act
in concord. Whoever violates this law, or, if you will,
these laws, is a sinner, a sinner against God and against
<pb id="hols42" n="42"/>
all those spiritual beings, or mental individualities that 
have kept the laws of God, and thereby maintained their 
perfect estate. But this man empire, like others in 
which there is sin, is in perpetual throes, discord, and 
agitation, through all the years of its sublunar existence. 
Its restless inhabitants, with its rebellious states and
provinces, constantly threaten the dissolution and 
subversion of its earthly domains. They threaten to 
transplant their interests and move the seat of empire to 
sublimer realms in those sunny plains of eternal day, where 
they may vie in the altitudes and majesties that live in 
their bright abodes. On earth storms arise upon the 
empire's seas, cyclones move and twist its mountains 
upon their rocky bases, shake its hills, sweep down its
forests, filling its plains and valleys with howling 
destruction and the broken ruins of his kingdom. This is
dying, so-called. As the mind king doffs his crown, lays 
aside his royal insignia of state, drops the sceptre and 
abdicates the throne, the silken cables and elastic cords 
break, the chambers of the king's palace are closed. All 
his courtiers, diplomats and flaming ministers cease to 
do his biddings and sink in eternal muteness. The nerve 
centers with their ten millions of body-guards in 
decadence die. On come the whirlwinds of death, over 
the coagulated seas of blood, up the streamlets of oil and 
channels of fluids. It climbs the vertebrated stairs of 
the spiral mountain of sinews and the hills of cartilages, 
crushing the granite of bones and scattering the parts of 
the magnificent pile. Its sun ceases to shine, its moon is 
turned to blood and all the stars of his lofty firmament 
are covered with the thick blackness of the night. The 
kingdom is demolished and the strength of the empire 
broken; but “the soul of man, Jehovah's breath,” like 
an eagle from its cage, soars away on its wings of flame 
to dwell with God, to live and reign with Jesus, the 
Christ, “and through eternal ages will shout beyond 
the skies.”</p>

          <head>The Irrepressible Conflict.</head>
          <epigraph>
            <p>“For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might 
destroy the works of the devil.” 1 John III:8.</p>
          </epigraph>
          <p>The text brings before us the two most conspicuous 
and renowned characters that have ever appeared in 
the world, acted upon the theatre of life or written their 
deeds upon the scroll of the ages. The annals of the 
ancients and the records of the nations cannot produce 
their equals in the least degree whatever. Indeed they
stand out in bold relief of character and incomparable 
individuality. In their respective relations and natures, 
they are without a compeer. If all the greatness of 
mankind that has been displayed in the wisdom of the 
sages, the sagacity of statesmen, the valor and prowess 
of heroes, the sweetness of poets, the melodies of 
bards, were compressed into one great personality, he 
could not be so great, so wonderful, so matchless in 
consummate skill, profound wisdom, and exhaustless 
resources of those principles and things that make up the 
sum of greatness, as to rival the great characters 
mentioned in the text. Add to the control of such a 
personality, the rubies of kings, the diamonds of queens, 
the scepters of emperors, the gems and gold of princes, 
the sacerdotal scarlet of popes, the royal splendors of 
imperial courts, and the wealth of the ages and nations, 
yet such a character could not be compared to either of 
the distinguished individuals mentioned in the text. 
Then give such an individual a thousand years to display 
all this mighty wealth and dazzling splendor, yet in 
celebrity and influence, he could not approximate the 
ideal representatives of the irrepressible conflict—the 
Son of God and the devil. They both occupy the most 
exalted, lofty and most conspicuous position in the
<pb id="hols44" n="44"/>
world, and in their work, influence and relations, they 
affect every nation, people, tongue and age. Their 
influence runs parallel with all times, epochs, and 
dispensations, ramifying all human governments, institutions, 
orders, fraternities and administrations. They affect 
the administration of all civil laws and the adjudication 
of every lawsuit. The one or the other has paved the 
pathway of every war, feud, conflict and revolution
that has swept the zones of human civilizations, and 
fixed the destiny of men and nations. They affect all 
events in the world's written and unwritten history; 
from its incipient civilization and birthday, until in 
the sable drapery of its solemn requiem, the world 
shall cease to be aglow with the burning cinders that 
fly from the two great swords of Beelzebub and the 
conquering Messiah. Their influence stops not in time, 
but crosses the dark and trackless sea of death, and, 
rekindling on the shores of the spiritual world, will 
continue through all the great millenniums of eternal 
duration. Heaven and hell, with their crowded intelligences, 
will feel their potent and lavish influence by which
their unnumbered billions of indestructible individualities 
will be forever swayed. Their imprint of character, 
for good or for evil, for hell or for heaven, for life or for 
death, will be made and deeply engraved upon the life 
and spiritual nature of every man, woman and child that 
has ever lived, or ever will live. They are not private 
but public individuals—federal heads—and representatives 
and embodiments of the two great diversities of
the moral universe—good and evil. They are the 
representatives and heroes of the two great spiritual empires 
of the world, representing the two great moral ideas of 
the universe, which are founded upon the immortal 
principles of right and wrong, and of truth and falsehood, 
and of life and death. There is an infinite distinctiveness 
—constitutional, innate and irrevocable—between these
two individuals, in their nature, work and the great 
<pb id="hols45" n="45"/>
outcome of their career. This difference is essential, 
absolute and necessary. Therefore, it is as much impossible 
to operate them together in harmony upon the same plane 
so as to produce the same results, as it is to bring the 
north and south poles together. They are not only 
antagonistic, but antipodal. Two distinct principles
inspire the work of the one, and the efforts of the other. 
The one is the principle of good and heaven, and the 
other is the principle of evil and hell, each in battle array, 
and perpetual conflict. The one is from heaven and the 
other from hell; one is life, and the other death; one is 
eternal happiness, the other eternal misery; one is 
of God and godly, the other is of the devil and devilish; 
one seeks the good of all, and one the death 
of all; one dignifies and deifies human nature, the other 
strips man of his glory, and leaves his prostrate form on 
the ground—“a splendid palace in ruin.” Ever since sin 
hath entered into the world, and death by sin, these two
great leaders and powers have exhibited themselves 
in the children of men in all the departments and diversified 
features of human society. In the courts of kings, 
in the palace garden, in the halls of justice, on the 
rostrum, in the realms of legislation, in commerce, field, and 
store, their prowess is seen. On the battlefield, in prisons 
and camps of horrid war, in the diplomatic circles, 
and stealthily along the quiet veins and avenues of 
thought and learning, all along, and everywhere, these 
two great majestic powers and principles confront each 
other and beset humanity round about. Hence, they have 
made the children of men good or bad, right or wrong, 
lifting them to heaven, or casting them down to hell. 
Therefore, whatsoever exists in the moral world, exists
under the generic terms of <hi rend="italics">good</hi> and of <hi rend="italics">evil.</hi> Whatever 
is good is not evil, and whatever is evil is not good. Good 
cannot produce evil and evil cannot produce good. Life 
cannot produce death and death cannot produce life. 
Out of the depths of falsehood and darkness arise no
<pb id="hols46" n="46"/>
truth and light, and out of the depths of truth and light 
come no darkness and no untruth. Darkness flees before 
approaching light, and falsehood loses hold when truth 
enters. Both cannot fill the same moral space at the 
same time, because they are moral spheres, filling the 
utmost limits of the mighty circles of the moral universe.</p>
          <p>But to our conception, good and evil are best known
by their effects upon those who follow the one, and 
pursue the other. If certain actions of moral creatures—
whether they be men or angels—render them happy or
miserable, we know that those actions are good or evil,
and spring from the good or the evil one. The practice
of the two principles, in their respective relations and
tendencies, always and forever produces and reproduces
the same results in every case. They are eternal evolutions, 
but their evolutions never evolve out of themselves 
so as to produce something different from 
themselves. They produce their own likeness and 
superscription. Heaven is heaven, and hell is hell, a thousand 
times so in all their intrinsic natures throughout
eternal duration. Good redeems her children, washes
them clean and white in the blood of the Lamb, and sends
them up the shining way to God and gives them the 
endless felicity of heaven. But evil, hideous, dark, and
treacherous, sends her multitudinous squadrons to hell,
giving them the misery that hath no end. Every word
and work of men and angels, is, therefore, significant.
There is a meaning, deep, profound, and far-reaching in
every word, thought, and deed that enters the broad
realm of being. Our thoughts chisel their forms upon
the disc of the soul. Our words are written upon the
folds of the heart, and our actions are the pent-up fires
that leap out, leaving the dead volcanic cinders within.
Like causes produce like effects, and like effects are 
produced by like causes. For every effect there must be a
cause, and the cause is best understood by the results.
In the moral world this is a truism. Now, every moral
<pb id="hols47" n="47"/>
action that takes place among intelligent beings, is 
actuated by, and receives its momentum from the will and 
volition. The will is the motive power—the sheet anchor 
of the soul—that moves and stimulates the actions. 
Therefore, every moral action must have the consent of 
the will, otherwise they cannot be moral actions for 
which men and angels are responsible. All actions, 
therefore, are good or evil, and must be classified as such. 
The former lead to heaven, the latter lead to hell. At 
the end of every man's road stands life or death, hell or 
heaven, which is the inevitable and final destiny of all 
the living. When the sundering blade of death shall cut 
the vital threads of life, the soul—the heaving 
spirit—emancipated from its house of clay, shall then be 
transported away and up to God, or away and down to hell, 
and the day of preparation shall then be closed, when 
the inexorable fiat of Almighty God shall forever seal 
the irrevocable life of the one, and the changeless
damnation of the other. No man can tell where hell is, but 
it <hi rend="italics">is,</hi> it does exist, and whatever it is, and wherever it is, 
is a matter of small moment. But we are certain of two 
things: (1)  It is a state and place of punishment. (2)  
That punishment is eternal in its duration. This 
arises out of the nature of the case, and the nature of 
God's government. When the sinner lands in hell, he 
will then be nearer to God, heaven, and life, than he will 
ever be again in all the cycles and evolving millenniums of 
eternity. Every surging wave and fleeing current of rolling 
years, will thrust him farther and farther out into 
the mid-ocean of hell's seething and boiling billows. 
Every turn of the wheel of the centuries will but augment
his sins, and enlarge his capacity for transgression and 
sink him lower and lower.</p>
          <p>Man is a progressive being. Progression—eternal 
progression—characterizes his innate constituency whether 
in the human body or out of it; whether in a state of bliss 
or state of misery; whether in earth, heaven or hell, or
<pb id="hols48" n="48"/>
whether as applied to the three realities of his 
nature—physical, moral and mental. 
Change of place or condition
cannot change his nature and indestructible selfhood or
spiritual identity. Man is man in all the relations and
conditions in which he may be placed. The immortal
mind, the conscious self, with all the moral sensibilities,
are incapable of decay, and therefore, of necessity, he is
eternal in conscious duration. It seems, also, a truism,
that the functions of the moral and mental man are never
in a state of perfect quietism. There is a perpetual 
unrest, or rather there is rest only in motion, progression,
and development. Absolute quietism is incompatible
with life, and there can be no such thing as vital energies
in absolute quietude. Activity, in a greater or less 
degree, is the law of all living and is operative in all intelligent 
beings, whether in a state of bliss or state of woe.
The saved will continue in obedience, the lost will 
continue in sin, since mere punishment has no redeeming
qualities, and since obedience has no element of misery.
As one wave of the sea produces another, and these 
produce others indefinitely, so one act of sin produces others
through the eternal rounds of the dreadful series of
transgressions. One hell will rise above and crowd the
burning crest of another, each more dreadful and pressing 
harder upon the heels of the other, adding force and
fury to the mighty avalanche of the fiery flood.</p>
          <p>This text, like others, gives us the key to the origin of 
evil in the world, a question long debated by “the wise 
and prudent,” and philosophic schools of the ancients. 
“The devil sinneth from the beginning,” “for in the day 
that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die,” is the 
plain declaration of holy writ. Long was the world in 
darkness on this subject, and many were the vain and
absurd theories entertained by the wisest of human kind. 
They were greatly troubled, puzzled, and bewildered to 
account for the advent and work of evil in the world. 
The fertile imagination of the ancient thinker set about
<pb id="hols49" n="49"/>
to invent theories and invest probabilities with the 
habiliments of truth, hoping thereby to explain the 
mystery. Hence, the <hi rend="italics">necessitarians</hi> tell us that evil arises out 
of the nature and constitution of things; and that the 
Creator himself could not hinder its manifestation in the 
world. The <hi rend="italics">Manichean</hi> theory is that there are two 
deities, the one good and the other evil; one the author 
of the body and the other the author of the soul; and
that, therefore, the body is evil because it comes from 
the evil deity, and that the soul is good because it comes 
from the good deity. How absurd! But this is the 
result of human wisdom, when it sets at naught the word 
of God. “In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt 
surely die.” This positive command, given to Adam by 
the Creator, placed him, as a free moral agent in a state 
of probation and trial, clothing him with power to stand, 
yet liable to fall, because he could not be free as an agent 
unless it was in his choice to obey or disobey. But he 
fell. He “kept not” his first estate. By the influence 
of the devil, he became a sinner, “and brought death 
into the world and all our woes,” because:
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“She plucked, she ate,</l><l>Earth felt the wound,</l><l>And nature from her seat,</l><l>Gave signs of woe,</l><l>That all was lost,”</l></lg></q></p>
          <p>Thus sin entered into the world, and death by sin. 
Death, with all his howling furies came in pompous state, 
drawing the dreadful phalanxes of hell at his chariot 
wheels. Here then is that long and dreadful reign of 
the king of hell, called in Genesis, “The seed of the 
serpent.” The declarations of the Scriptures, his natural 
character, and his real work in the world, prove that he 
is a real being, possessing individuality, and identity of 
personality. He is endowed with all the properties and 
characteristics that constitute an intelligent being. He 
is not the principle of evil personified, as some would 
have it to be, by assigning to it all the qualities and 
<pb id="hols50" n="50"/>
actions of an individual. He is not a mere myth, a fable
or fabulous being—the outgrowth of man's fear, or product 
of human imagination. He is not an allegorical
being without body or parts, but he is a great and astute
being, mighty in power, skilled in wisdom, profound in
knowledge and is thoroughly acquainted with the history
of the world and the acts of the nations. In Genesis
(3:15) he is the seed of “the serpent,” and the singular
personal pronoun is used to describe his personality and
unity of being. In Job he is called “Satan,” the adversary, 
the great enemy of God. He is called “the prince
of this world” (John 10:31), “The prince of the power
of the air” (Eph. 2:2). He is “a roaring lion seeking
whom he may devour.” He is called “the God of this
world” (2 Cor. 4:4). He is said to be a “murderer from
the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there
is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie he speaketh
of that which is his own: for he is a liar and the father
of it” (John 8:44). In Revelation he is the king of hell,
for says the Apostle, “And they had a king over them,
which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in
the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue
hath his name Apollyon” (Rev. 9:1.1). Moses, the venerable 
lawgiver of Israel was well known by the Devil. He
knew also his relation to God and to Israel, and that
Israel venerated him above all men living or dead. But
Moses died, and was buried in the land of Moab, in a
valley over against Beth-peor. Satan knowing that
Moses was dead went in search of his body, that if 
possible, he might devise some plan by which the body
might be given to the children of Israel, that they might
fall down and worship the lifeless corpse of a great man,
as was the custom in Egypt, and thus bring down the
wrath of God upon Israel, and nip the plan of salvation
in the bud. But God in his goodness, foreseeing what
would follow, placed an archangel there to watch over
the body, and defend it against the violence and intrigue
<pb id="hols51" n="51"/>
of hell's greatest legate. This is the work of a character, 
and the diplomacy of hell.</p>
          <p>St. Peter declares that “God spared not the angels 
that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered 
them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment” 
(2 Peter 2:4). Jude substantially declares the 
same thing, using almost the same words. From these, 
and similar passages of Scripture, we learn:</p>
          <p>1. That the Devil is not a principle personified, but 
that he is a real substantial and individual character.</p>
          <p>2. That he was in a state of happiness and probation 
—under positive law, well understood by him, and his 
fellows, or “the angels that sinned” and “kept not their 
first estate.”</p>
          <p>3. That he rebelled, or “sinned” against the laws of 
God and the government of heaven, and thereby lost his 
first estate and was cast “down to hell and delivered into 
chains of darkness,” awaiting the just vengeance of the 
judgment day of Almighty God.</p>
          <p>4. That he is a powerful prince, a mighty king and a 
great captain with an empire of spiritual darkness of 
immense proportions, and that he stirs the hearts and 
minds, and works through and in the children of 
disobedience.</p>
          <p>Let us study his nature, work, and history, its it is 
written in the history of the world. He is wise, astute, 
stalwart. Standing up like a spiritual giant of massive 
proportions, and roaring like a lion when he thirsts for 
blood, he sounds his clarion voice which, like an electric 
shock, flashes along all the zones and parallels of the 
habitable earth, convulsing the nations, and spreading 
far an intensive discord through all the tribes of men.
His footprint and handiwork is seen and felt in every land, 
state, and age—wherever men live and die. The 
operations of his hand are simply marvelous—dark deep, 
intricate, and profound. His devices are multiplex and 
serpentine. His aim is one. He lives through the ages
<pb id="hols52" n="52"/>
with illustrious strength and indomitable will that 
forever spring with elastic and virgin strength which nerves
his spirit and inspires his obdurate soul with a fiery
zeal that “no langour knows.” Changes in the world of
man make no changes with him. Yoking the whirlwinds 
to his rolling car he traverses the misty deep, plods
and plows the surging seas, and as a bold corsair in quest
of treasures new and old, he seeks the heathen in his 
jungle heath island home to pour hell and denser darkness
upon his moral and mental day. He throws the somber
pall of sin and death high upon the disc of his shield,
while his black pinions shade and darken the path and
contract the highway of the world's civilizations. As a
warrior, he stands at the head and is the dictator of a
multitudinous, powerful, and well organized army, <sic corr="equipped">epuipped</sic> 
and skilled in all the military tactics of diabolical
and spiritual warfare. His soldiers are the bold spirits,
the thunder-driven and hell-bred legions from the infernal 
cave of the damned that kept not their first estate;
being goaded on by the hell in their conscience, they are
ever ready for the scenes of war and carnage. The weapons 
of their warfare are mighty, formidable and tried
upon the spiritual battle-fields of the nations and ages.
Each soldier-devil is armed with barbed spears and
swords of adamantine steel whose dreadful play in the
air shows that they are in the hands of spirits bold and
spirits daring. Their quivers are filled with winged 
arrows, polished and tempered, and tipped with poison of
asps and venom of serpents. Precision and dexterity
characterize the engagements of these diabolical archers
and sharpshooters of hell. But open war is resorted
to only when cunning and intrigue fail. The devil
is great in cunning and <sic corr="stratagem">strategem</sic>. Hence the Apostle 
tells us that “we are not ignorant of his devices.”
He stirs the passions, lust and pride, and the baser
nature of kings, princes, rulers and potentates, and
perpetually foments civil and national strife among the
<pb id="hols53" n="53"/>
nations of the earth, causing the plowshare of 
destruction to glide through the flourishing fields of human
society, unroofing the temples, of civilizations and flooding 
their open halls with human gore, and piling
high around their fluted columns the broken bones
and bleeding bodies of the dead and dying, causing the
widow to weep and the orphan to sigh and clamor for
bread. Often he seeks his seat in the church of God,
throwing discord and confusion among the saints of the
Most High. He is not omnipotent, nor omnipresent, but
mighty, and is the antipodal force and antagonistic power
against Christ, God and humanity. Messiah on the one
side and the devil on the other are great leaders and 
captains. The battle began in the Garden of Eden six 
thousand years ago. Both have had varying success and 
defeats upon the arena of the nation and rostrum of the
ages. Still the battle rages. Neither has entirely defeated 
the other, but onward and fiercely rolls the battle cry.
But hush! hush!! I hear the silver notes of the golden
clarion of Messiah coming with martial tread and haughty 
tramp. He is “clothed in a vesture dipped in blood.”
He rides upon the great white horse of truth and on his
head are “many crowns.” By his side hangs a potent
double-edged blade of “heavenly temper keen” that never
turns back from the blood of the slain. His armies are
upon white horses robed in the bright and shilling habiliments 
of divine purity. Their swords are forged upon the
anvil of God in “the house of David,” and made of the
best old Jerusalem steel dug out of the mountains of God.
Other blades may break or shatter, but these never.
Dreadful are the incisions they make in the rank and file
of the enemy. “How shall one chase a thousand and two
put ten thousand to flight?” “For the weapons of
their warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God
to the pulling down of the stronghold of the devil.”
Christ cannot fail. Hell is great, but heaven is greater.
Christ is rich in all the fathomless depths and endless
<pb id="hols54" n="54"/>
heights of eternal power. He is more than a match for 
the Devil. “He is the same to-day and yesterday and 
forever,” and on through the eternal series of great and 
glorious achievements he repeats his mighty deeds and 
stupendous acquisitions in the redemption scheme. 
While this and more is true, yet dark and dreadful were 
the closing scenes of the world's greatest drama, for it 
is said in Genesis by the mouth of God, “Thou shalt 
bruise his heel.” The “Thou” here spoken of is the Devil 
himself, and the expression comes from the custom of 
pursuing an enemy so closely that the heels of the fleeing 
are trod upon by the front part of the foot of the 
pursuer. This implies that the contest was to be close, fearful 
and irrepressible, and that Satan would pursue the 
Son of God even to the gates of death. This is also the
turning point in the great and long struggle for the 
mastery, and the ascending of the one over the other. 
Here the Son of God must conquer or be conquered. 
Here he must rise victorious over the power of darkness, 
or he must fall under shame and defeat. Christ says, 
“The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in 
me.” He felt the dreadful tread of Satan crowding upon
“his heels,” while his steps in the Garden of Gethsemane 
were marked with his own blood, sweat, and tears. He 
felt the powers of hell surrounding him on every side 
and hedging in the pathway of the Son of God. Four 
thousand years of conflict had passed, but now the 
culminating hour is reached at last. Now is the dreadful hour 
when his strength and power are tried and hope flickers 
in the golden sockets of life. Now the Redeemer of the
world was to stand off no longer, and from the red mouth 
of heaven's artillery rain hail and burning thunderbolts 
upon the hideous head of the demon; but he must meet 
him face to face, and arm to arm, and measure swords 
and spears. Ten thousand devils peep up from the 
bottomless pit and hiss and howl and clamor for the blood 
of the Son of God. Swift winged messengers pass in
<pb id="hols55" n="55"/>
rapid transition from earth to hell, and also from earth 
to heaven, bearing dispatches and news of the dreadful 
hour and of the culminating scenes of the great and 
irrepressible conflict. O, dreadful hour, fraught with life 
or death for the millions of the sin enslaved of Adam's 
race! The Son of God now falls upon his knees upon the 
cold ground, while his humanity passes through the fearful 
ordeal and crucial test and the augmented sorrows of
the ages, but amid anguish, pains, sorrows and temptations, 
he says, “My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto 
death.” The sins of the world were upon him, and for 
that reason he must be fearfully chastised by the hand
of his Father. But he went a little farther, and fell on 
his face and prayed, saying, “O, my Father, if it be possible, 
let this cup pass from me! nevertheless, not as I
will, but as thou wilt.” This prayer he prayed three 
times. He begins to sweat blood and bleed at every 
pore, and his tears thrown up from the depths of an aching 
heart fell in Gethsemane's Garden. Not only his 
body, but his <hi rend="italics">soul,</hi> the intelligent, the sensitive inner 
man, was “exceedingly sorrowful even unto death.” 
How deep was that sorrow, and how painful the
situation! He looked up, and behold, Judas with his band 
of ruffians came with swords and staves, and the Son of 
man is betrayed into the hand of sinners and taken to the 
judgment seat of the wicked. “Surely he hath borne 
our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem 
him stricken, smitten of God and afflicted.” Having 
ascended the hill of sacrificial death, he is nailed to the 
cross. The rough iron spikes pierce his feet and hands, 
and he is cruelly transfixed to the rugged wood. Every
sinew is stretched, every tendon distended, every joint
dislocated, and every nerve cable thrills with pain. Here 
hangs in agony and blood the Prince of Peace, the incarnate 
Son of God, the Alpha and the Omega of all creation. 
But he dies! “It is finished.” But the great tragedy is 
not yet ended. Another scene is yet to be acted In the
<pb id="hols56" n="56"/>
world's greatest drama. Joseph of Arimathea deposits 
the dead body in his new tomb. The disciples scattered 
and all seemed lost. Nature by her internal throes “gave 
signs of woe.” Hell laughs and shouts in triumph. 
Hope seemed fled away. upon the dying zephyrs of the 
last breath of the expiring Messiah. But on the third 
day, Messiah calls back and, resumes his ancient power. 
The bars, bolts, and rock-ribbed jaws of the grave began
to swell and heave as if moved by the omnific hand of 
God. Death and hell heard the rattling chariot wheels 
of the heavenly legates as they leaped from the heavenly 
gates and fled to the rescue of the sleeping Jesus. They 
pour the message of life from God into the dungeon of 
death, and the Son of God rises from the dead. Heaven 
laughs, hell is astonished, and, universal humanity is 
thrilled by the triumphal declaration: “I am he that
liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive forever more, 
amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.”</p>

          <epigraph>
            <p>“I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to 
the wise and to the unwise.”—Rom. 1:14.</p>
          </epigraph>
          <p>From the language of the text, it is evident that the
great Apostle to the Gentiles designed to represent or
set forth the universal family of man as one whole and
perfect race in so far as a common humanity goes. But
when he comes to consider the civil, social and religious
status of humanity, he divides mankind into two very
distinct divisions, and grades the human race under the
appellation of “the Greeks,” and “the Barbarians.” This
view of the apostolic idea is emphasized and paraphrased
by the words, “The wise and the unwise.” Hence, the
difference between “the Greeks” and “the Barbarians”
is a state or condition, and not a fundamental. The difference 
between the two representative specimens of the
human family here presented is not constitutional or 
inherent in the nature of man; but the evident or manifest
superiority of the one over the other, grew out of those
conditions, elements, and phases of civil and religious life
that proceed upon natural law, and have always 
characterized, to a great or less extent, the race of mankind.
Whatever aspect of human progress or retrogression
has presented itself to the student of ethnical science
and the philosophy of history, nothing founded on 
bottom facts warrants the conclusion that one man is, by
nature and certainly not by grace, superior to the other.
But there is a common humanity with a common interest, 
destiny and parentage that unify all the nations
and peoples of the earth. Manners, habits, customs, the
forms of governments and civil institutions change 
according to the tastes of men and the evolutions of human
<pb id="hols58" n="58"/>
nature; but the innate manhood knows no change in that
sense whereby one man or people is made inherently
superior to the other. Human nature is found by experience 
as well as by history and philosophy to be the same
in quality and essentials, in all ages, states and 
conditions. State or condition, whether national, racial, or
personal, has nothing to do with those great immortal
and high mental parts or constituencies that belong to
the human individualism. All men are created with the
same number of mental faculties, the same number of
those attributes of mental and physical parts that have
characterized all the individuals of the race from its 
inception in the Garden of Eden to the present day.
Neither does time, in its steady and onward flow through
the centuries, nor do those advancing and changing forms
of government under which man has lived, have any
tendency to change his innate nature in the slightest
degree whatever. No improvement in civilized life, no
matter how far and how high it may advance the human
character in the scale of progress, can add to or take from
man one single faculty of his nature. So far as the kind
and number of the human faculties are concerned, they
are complete. And it seems that his present number of 
faculties is sufficient to put him and keep him in touch 
with the spiritual, mental and physical universe by which 
he is surrounded, and of which he is a part, as well as a
citizen. The capacity to do and to know and to comprehend 
the phenomena of mind and matter on this plane of 
life, or it may be even in the life to come, does not demand 
new faculties or other innate constituencies, but only the 
culture, the development and the indefinite expansion of
those that now belong to him. At present, man seems to 
be in the morning twilight of his being. He is on the 
inclined plane from the days of his infancy, ascending those 
loftier graded altitudes of perfections of being and character 
that are demanded by the very nature of his existence.
But so far as the real attributes of his nature
<pb id="hols59" n="59"/>
are concerned in their deepest and broadest realisms, 
there will be no more change in him than there is 
between the man when he is an infant and the same man 
when he is grown to riper years. In the growth, training
and culture of such an individual, great changes have 
taken place. His body has grown, enlarged and taken on 
its majesty, beauty and stateliness. His mind has been 
cultured and all the faculties have become active, keen
and incisive, and with the fulness of a finished and 
rounded manhood, he is far different from what he was 
when lulled to sleep by the sweet, soft melody of a 
mother's song. But mark you, he is the same individual. 
There has been added no new nature, attribute or
faculty, either in his physical or mental being, but he 
is the same character with the added expansions and 
developments of the human essentials. It denotes progress 
in the potentialities of the mental and immortal 
humanity that constitute the real man, whose continuity
of consciousness is eternal. If these statements are not 
true, then man's identity is not possible, and his moral
obligations with his moral nature are destroyed, and 
there can be no punishments or rewards. Indeed, man is 
man wherever found, with the same connections, relations
and affinities of life and character. Every man is made
by the same hand, according to the measure, mental 
contour and personal and original endowments. Neither 
can racial distinctions, color, climatic or geographical
situation of birth and growth make any difference in the
characteristics of his real manhood. This proves the 
unity of the race of man, the oneness of interest, origin 
and destiny. What, therefore, is possible for one man 
is possible for all men under the same conditions and 
circumstances. All are made in “the image of God,” 
after the same pattern, in the sublime fundamentals of 
the original. Hence the great Apostle says: “I am 
debtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians, both 
to the wise and to the unwise.” In plain words, “I am
<pb id="hols60" n="60"/>
in debt to all men, whether they be the polished, 
educated, and refined philosophic Greeks, or the crude, wild 
and untutored Barbarians.” Again, there is but one 
religion for all men. There is one God and Saviour—“Jesus 
Christ, the same yesterday and to-day and forever.” God 
has presented to mankind but one living, active and 
forceful Christianity which is adapted to all states, ages, 
and conditions of universal intelligence. God has adapted
its requirements, tenets, doctrines, practices and all 
its splendid elements and agencies to reach and save his 
intelligent offsprings in any and in all the possibilities 
of life and human probation.</p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="italics">I. What then is the greatest work to be done under heaven?</hi>
          </p>
          <p>Answer: To save both the polished Greek and the ignorant
Barbarian. Both have souls that must be redeemed 
or lost. This is a great work, the greatest that can be 
done by men or angels. For this the great universal 
church of God was established in the earth. For this 
the great world of man has groaned, oppressed beneath 
the heavy and sable bands that beclouded as with a 
heavy laden pall of death his social and civil horizon in 
the dreary and sluggish moving centuries of the past.
But dead centuries cannot save, nor sleeping cycles 
atone for the sins and transgressions of men. Time can 
do nothing of itself without the superior power and 
agency of the Son of God. We are all debtors one to all 
the others, and all the others are indebted to that one. 
God demands of all men to do all that they can to save 
the race of man from sin. Our duty, in this respect, is
never accomplished until we have done our best to reach 
the ends of the salvation of the one and universal 
humanity. All the great works, achievements, and wonderful 
discoveries of the centuries cannot be compared 
to the work of redemption. Man is lost. The vital 
threads and living strings that played in harmonious 
relation between heaven and earth, threading and thrilling 
the deep ethereal seas, were broken off by the cruel
<pb id="hols61" n="61"/>
hand of sin. Somewhere in the great ocean between God 
and man, the ends of the broken cables lie buried in some 
vast depth, sleeping embedded amid the unfathomable 
mysteries in the wonders and <sic corr="plenitudes">plentitudes</sic> of those awful 
seas of pandemonic and howling space. Over these 
broad seas of unfathomable depths, tented Night threw 
her canopy of thick darkness, heavier than mountains 
of iron and stronger than hills of brass, over which the
thunders of God and the winged lightnings of wrath 
played in gorgeous and awful splendors filling the space 
of empire between God and man with all the obstructive 
elements, agencies, and forces of sin and disobedience. 
No seraphs bold, nor angels daring, ever penetrated the 
darkened highways or flashed on flaming pinions over the 
howling seas, gyral cataracts and leaping billows of that 
wide and black waste that divided the empire of sin from 
the empire of life. Man is lost. The planet on which he
lives has broken her moral relations with God, life and 
glory. The silver cables and steel chains whose adamantine 
links were older than the angels and stronger than 
the cycles and more wondrous than the centuries have 
been broken. The rebellious planet is lost somewhere 
in “the void immense,” and rolling away far from God
and peace she wheels her flight covered with the thick 
and unyielding nebulæ of sin. God strikes the keys of 
the diapason of being, and all the cords, pulleys, wheels 
and threads of the universal mechanism are still attuned 
but one. He strikes again all the keys, and pulls all the 
lines and threads of the infinite and universal mechanism 
and all respond to their God and their Maker but one. 
There is a harsh sound, a broken thread that causes a 
discordant note in the mechanism of the moral universe,
breaking the melodies of the centuries, the harmonies 
of millenniums, and severing from the throne of God and 
the bosom of his love an alien planet. The cables break, 
heaven feels the tremor, and the rocking chimes of a lost 
empire of man and God come flashing on ethereal volts
<pb id="hols62" n="62"/>
faster than ever lightning flashed. They danced into the
outer space of “the lost Pleiades,” when God thundered
in the heavens and sent it in billions of flaming parts,
broken shafts and splintered spars as flaming messengers
to execute his high behests in the illimitable empire of
space. He looked out on the extended seas of the
ethereal deep, counted the stars, weighed their 
imponderable masses in scales and called them by name. Every
sun is still shining, and every star in the vaulted chambers 
of creation is twinkling in its orbit and dancing and
singing on its eternal lines, making schedule time. Hard
by the throne of God a thousand millions of sparkling
and singing worlds roll on in their awful majesty, and
yet in meek submission to their awful King. On they fly,
wrapping their belted splendors and burning webs of
golden flame around the throne of the great “I Am”—
all but one, and that is the one called <hi rend="italics">earth. </hi>“Oh, earth,
earth, hear thou the word of the Lord.” Who will go in
search of the lost planet called <hi rend="italics">earth?</hi> unite the cables,
tie their broken ends and severed cords and again hitch
them to the throne of God? Who among the ancient
sons of God and the tallest archangels of eternity hath
the arm of power to sound the infinite mains, gather the
cables with hand omnipotent, and relink their broken
fibres? O, ye bright sons of heaven, ye morning stars
that sang together when “all the sons of God shouted for
joy,” can you not go and do wonders and work the works
of gods in the mighty deep? Heaven stood mute, seraphs
dropped their crowns, victors cast their palms, choirs
hushed their voices, the Te Deum of the cycles lost its
melody, and unstrung harps their euphony. Millions of
towering spirits, each wrapt in the splendors of a morning 
sun, with uplifted wings of sheeny brightness, with
eyes of flame whose focal gleam swept the orbits of a
thousand suns, measured the rims of moons and traced
the track of comets, stood in listening attitude but dared
not move. The temple of the tabernacle in heaven was
<pb id="hols63" n="63"/>
opened and the house of the lords of creation ceased the 
eloquent and profound deliberations upon the things 
which “the angels desired to look into.” Bulls and briefs, 
edicts and behests, and all the wide commands of the 
temple court that flamed on lip and tongue, and glowed 
in the hearts of the tall minds and intellectual majesties 
of the universal metropolitan center, felt the tremor and 
the moving forces of the approaching crisis. The crowned
and mitered sentinels who stood on the jasper walls of 
heaven while cycles perished and millenniums died, left 
their golden towers, and like burning splinters of broken 
suns, sweeping from the azure peripheries to the diamond 
centers, they joined the heavenly perturbation and stood 
with bated breath and uncovered heads in the great 
congregation. Fiery squadrons on electric steeds whose 
thrilling circuits quiver with the living energy of heaven, 
faster than flashes of lightnings, thread and ramify the
illimitable “fields of light,” the kingdoms, thrones, 
<sic corr="dominions">dominons,</sic> principalities, powers, heights, depths, lengths 
and breadths, and all the multitudes that dwell in those 
eternal and extended areas under the gem-studded and 
the arch-flaming concavity of heaven's high ceiling are 
summoned to the tabernacle of the great congregation. 
It was “a great multitude which no man could number” 
of all the great personalities and eternal kings and princes 
and queens of the ages that swept along the streets of
gold with sandals of rubies, crowns of diamonds and 
amaranthine robes of sunbeams, whose glorious forms and 
splendid trim glittered like pyramids of incandescent 
flame and glinted blushes of a sun sifting through the 
seven colors of the rainbow. Mighty legates and 
plenipotentiaries in their dazzling ermine and brilliant 
paraphernalia of state, with their broad phylacteries and
embossed folios, containing the legal lore of the eternal 
annals, sat upon thrones of judgment. One hundred-forty 
and four-thousand legations, representatives of as many 
dominions, filled the diplomatic circles with their nodding
<pb id="hols64" n="64"/>
plumes and royal credentials. Far out in the open sea 
towards heaven's impalpable periphery the loyal legions 
of the royal dominions stand with stately mien and awful 
muteness, while a thousand suns peep up from the horizon, 
uniting their blended splendors in graduating zones 
of light as if pinned together by the sheeny tails of comets 
and veiled with the radiance of the morning stars.</p>
          <p>But “there was silence in heaven about the space of 
half an hour.” It was a silence whose mighty influence 
was like the stillness that comes after the haughty steps 
and heavy tramp of cycles and centuries have crushed the
nations, ground their temples to dust, broken the scepters 
of kings, calcinated cast-iron dynasties, corroded 
and gnawed asunder empires of brass and monarchies 
of steel. And still the world feels the iron heel of the 
ages. The despot's spear is not broken, he still maintains 
his throne, riding down the centuries, drinking the 
blood of the nations and wielding the scepter of universal 
dominion. So the profound silence and awful muteness
was deep, distinct, decisive, and heaved the deep bosom 
of heaven as the ocean currents heave the mighty 
bosom of the deep. But a world is lost. A planet, like a 
ship on the high seas that has broken its cable, thunder-struck 
and storm-driven, is tossed upon the ocean of sin 
and the vasty deep of moral pollution. Who is able to 
recover it? Who is able, oh, who? John says, “And I 
saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who 
is worthy to open the book and loose the seals thereof? 
And no man in heaven nor in earth, neither under the 
earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. 
And I wept much because no man was found worthy to 
open and to read the book; neither to look thereon. 
And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not; behold 
the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath 
prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals 
thereof.” Again, “Then said I, lo, I come * * * to do 
thy will, O God.” Again, “Here am I, send me.” This
<pb id="hols65" n="65"/>
is the voice of God the Son to God the Father, loud and
strong, and ringing high above all the mighty powers,
altitudes and massive conclaves and sublime actualities
of the assembled dominions, states and kingdoms of the
universe. Heaven was satisfied. God smiled, musicians
leaped to their harps, seraphs flashed their wings, tuned
their ivory lutes and grasped their golden cymbals and all
the choirs and multitudinous hosts cast down their
crowns, regathered the silver chords of the ancient 
anthems and the eternal melodies of the spheres, waving in
sweet and dulcet octaves the mighty chorus, “Saying with
a loud voice, blessing, and honor, and glory, and power
be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto
the Lamb for ever and ever.” Yea, “for ever and
ever,” and the doxologies rolled and echoed, 
reverberating over “the sea of glass,” resounding along “the
river of life,” until every hill and mountain, valley and
plain, and all the wide arenas, highways and lofty
courts of the skies were filled with the music of his name
and resonant with the redemptive anthem. There is a
chorus in that song for you and for me. A golden harp
for every hand, and deep sweet melodies for every lip,
tongue and heart, and a silver cord and ivory key for
every finger. There is a palm for every victor and a
crown for every conqueror. So he comes, and so he is
here. Behold he standeth at the door, he is at our elbows,
he is in this place.</p>
          <p>Isaac Watts touches the central chord in the universal
diapason when he sings:

          <epigraph>
            <p>“The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from
between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering 
of the people be.”—Gen. 49:10.</p>
          </epigraph>
          <p>The text is a prophecy uttered by the Patriarch Jacob 
upon his dying bed to his sons in the land of Egypt. Passing 
through the troubles of life, he came at last to his 
dying day. The words that he spoke were inspired predictions 
respecting the things that should befall the house of 
Israel in future generations. His prophetic vision being 
touched by the finger of God, and enlarged by his Spirit, 
he sang a song of triumph that he never sang before, and 
threw the verses of its enchanting melodies down through 
the illustrious line of great princes, priests, and kings, until 
the great Messiah became haloed and wrapt in the brilliant 
splendor of his expanding kingdom.</p>
          <p>The Shiloh here spoken of is Jesus Christ, the Son of 
God, and the son of David. He was the son of David 
according to the flesh, and declared to be the Son of God 
with power. Jacob felt that power while the bright rays 
of its light flashed upon his soul and strewed his pathway 
to the grave with the leaves of the tree of life and the blushing 
petals of perennial flowers. Shiloh was his hope. He 
looked through the kingdom of Israel to the kingdom of 
Shiloh, that should come in the fullness of time, and by 
whose power the yoke of sin should be broken from the
necks of the nations, and the mild sceptre of Shiloh should 
sway the life and hearts of men.</p>
          <p>We need not produce any elaborate argument to prove 
that the term Shiloh refers to Christ. From the scope of 
the prophecy, the depth of its subject, and the nature of its
<pb id="hols68" n="68"/>
prediction, especially in its application to a person, Shiloh
can only refer to Christ, the Messiah of God. David and
Solomon were great characters. They were men of God,
and in their official capacity were symbols and metaphorical
representatives of Christ. The kingdom over which they 
presided represented that which was to come. Hence it is 
said, “The Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his 
father David; and he shall reign over the house of Jacob 
forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.” The 
Shiloh then here spoken of is the same as he who should 
“reign over the house of Jacob forever,” to whose “kingdom 
there shall be no end, because unto him shall the 
gathering of the people be.”</p>
          <p>But the text says, “The sceptre shall not depart from 
Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh 
come.” That is, the theocratic government of the Jews 
was to have its kings and rulers coming from the tribe of 
Judah until Christ should come and take the throne whose 
by right it was.</p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="italics">1. Let us consider the Christian system as a progressive 
force.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>Christianity is a growth as well as a principle. While 
its fundamental doctrines are eternal and form the basis of 
eternal government, yet the application of its principles 
and practices is adapted to all conditions of humanity, 
whether collective or individual. It has the same power 
over a single person that it has over a nation of single 
individuals. Indeed, this is the first fruit of its operation. It 
takes hold upon personal life and personal character. It 
seeks the individual members of a nation and the distinct 
characteristics of a people. It often begins with the smallest 
number, and sends them as messengers and forerunners
to open a highway in the wilderness and make a royal pathway 
for our God in the desert. Step after step, it adds one 
by one to its army of heroes and princely warriors. It 
<pb id="hols69" n="69"/>
appeals to each and every one as a distinct consciousness, and 
calls upon the perceptive faculties and reasoning powers 
to consider its claims upon the attention, presenting its 
attractiveness to the sons and daughters of men. It appeals 
to personal interest and human consciousness on the highest 
plane of the eternity of being, and proposes to solve the 
profound and intricate relations that exist between God 
and man. It reaches deep into the moral and spiritual 
entities that relate to the incomprehensible and the incomparable 
Deity. As a moving force, it threads our being, ramifies 
the conscious individuality, speaks in thunder tones to
the sensibilities and all the properties and potentialities of
intelligent creatures. It stimulates, stirs and lifts the 
legitimate aspirations of man to those sunny altitudes, where 
alone God and man walk in peace, and blend in the splendors 
of reconciliation and a glorified union. It moves and 
propels man upward to his designed dignity and the eternal 
harmonies of the universal spheres, where the stars of God 
“forever glow in the fervent warmth of His love.” 
Religion is a secret power. It plies the currents beneath the 
waves of human nature. Men may see you, they may think 
of you, and speak of you, and weigh you in the scale of their 
judgment. They may reach a true or false conclusion 
respecting you as a man and a citizen; but there is a divinity 
that dwells within, whose shape or form they cannot see,
whose stately steps and steady march through the deep 
chambers and hidden receptacles of the soul they cannot 
measure. It is a thing of personal possession and personal 
experience, deep and resonant with the music of heaven 
that fills the soul with the reigning Shiloh, the living Christ 
of God.</p>
          <p>Again, Christianity suits every man, fits every age, and is
adapted to every sphere of being in the universe. It is the 
need of every being, the joy of every soul. It crowns life 
with honor, embellishes its devotees, makes its followers
<pb id="hols70" n="70"/>
conquerors and gives light in the darkest night and opens 
the royal highway to the throne of God. It softens the 
dying bed, bridges the river of death, and in chariots of 
fire takes God's Elijahs to the <sic corr="paradisiacal">paradisaical</sic> city of the 
Great King.</p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="italics">2. “The sceptre shall not depart from Judah till Shiloh
come.”</hi>
          </p>
          <p>That is, Christ was to come and grasp “the sceptre” 
that Judah held. Judah was to hold it until Messiah should 
appear on the scene and take his rightful authority. Christ 
did come. He came at the predicted time, and “in the fullness” 
of the purposes of God. Here he must stay and 
“reign until he hath put all enemies under His feet.” This 
is his earthly work, and his great mission in the world. It 
will not be completed until this is done. “The sceptre”
here spoken of is the royal insignia of the Messiahship. It 
is the emblem, or symbol of His authority, and His right to 
reign over all the earth. Ancient kings and monarchs had 
their sceptres, which signified their complete and extended 
jurisdiction. Before them the millions prostrated the 
body. With trembling heart and hand they bowed to 
earthly masters. But their sceptres have departed, their 
authority has gone, their empires are broken, and their 
kingdoms calcinated by the hot tramp of the centuries and
destroyed by the giant worm of time. Where are they proud
kingdoms of old, that rose, towered, and glowed in their 
might and majesty? Where is the kingdom of David and 
Solomon, that stretched “from the river to the ends of the 
earth?” Where are the great kingdoms of the Babylonians, 
the Medo-Persians, the Macedonians, and the iron empire 
of Rome? Nay, my friends, they have passed away and 
sleep the eternal sleep of death. Their sceptres are broken, 
their crowns fallen, and all their greatness is gone; but the 
sceptre of the Shiloh of God still abides. Why does it 
abide? Because it “is a right sceptre,” a true kingdom of
<pb id="hols71" n="71"/>
righteousness, harmony and peace, and presents to the
judgment and wisdom of men God's idea of government.
It is <sic corr="stronger">stonger</sic> than Bessemer steel, harder than adamant,
more incorroding than the gold of Ophir, and more enduring 
than the precious diamond. It is more enduring than
the schools and systems of thought and philosophy; for
while these perish amid the march of years and the death
of centuries, and fall in the grave of time with their dead
masters and hoary sages, Shiloh's empire still abides, and its
magnetic embodiment in the person of the living Christ,
marches on in stately tread, traversing the breadth of 
centuries, measuring the decades, and wrapping the string of
days and the fibre of hours around his hand, and buckling
the aged cycles and the countless trend of years to his belt.
Columns, arches, mausoleums, pyramids and the 
immortal sarcophagi of famous heroes and dead philosophers
quivered and shivered and tumbled upon their rocky 
foundations at the command of conquering time; but the sceptre
of the “Shiloh” of God still sways in triumph above the
din of war, the clash of elements, and the stroke of years.
Seas shift their beds, rivers change their channels, continents 
grow old with the weight of years and hoary crowns
bestud the islands, while ocean currents grind their rocky
feet to dust and scatter their flinty ribs in the secret chambers 
of the deep. But Shiloh, in the virgin strength of
eternal youth, abides at the head of the marching column
and the triumphant phalanxes, all dressed in white and
panoplied in the robes of truth. But the kingdom of Shiloh
is progressive. It is educative and consequently slow in its
progress. It is slow to the ideas and conceptions of men,
but not slow to God. An educative process must be slow.
The universe is a developing universe. Growth and decay,
expansion and contraction, struggles of life and death, are
universal, perpetual and ceaseless. Nothing essential to this
development stands still or falls to the depth of sound sleep
<pb id="hols72" n="72"/>
or profound quietude. Nothing slumbers through eternal
duration. If death comes, life follows in the wake of years, 
and that which now sleeps will rise again, and at some 
period in the life of God, assert its right to live again. 
Nothing comes but by slow degrees. The oak slumbers in 
the acorn, the tree in the kernel, and the blade of corn in 
the grain. The rose gradually unfolds its petals, and lilies 
blush in the eveningtide. Gentle spring comes after the 
sleep of winter, and the morning succeeds the night. That 
which once was is not now, but it shall be again. “The war 
of elements and the crash of worlds” are constant, general 
and eternal. The glory of systems fades, worlds in
conflagration die, and stars from heaven fall, and catastrophes pile 
their oncoming catastrophes upon the burning decks of
waning suns and dying systems, amid the gush of chaos 
and the death of stars. All is evolution, agitation and 
change. Like the empire of physical nature, there is a 
progressive process in spiritual nature, an agitating 
element, a native force or propulsion that awakes and stirs 
the properties and engages humanity in the eternal struggles.</p>
          <p>Again, it is conflict, labor, and struggle that make a man 
as well as a world. Nothing can be made perfect without 
this necessary struggle and conflict with internal and 
external elements and forces. No conflict is without results 
and products. Every conflict, whether in the realm of 
physical nature or of mind, must have results and products; 
for there is always some end to be attained. A grain 
cast into the “faithful bosom of the earth” struggles to break 
its shell, and by the force of natural selection, or elective 
affinity, throws off its effete properties and gathers and 
assimilates those things that are needed for its perfect 
development. The purpose of the struggle is to make a 
perfect grain of wheat. The oak struggles in the acorn till it 
breaks its prison walls. It then arrays its friends against
<pb id="hols73" n="73"/>
its foes in a struggle for survival, until it is crowned with a
green wreath of leaves and acquires a sturdy trunk of wood.
The waters are purified by their constant ebb and flow,
and the germs of disease are killed in the atmosphere by
the jarring thunders. Society is purified and humanity is
made better by the revolutions and the conflicts of moral
and political forces. Corrupt States and depraved 
municipalities sink beneath the heavy tread and the iron reign of
sin; but the innate spirit of a progressive civilization, 
electrified by religion and virtue, collects its forces, reassembles
its agencies, rises from the dead past, gathers the broken
threads and continues on the highway of progress. Nothing
can be purified and made better without struggle, and no
struggle can be without an end.</p>
          <p>Struggle implies three things—time, progress and 
process; but the end is the perfection of character. 
Everything has all time to be made perfect; and all the time that
is necessary for the process, and the changes and accessions
toward perfection are progress. The perfection of character
is the ultimate end for which time is given, and the process
and progress toward perfection cannot cease until the effort
is coronated with the brightest gems of nature. The kingdom 
of Shiloh cannot stand still, because its very life is in
its thrift and activity. Israel's God neither sleeps nor
slumbers, but watches the forces of the moving spheres,
regulates their order, directs their courses, controls their
elements, and forces recalcitrant members into orderly
lines and harmonious relations. Therefore, every action
in the moral and physical worlds has a meaning that may be
interpreted at some time in the future, and somewhere in
the line of action and of evolution and change. God 
scatters broadly, but gathers again, and the focal center of all
actions is the ultimate will of God, the intricate designs of
the Most High. How, then, can Shiloh's kingdom stand
still? How can its propulsive forces, its Godlike energies
<pb id="hols74" n="74"/>
stand still? Can God sleep, or His Son die? Have the
cables of the universal mechanism been broken, its ship
stranded and the helm of the universe taken from His
hand? Say, ye elements, forces, agencies, natures, and all
ye star-crowned immensities and light-begirt intellectualities 
of heaven, has the King of Saints lost the equilibrium
of the spheres, the balances of heaven, or the end of the
bright curves? Nay; God reigns as of old, and all the 
elements are the witnesses of His power and of His presence.
He touches the octachord of nature with fingers of fire and
hands of power, and at once the thrilling God vibrates the
threads, and every part and ramified relation of the
universal spheres He fills with His tremendous presence,
commands the molecular entities, and the listening sisters
and kindred sires to stop to hear and fly at his 
behests. All things are in His hands. Even the wrath of
man, the rebellion of angels, and all the old sinners of the
ages are to fulfill some great design or lofty culmination in
the executive government of the Most High. Their 
madness and rage, their hardness of heart and obdurate pride,
their lust for place and power, their violent and headlong
assaults upon the high castles of heaven's King, and their
fierce, demon-like onslaught of the truth and the progress
and expansion of Shiloh's empire, are all made to praise the
Lord and magnify His wisdom, justice and truth, while
unwittingly they are carrying forward the golden threads
and silken strands of the Shilohic empire. Fallen devils
and wicked men, the devices of hell and whatever spirit,
being of character that fights against God and His
anointed Shiloh must ultimately fail and sink beneath the
direful wrath of “the Thunderer.” But the kingdom of
Shiloh is to take the place of all others by the process of
hybridization, or that smooth and gentle flow of His love,
presence and power that is exhibited in the nature, character, 
work of the ministry of Jesus Christ. “The Son of
<pb id="hols75" n="75"/>
man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.” His
embassy to earth was not in pomp and splendor, nor kingly
majesty. He did not come heralded by the sound of trumpets, 
the blowing of horns, and the metallic clash of loud 
cymbals and bands of music. No royal robe, nor gem-set 
crown, nor flash of golden sceptre, nor awaiting throne of 
ivory marked His coming. No horses and chariots, nor 
thundering legions of armies, nor tramping hosts of 
soldiery marked His appearing; but “as a root out of a dry 
ground” he broke the stony soil of the hearts of men and 
pushed His way up through the hard and callous surface of
human prejudices, hate and depravity, and the meek and 
lowly Galilean stood forth in the humility of a prophet, 
the garb of a mendicant and the demeanor of a servant. 
There was no visible greatness, nor dictatorial air, nor 
manifestation of earthly power or kingly authority. The silent 
chambers of the woods were His home, the earth was His 
bed, the heavens His covering, and His pillow was a 
stone of the hills. No long-drawn aisles, nor architectural 
shafts of marble, nor Parian slabs, nor polished flint 
adorned the temple of His slumbers, nor flashed upon His
morning vision; but from the rugged hills and silent plains 
the divine Master of the ages and the eldest creations, 
walked into Jerusalem and about Galilee to plant the 
seeds, and in deeper soil to sow those effervescent germs of 
truth and nuggets of power and love that were to permeate 
the nations, cover the hemispheres, ramify the ages, and fill 
the world with the Shiloh empire.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">3. The abstract and concrete empire.</hi> “Unto him shall
the gathering of the people be.” There is something 
wonderful and beautiful in the Shiloh empire. It is wonderful
both in abstract and in concrete. In abstract there is
neither phase nor form nor tangibility of character. It 
cannot be bought, nor sold, nor bartered in the markets of the
world as a commodity in human commerce. It laughs at
<pb id="hols76" n="76"/>
gold, spurns the diamonds of queens and treads the 
embossed gems and pearls of kings and millionaires beneath its
steady move. Real estate, landed lords, the wealth of
dynasties and the gilded splendors of courts and palaces
cannot procure it, nor bring it near. But its spiritual 
dynamos are plenipotent in power, and its strength lay deep in
the bosom and nature of Deity. In the abstract, it is the
government of God, and has His image and superscription.
In every age and phase of civilization it has its magazines of
power, its living energies and undying individualism. It is
separate and distinct from all other kingdoms that seem to
have preceded it, and there are none to follow like it, or
comparable to it. In its character, aim and great ends, it
stands out in bold relief and incomprehensible 
individualism. The agencies employed, the elements and
principles by which it acts and moves upon the feeling 
and judgment of men, are absolutely different from
and high above the conceptions and calculations of
the unaided reason and any discoveries possible for men to
make. To “bring forth the headstones” of its 
expanding empire, with the shoutings of “Grace, grace,
unto it,” is the sole province of divine revelation. No
man can find out God to perfection. He is the ever present,
and yet the ever undiscovered, beyond that degree where
the mind of man may rise and take hold upon the things
of God and know what are those duties and relations that
make for the peace of the intelligent creation. All that
we know of God and the divine administration is mostly 
revealed to the sons of men, either through the elements of
nature, or by His Word. All along through the ages and
the nations of the earth the Lord hath declared His presence, 
His goodness, and His power to the children of men.
He talks to us by day and by night, in the deep resonant
tones of a unique empire of thought and action, whose
vibrating circuits and electrifying majesty are as deep as
<pb id="hols77" n="77"/>
human nature, high as heaven and enduring as the years of
eternity. Everywhere Shiloh's empire touches the deep 
chords of human nature and human hearts, moving, stirring,
revolutionizing and unifying its forces and agencies, 
exhibiting those far-reaching plenitudes of power 
and throbbing energies and plenipotent <sic corr="activities">activites</sic> that 
make up its irresistible character. Every day the 
empire of Shiloh is making its onslaughts and encroachments 
upon the ramparts of sin and hell, gathering 
its forces, collecting its army, disciplining its troops, drilling 
its agencies and coercing the erratic sons and rebellious 
daughters into line, and demanding obedience to the 
sovereign God and His supreme command.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">“Unto Him shall the gathering of the people be.”</hi> All
people shall come to Him, and the congregating millions
shall gather at His feet and crowd to the sacred shrine and
bow before the center of universal power and the majesty
of the universal King. Here comes Shiloh, skipping on the
mountains and dancing on the hills and filling the plains
with the bright halo of His awful presence and the roseate
splendors of His power. His voice is resonant, round and
full, ringing in seraphic tones through the empire of
humanity, calling all his subjects and long-lost children
back to their ancient estate, and back to their ancient God.
Shiloh is coming! Nearer and nearer He approaches. The
thunders of music are rattling through the spheres, and the
lofty tramping legions and the heavy treading white squadrons 
are coming down the line spreading through all lands,
wrapping the hemispheres with the light of God and the
blessing of His presence. He crushes the thrones of kings,
demolishes iron empires, breaks asunder republics, subverts
monarchies, throws down “the powers that be” and slays the
dragon of sin in his ancient isle. Heathen superstitions,
rotten philosophy and godless systems of thought and 
practice fall before His keen, cold steel of “the truth;” and they
<pb id="hols78" n="78"/>
with their ancient gray-haired sires and grandsires and
mitred priests with hoary locks, and all their deluded
devotees, sink beneath his wrath and the power of his 
sovereign rod. Church of God, get ready, stand up; don't be
alarmed! Shiloh is coming, he is coming, coming to reign
until the stars of God pale their light, “till moons wax and
wane no more,” and suns lose their flame and planets die on
their track and scatter to the utmost poles their incinerated
dust. “Hallelujah! 'tis done,” our king is on the throne of
universal empire.</p>

sing.”—Ps. 101:1.</p>
          </epigraph>
          <p>Whoever reads the history of man, weighs his sorrows
and measures his joy, will read the history of songs and
anthems of his days. Indeed, his pilgrimage through
life's thorny mazes is a pilgrimage of song inspired by
the lights and shadows that ever shine and shade his
pathway. Age or nation, clime or condition, cannot take
from him this plaintive or joyous melody that permeates
his individuality, and fills his moments with this 
God-given and heavenly flame. There is in man a golden
harp of a thousand sympathetic chords whose deep and
resonant tones evolve from the golden strings which
vibrate to the music of the spheres and the melodies of
the heart. Whether plodding the lower walks of tears
and sorrow, or on the joyful wing of prosperity, or hearing 
the dull thud of the funeral dirge, the carol of the
sweetest note will stir the soul, revolutionize the heart
and lift the drooping spirit to the altitude of God and the
sunny plains of heaven. Song is an antidote of the 
burdened heart, the laboring soul and the broken spirit.
But the song of redemption is preeminently “the song.”
It is the song of songs. It is the sweetest note on angels'
lips, and the sweetest anthem of the skies. Indeed, the
song of redemption is the thrilling cry that has stirred
the ages, ramified the centuries, filled the decades, 
inspired the prophets, fired the tongues of bards, poets and
seers and cheered the millions with the music of God
and of his Christ. Touched by the omnific finger of
God's love, and set to the dulcet strains of joy, the song
of redemption shall go ringing through the nations, down
<pb id="hols80" n="80"/>
the declivities of time, thread the centers of civilizations, 
cross the howling sea of death, and ring on up to God 
and heaven through countless ages and evolving cycles 
of endless duration.</p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="italics">1. But what is song?</hi>
          </p>
          <p>Song is the music of the soul, the harmonious vibrations 
of the deep chords of the heart and the melodies of 
the spirit life. It involves the elevation of the affections 
and the utterances of the lips by which some theme, 
doctrine, or topic is proclaimed aloud and exultingly in the 
presence of others. In a broader sense, it is the vibration 
of the musical harmonies of the empire of God, 
agitated and active. It is the effort of a kindred spark to
return to its native sun, and be rehabilitated in its native 
clime. It is the divinity in man rising to God its source 
and parent head from whom it came to earth. It is the 
better and higher nature of man springing forward and 
leaping heavenward. It is the soul flying through the 
deep blue ether upon its fiery pinions in search after 
God its “maker who giveth songs in the night.” Song 
implies harmony in sentiment and strain. Strain is the 
vehicle—the chariot wheels of song, but sentiment and 
doctrine are the life and spirit. But song is more. It 
is a spiritual animation, a flame that stimulates, revives
and quickens the moral, mental and spiritual manhood.
It is true, song, like speech, may be greatly improved by 
the processes of culture and practice, and should be 
cultivated by the whole human race; for no system of training 
can be complete without it. Yet there is in man an 
innate attribute of song, an attribute which when 
touched by the hand of sorrow or joy makes the chambers 
of the soul resonant with the symphonies of angels and 
the euphonies of heaven. It is an essential quality of 
his spiritual and religious instinct—a part of his organic 
spiritual constituency. It is organic and God-given. It
is a part of his individual and indestructible selfhood. 
Music is harmonies expressed, song is the vehement act
<pb id="hols81" n="81"/>
of expression. This attribute of song in man has its 
counterpart in creation. Creation is a system of musical 
harmonies combining in a common unity, and that 
common unity is the unit of all units—God. He is the grand 
total of all the totalities in the universe. All the threads 
and lines of days and years, of events, acts, facts, natures, 
beings, agencies, entities, and things, center in his will 
and power, glory and majesty. The millenniums, with 
their creative acts and facts, with their mighty ponderable 
and imponderable realities, are yoked and linked 
together by the indissoluble bands and bonds of his high 
and majestic authority. At his command, angels fly, 
devils fall, comets flash, suns burn, stars twinkle, and 
systems live. Around him, all things dance and fly in 
the inimitable beauties of magnificent harmony, or dash
their splintered shafts and shattered spears at his feet, 
and tremble at his voice. Man is most in harmony with 
the universe and the music of the spheres when the deep 
and dulcet tones of the octachords of the soul are attuned 
and set to the music of God “and of his Christ” by the 
Holy Spirit. The innate principle of song in man is the 
gift of God in a like sense as speech is the gift of God. 
When God made man, he placed within his duplex nature 
certain elements and faculties that compose his 
indestructible selfhood, and that are essential parts of him. 
These elements and faculties were in perfect harmony 
the one with all the others. There was no clashing, nor 
discord, nor want of harmony in the diapason, but the 
octaves of man's being were filled and thrilled through 
and through with the seraphic flame of love and the 
music of God. It is true, some of the faculties of 
his nature were more prominent than others, nevertheless, 
they all were there. They existed, and will exist 
as long as man is man. Place or condition, age or state, 
cannot destroy or annihilate these elements of his being. 
Man is finished in the fact of his being. He is fully man 
in all those powers and principles that imply a finished
<pb id="hols82" n="82"/>
work of God. No new property nor attribute is to be
added in this or any other state, because his being is 
finished in all its parts. It is true, there may be deep and
latent powers of the soul of which we are not conscious,
and which are yet to be developed in a future state; there
may be possibilities of endless progression, development
and expansion that await us in the great beyond. Our
time in this life is too short, and the hemispheres of
earth too narrow, for the excursions and expatriations
of the soul—the vital flame of life. Yet these facts do
not imply that new faculties and elements are to be added
to the manhood of man, but imply progression, thrift,
go and indefinite development. Indeed, man is but 
imperfectly known in the present state. He knows but
little of himself and his fellow pilgrims, because this is
the twilight of his being, the infancy of his life, and the
morning of the primal day of his years. The strongest
are weak and the wisest sons of men are ignorant.
Therefore, the difference is in the extent of his faculties
in expansion, application and development, and not that
new faculties are to be added in another and future state.
The canon was closed in the first act of his creation.
True, there is to be, and must be a change, but only such
a change as implies physical, mental and spiritual 
renovation. This renovation does not take in any new 
constituency, but is a purification and readjustment of that
which was put there in the day of his creation. Yet, it
seems true that those faculties and agencies that are
best fitted for his immediate uses are most developed,
and exhibit a grace and prominence that seem to 
obliterate, or at least to greatly crowd and overshadow the
others, and there is an apparent want of harmony in the
extent of their uses. But this does not prove that any
new principle is necessary to complete his nature.
Speech, knowledge, volition, memory, taste, appetite, and
all the faculties come in the totality of his inherent and
native selfhood. Every constructive element, every
<pb id="hols83" n="83"/>
fiber and line of his nature is necessary for the ultimate 
end and completion of the whole. To extract one of 
these parts or faculties of his nature would unbalance 
the unity of his being and destroy its harmonious 
relations; therefore, man has a whole and completely 
defined status in the fact of his being. But in this nature 
there must be an association of each of its parts with 
each and all of those other parts that compose his being. 
There must be an elective affinity to penetrate and join 
together the several parts, and give grace, beauty and 
symmetry to the finished man. Thus song is the golden 
sunlight that gilds the horizon of the ages with the gladness 
of the day of Christ, making every flower of hope 
bloom, the hills smile, and every lily, rose and violet 
blush in maiden sweetness amid the universal gush of 
joys.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">But song is old.</hi> It is older than our physical earth, 
and was used in heaven before used on earth. Long 
anterior to the heavens and the earth that rose out of 
chaos, it was pressed into the service of the eldest 
children of eternity who tuned their golden lutes in the 
empyrean of the heavens and sang glorious anthems to the 
all powerful and all glorious God. Long before a ray of 
light had pierced the primeval darkness that covered 
earth and sky, when, as yet, the morning star had not 
been hung as a pendant lamp in the orient, nor the 
silvery goddess of the evening had snuffed her candle on 
the occident's setting sun, eternal beings were singing 
the praises of God. Yea, there was song when as yet 
our earth and heavens were held by the iron grip and 
sable bands of king Darkness who had reigned for 
myriads of millenniums, but was finally exiled by the 
Almighty's irrevocable fiat of his power.</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“Ye shades dispel, the Eternal said,</l>

          <pb id="hols84" n="84"/>
          <p>Darkness fled “and nature sprung to light,” while 
mighty and majestic systems rushed on the immortal 
paths of their burning orbits as if blazing around the 
throne of God. Where once all was dark and void, there 
were glory and beauty and the displays of almighty 
power and everlasting joy. Then it was that “The morning 
stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted 
for joy.”</p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="italics">But song is universal and is inherent in nature.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>Creation is God's great harp of countless living strings 
that join the universal harmonies in one grand chorus. 
Creation sings of God, the Creator—the ages sing of his 
eternity, the heavens sing of his glory, the earth of his 
power, and hell of his justice. From the burning lips of 
the lost to the enchanting melodies of blazing seraphs, 
song rises to God without stint or limit from every part 
of creation. All nature sings, especially when its 
golden chords are struck and vibrated by the plenipotent 
finger of God. There is music around us, above us, and 
beneath us. The mighty orchestra with rocking chimes 
sends its thrills through the ages, stirs and stimulates 
the nations with hope, joy and faith. But man must 
die. The doleful song of death lulls the nations to long 
and sound repose, only to be broken by the funeral dirge 
of time, when the stentorian lays of the archangel in 
measured verse and solemn strains shall revivify all 
that have fallen in sleep. Go, take your stand upon some 
high rocky promontory by the raging sea, and listen to 
the great bass drum of God—the winds blowing, the sea 
roaring and spitting froth of its anger into the murky 
clouds above, and agitating its own deep and pebbly bed 
as if stirred by the fiery blasts of hell. The plenipotent 
finger of the omnipotent God strikes the combustible 
elements of the air, and his red lightnings flash along on 
their burning cables, sending their soprano anthems to
hiss and howl and join the bass strains from the sea 
below. High above all the sounds just mentioned are the
<pb id="hols85" n="85"/>
screaking, hissing and crashing of the angry storm, with,
as it were, its mottled, scarred and dusky-faced triumphant 
King rolling upon wheels of torrid amber mixed with
fire and blood, and in his wake lay the shattered greatness
of nature's might and virgin strength. His thundering
chariot rolls in the clouds, while from his burning
brazen car incandescent forked tongues leap out. A
thousand golden cymbals are being simultaneously
struck by the hands of a thousand archangels in heaven's 
aerial sea. The bosom of the clouds are recharged
with electricity—the subtle vitality of nature—and their
sable bands yield and in sunder break, baptizing herb,
sea and land with the blessing of heaven. When the
harsher notes of the storm have flown away upon the
wings of the cloud, then nature, in sweeter and softer
music of praise and joyful lays, is still heard striking
the silver strings of her golden lute, emitting harmonious
melodies which dance through the multiplex octaves of
the spheres. Blow, ye heavenly zephyrs, blow, agitate,
oscillate and vibrate your grand old octachords until
oceanic isles and rock-ribbed hills and smiling plains join
in the mighty chorus and the gush of thrilling joys.
But song is sentiment and doctrine, and has its heroes.
The song of creation has God for its hero, and the song
of redemption has Christ for its hero, the charming 
embodiment of all melodies. In creation the harmonies of
the spheres sing of God, the Hero of its preservation and
the Master of its magnificent parts, forces, properties
and powers. Every part is filled with God and instinct
with music. “The whole earth is crammed with heaven,
and every common bush afire with God.” “The heavens
declare his glory, and the firmament his power.” “All
thy works shall praise thee, O Lord,” says the sweet
singer of Israel. Again, he says, “Praise the Lord from
the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps: Fire, and hail; snow,
and vapors; stormy winds fulfilling his word: Mountains,
and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars; Beasts, and
<pb id="hols86" n="86"/>
all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl; Kings of the 
earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth; 
Both young men, and maidens; old men and children; Let 
them praise the name of the Lord:” Here God is the 
Hero of creation's song, the vital Center in which all of 
creation's melodies, anthems and choruses meet in eternal 
celebration and forever pour their orchestral thunders 
at his feet. Christianity is the ethical system, the 
high moral code of the universe and has Christ for its 
Head, its Song and its Hero. He is the ransoming and 
heroic “prince of peace” of which the ages have sung. 
The song is old and long, but sweet, soft, inspiring and 
thrilling. “Of him who did salvation bring,” the first 
archangels sang. Living coals of heavenly fire dropped 
from the golden censers of angels, and started David's
harp afresh with deeper notes and softer tunes 
descriptive of Messiah and his triumphs. Indeed, the 
Old Testament Scriptures were largely written in verse, 
the whole of which was a part of the mighty anthem of 
redemption. The Christ of the prophets is the Christ 
of the ages. He is the life and subject of all their song 
and the joy of our salvation. He cheered the hearts, 
fired the tongues of bards and poets, and dwelt in sweetest 
strains upon the lips of priest and prophet, prince 
and king, while the rough seers and shepherds in the 
wild and weird desert took up the thrilling cry, and sent 
it back to the walled city, its gleeful notes up to heaven
and its joys on to God. While the ages were pouring 
their verses on the templed hills of God angels heard and 
awaited “the day star from on high.” It is night. 
Shepherds are in the plains watching their flocks. An 
angelic legate from heaven's high arch appears. A halo 
of splendor encircles his dazzling face and his voice, 
wrapt in the soft accents of peace and love, was thrown 
out upon the wing of a heavenly carol. His theme is 
the culmination of the long and hoary decades of waiting. 
And the angel said unto them, “Fear not, for 
<pb id="hols87" n="87"/>
behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall 
be to all people.” . . . “And suddenly there was 
with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts, praising 
God, and saying, ‘Glory to God in the highest, and 
on earth peace, and good will toward men.’” How 
glorious is this song. What impulses does it awaken in the
heart of man! “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth 
peace, and good will toward men.”</p>
          <p>But the text says, “I will sing of mercy and judgment; 
unto thee, O Lord, will I sing.”</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">But what is mercy?</hi> Mercy is a compound of goodness, 
patience and kindness to a lost and sinning race, to whom 
it is extended as a method of escape. God is good to all, 
to men, angels and inferior creatures. But to man his 
goodness is extended until it becomes more than mere 
goodness—it is <hi rend="italics">mercy.</hi> It is melting pity borne away 
from God on the wings of his love and goodness 
to all the sinning race of Adam. It is an invention 
of Deity to reach and rescue that which could not be 
reached and saved by other methods. It presents to the 
world of man the only gateway of redemption from 
punishment and eternal “banishment from the presence of 
the Lord and the Glory of his power.” Mercy has no 
existence except in its exercise, and therefore is not an 
attribute or perfection of Deity. Now, an attribute is 
an essential quality or part of the eternal mind of God 
without which God would not be God. Eternity, 
self-existence, all-power, all-knowledge, immortality, 
foreknowledge, infinite wisdom, etc., are attributes of God, 
because they are essential parts and elements of his 
character. Without these, or any one of them, he 
could not be what he is—the only and eternal 
Jehovah. We can conceive of God without the existence 
of mercy, but we cannot conceive him to be the Eternal 
Mind without those natural perfections that we call 
attributes. Could his power be taken away, he would
<pb id="hols88" n="88"/>
cease to be God. Take away his wisdom, or goodness,
or his eternity, and he ceases to be what he is, what he
always was, and what he always will be—the eternal
Jehovah. But take away his mercy and he is still “the
same yesterday and to-day and forever.” Adam before
the fall was morally pure and perfectly holy, and therefore, 
in that state, was not a subject of divine mercy.
He was not in a state to need mercy, and, therefore, none
was exercised toward him. The same principle applies
to all the tribes of holy angels that maintained their
original state of purity and integrity of character. But
all creatures, whether men or angels, or other intelligences 
of the universe, needed the existence of the attributes 
and were dependent upon them for their own being,
perpetuity and happiness. They needed his mighty
power to perpetuate their days and supply their wants.
They needed his love, his goodness, his wisdom, justice,
omnipotence, and all the attributes, even while they were
in a state of perfect purity and happiness. But in such
a state they did not need any mercy, because that could
only be extended to a fallen and sinning race of beings.
Mere power could create, preserve, or annihilate, but
could not save the sinning race. Justice could condemn
but could not forgive, justify and purify. These were
necessary for the redemption of the fallen race. The
province of justice is to condemn the guilty as well as to
clear the innocent. The province of power is to execute
the dreadful sentence upon the former, and execute and
announce the happy acquittal of the latter. And thus
might we reason concerning all the perfections of Deity.
The attributes of God hold their respective functions
and operate their several and wonderful offices, but none
of them, and all of them could not, and do not save one
guilty sinner. No; the complex government of God
needed a provision of softer terms to reach and save the
sinning and the lost. It needed the invention of Deity,
<pb id="hols89" n="89"/>
and an assemblage and combination of attributes so 
adjusted and balanced as to harmonize with the nature, 
plan and the whole government of God. Man is to be 
saved. How shall it be done? All the attributes of God 
were silent, and profound muteness sat on every tongue. 
All the wheels of divine government stood still amid 
the dying echoes of receding centuries, as if the 
clattering machinery of the universe had unhinged its 
spindles and ungeared its pulleys and stopped every rolling 
belt and whizzing wheel, and had broken every bar and 
bolt that united them together in one harmonious whole. 
But Mercy, like an archangel, wrapped in the seven 
colors of the rainbow, stood before God with pacification
written on her brow. A tablet of solid carbuncle 
fringed with purest gold covered her heart, and in bold 
letters set with diamonds and engraved with the signet 
of love, was written, “Melting Pity.” Around her 
golden-crowned head flashed a halo of heavenly light, as if 
the graces of a thousand queens had gathered about her 
to beautify her glorious self. Her feet were covered 
with amber sandals as if electrified by the affinity of powers 
that continued to move while she stood. Her wings 
of fire were outspread, ready to fly at God's command. 
The thunders of wrath are hushed. Justice half sheathes 
her bloody sword. Angels and all the ranks and files of 
the heavenly world crowd about her to wonder and 
admire. There stood Mercy. Who is she? She is the queen 
of heaven, the gift of God to man, the grandest contrivance 
and the crowning conception of Deity. Slowly, 
but surely, through all the sinful ages of man she has 
gathered up the tears, the woes and sighs of men, and 
carries them to heaven, and to God. The whole earth 
with its crowded intelligences once cried and travailed 
in pain to be delivered and saved. Through all the 
arteries of the human heart and soul, death, eternal death, 
pulsated in every flowing current, played on every string,
<pb id="hols90" n="90"/>
gnawed asunder every silver cable and golden thread
that ramified and cemented the entities and eternity of
man with God. The night of the world was long, dreary
and dark. A heavy leaden cloud in which the slow,
dull mutterings of wrath were heard threw its dark
shade of death and ashy penumbra athwart the space
in which revolved the mental and moral hemisphered
globe. Now and then, a red current of flame would leap
from the darker center and flash across the leaden zones
only to exhibit the stronger and sabler bands that held
in awful solitude the pent-up wrath of the angry storm.
Should God touch one wire, or send a flash of fire through
the whole, like a cloudburst, his wrath would deluge the
moral sphere and sink the sinning race to ruin. But
Mercy stands before the throne of God and waves the
white flag of peace and a truce intervenes. Then stretching 
her golden pinions she views the leaden cloud of
wrath and death, as with steeds of flame and chariots
of fire, she sweeps on and down from the throne of the
great king. But in mid-air she seems to pause for a
moment to survey the continents and islands, to count
the slain millions and the dying thousands, to measure
the depths of sorrows, and the exceeding sinfulness of
sin. Her chariot wheels roll along the defiles of blood
and death, where the prisoner dragged his chain, where
mothers wept for their slain sons and daughters, and
starving children cried for bread because their fathers
and brothers fell in battle. She stands by dying man
and his ruined race. Over his bleeding corpse she
spreads her mantle of grace, recovers him from his sins,
and establishes him in the Eternal, reconciled, sanctified
and saved.</p>

          <head>The Rich and the Poor.</head>
          <epigraph>
            <p>“The rich and the poor meet together: the Lord is the maker of 
them all.”—Prov. 22:2.</p>
          </epigraph>
          <p>In all ages of the world, mankind has been divided 
into two distinct classes, “the rich and the poor.” While 
these distinctions are merely artificial, yet the wisdom 
and intelligence of the masses have always regarded them 
as permanent and enduring. Even the Father of mercies 
has recognized these differences that exist between man 
and man. These distinctions or differences are not 
fundamental, but conditional. They grow out of the state of 
society, and those environments that always accompany 
every age and phase of civilization. So far as science 
and revelation go, there has not been found any remedy 
to equalize wealth, or those belongings and personal 
achievements that have lifted one man above another in 
those things that add to their happiness. But in spite of 
all the precaution, the wisdom, and the foresight of the 
best and wisest of men, the great majority of the human 
race will be poor in this world's goods; it seems a matter 
of impossibility to prevent suffering arising from a state 
of want, and establish any universal rule by which all 
men may become equal in the comfort and common 
distribution of wealth. Hence, there is always room for 
charity, and the exercise of those noble virtues that not 
only help the poor, but also add to the greatness of 
human character and the expansion and development of 
the noblest faculties of human nature. We need not 
now argue the fundamental causes of these differences. 
It is enough for the present purpose to recognize the 
fact of their existence and possible permanence, at least, 
until the triumphs of the gospel system shall change the 
heart of man to that degree where the truth shall force
<pb id="hols92" n="92"/>
his erratic nature to obey its teaching in the fullest sense 
of its letter and spirit. It is convenient to be rich, but 
not sinful to be poor. Nor is it sinful to be rich. Solomon 
says, “Give me neither riches nor poverty,” and he 
further says, “If riches increase, set not thy heart upon 
them.” Both riches and poverty have their advantages, 
the one in this life, the other in the life to come. Here 
it may be said that “the rich and the poor” do not “meet
together,” though the Lord is still “the maker of them 
all.”</p>
          <p>1. <hi rend="italics">The commonness of origin and character.</hi></p>
          <p>The phrase, “the rich and the poor,” refers to our common
origin in the creation and construction of our mental 
and physical character. Man is a genus and not a 
species. All are made alike in all the constituent 
elements of their nature. The basic principles upon which 
character rests are always the same in kind, but different 
in degree, according to the respective conditions under 
which they may have lived. The outward appearance 
and even the varied civil aspects do not affect the mental 
and moral standing, nor the real fundamentals of 
character. All have the same number of faculties, or 
attributes of mind, and the differences we see in mankind 
are not in the fundamentals of their being, but in degrees 
of culture and development. If there were any real 
differences in the nature of humanity as regards the mental
ability, then there must have been different laws of both 
God and man to suit the different capacities. There 
must have been one law for the naturally superior 
and another for the naturally inferior. Otherwise, the 
ends of justice would be defeated, and rewards and 
punishments could not take place on equitable grounds. 
But as there is one God and one moral code by which
all are to be governed, there is a <hi rend="italics">single</hi> and a <hi rend="italics">one</hi> humanity
standing upon one moral foundation and with one 
moral responsibility. There is a difference in mental
accomplishments and achievements, but this is in 
<pb id="hols93" n="93"/>
degrees, and not in kind. One is as much a man as the 
other in the facts of his being, but not in the facts of 
development. Hence, “the rich and the poor meet 
together” in a common humanity. But “they also meet 
together” in the common wants and needs of life. 
Everywhere man is man, and according to the history, 
practices and experiences of the life of man, he is one and 
the same in the substantial realities of his nature. 
Human nature is always the same, no matter in what part 
of the globe man lives. The various forms of his 
civilization, or those improvements that come to him by 
means of his own efforts, are born of the same principles
and the same aspirations, and have always the same end 
in view, namely, the betterment of his earthly state. 
“The rich and the poor” are conceived and are born alike. 
Childhood, youth and growth, manhood, old age and 
death, come alike to all. They have the same tastes, feelings, 
appetite, passions, desires, pains and sorrows, and 
are perfectly the same in their physical and natural 
propensities. In all these things, “the rich and the poor 
meet together.”</p>
          <p>2. <hi rend="italics">But the rich and the poor meet together in a common 
religion.</hi></p>
          <p>They have not only a common fatherhood, and 
consequently a common brotherhood, but they have a unitary 
religion. The great thoughts, the high moral ideas, and 
the lofty conceptions that permeate and pervade the 
spiritual nature of man, had their germs and inception 
in the ancient revelations of God, assisted by sober 
deductions from nature. It is hard to investigate nature
without seeing its Creator, or that energy by which all 
things move and have their being. In some sense, nature 
reflects God. Creation is the material image of the 
immaterial God. The universe is a reflector in which the 
majesty, glory and power of the invisible spirit are 
displayed. Everywhere an active presence is near, filling 
the infinite operations with intelligence and the highest
<pb id="hols94" n="94"/>
ideals of perfections and demonstrations of wisdom.
Everywhere the mind is overwhelmed with wonder and
amazement, until the living manhood is instinct, ramified 
and baptized with the spiritual essence. Creation and 
Revelation tell the same story, and “the invisible things 
of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, 
being understood by the things that are made, even his 
eternal power and Godhead.” The very personality of 
our manhood takes in and assimilates the universal 
“Godhood,” and the life of man is but the product of
another and a higher life, and can but reflect its “image 
and superscription.”</p>
          <p>The ancient revelations of God run parallel with the 
ever-present testimony of creation. So far as they go, 
both are chapters in the eternal economy, and are the 
witnesses and loud proclaimers of an unbroken line of 
control and a unitary system of government. In sentiment 
and doctrine, the corner-stone of religion is always 
the same. As there is but one God and Father, there is 
one government, and consequently, one great religion.
As this one government has been perverted by men, so 
this one religion has been corrupted and perverted by 
the same power. But its great pillars of truths remain. 
Idolatry itself is only a fearful perversion of original 
religion, or ancient Christianity; but as a false coin 
proves the existence of a true coin, so false religion 
proves that there is a true religion. The coin may have
lost its image and superscription, but the solid metal 
remains. Here “the rich and the poor meet together,” 
because on the spiritual plane they are compelled to meet 
in a common religion.</p>
          <p>3. <hi rend="italics">The solemn doom will make them meet.</hi></p>
          <p>But Solomon intended more especially to emphasize 
the solemn doom that awaits all the sons and daughters 
of men—that awful and tremendous catastrophe that 
involves the dissolution of the body, the flight of the 
spirit to another clime, and the silent chamber of the
<pb id="hols95" n="95"/>
grave. What is more serious? What is death? And 
why must I die? There is nothing in the mere physical 
change that we call death, but the issues involved, or 
consequent upon it, are momentous, tremendous, and 
far-reaching in their effects. Death changes the estate 
of man, decides the issues of life's conflict, transports,
exports, and dissolves relations and dispatches the spirit 
as a swift courier to the seat of God, the center of universal 
power. Death involves a mysterious transition 
between the spheres, since it takes us from one place to 
another, or from this to another world. Millions have 
passed over life's boundary line and made the mysterious 
exit, but not one has returned to describe the way or the 
place to which he has gone. No voice comes back to us 
from that far off country, or that unseen realm where 
God and angels dwell.</p>
          <p>No man has, as yet, discovered any remedy or method 
to stay the hand of death, or stop his fearful ravage and 
devastating march through the ages. But step by 
step, and day by day the grim monster encroaches upon 
the children of men in every clime, kindred, and people. 
Triumphantly he reigned from Adam to Moses, and 
claimed those children of men who had not sinned after 
the similitude of Adam's transgression. He marched 
captive an unbroken line across the flood, ravaged the 
postdiluvian ages, swept through the rising generations, 
crushed the empires of the Mediæval dispensations, 
corrupted the streams and broke the trend of modern 
civilization, and ever defies the discoveries of <hi rend="italics">materia medica</hi> 
and the deep ken of modern sciences. All the sons of 
men quail before him, bow at his command, and fall 
beneath his fitful rage and outstretched rod. Solomon
descanted upon the science of life, and the wise men of 
the east fled from him. David sang of him, and the 
prophets of God heard his voice. Job felt his keen cold 
lance. The struggling millions obey his behests, 
grandsires submit to his edicts, queens lay their jewels at his
<pb id="hols96" n="96"/>
feet, kings lay their scepters in his path, and monarchs
pile the ashes of their shattered thrones and the dust of
their empires upon his calcinated highway. He stops
the reign of empire, numbers the days of the mighty,
breaks the oppressing dynasties, strips the beggar of his
rags, the rich of his riches, silences the lyric of the 
enchanter, and hushes the noise of battles and the tocsins
of war. His bow is of steel, his arrows are adamantine
javelins sharper than the fangs of serpents, and more
poisonous than if covered with the blood and filled with
the venom of asps. Always his “sword is bathed in
heaven,” by whose double-edged blade, tears are drawn
and mingled with human blood. His deadly work goes
on always, his havoc is universal, and his reign eternal.
No king is like this king, no reign so long, no dominion
so wide, no lord so cruel, and no ruler of the nations so
exacting. All who owe him must pay in full principal
and interest in the awful crisis. Every cent must be
paid at the time of maturity, every bond liquidated, and
every obligation met. There is no forgiveness nor mercy
nor long suffering. He is deaf to progress and to the
resonant eloquence of song and the golden strains of 
instrumental music. No bars of iron, nor gates of steel,
nor triple-plated armor, nor barricaded palace, though
rock-bound and defended by the frowning artillery of all
the nations, can stay his awful hand. He is the relentless 
enemy of all the living, and plants his waving colors
of eternal sleep over all the dead. He proclaims no 
armistice, nor lifts the white flag of truce. Eloquent 
orators have proclaimed against him; philosophers, sages,
scientists and sanitarian councils have fought against
him with all their main and might; but as steadily as
the flow of time or the roll of the ages, the haughty 
monarch rides in victory, whitens the bones of the nations
in his dreadful wake, and shouts in triumph over the
fallen millions. Onward he ever comes crushing the
diamond centers of human greatness and laughing at the
<pb id="hols97" n="97"/>
wailings and bitter cries of the children of men. O 
death, how dreadful is thy reign! What terrors follow 
in thy path! Here “the rich and the poor meet together.” 
In the cities of the dead they shall dwell together until 
the judgment day. But we are told by the Word of 
inspiration, “the day of the Lord will come as a thief in 
the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with 
a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent 
heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall 
be burned up.” But there is a great center to which all 
things move, and a focal point where all things meet. 
It is the judgment day, the culmination of all days. 
Jesus Christ is the supreme Judge, and God the Father, 
is the eternal Usher. All that move in heaven, earth 
and “the deep track of hell” are hastening to that day. 
Every day with its contents, every age with its thought 
and action, and the centuries with their chapters of blood, 
violence and death, shall crowd to the awful assize, “For 
—evil.” “For God shall bring every work into judgment, 
with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it 
be evil.” Every age has its history, every people its 
records, every man his thoughts and acts. All of these are 
written in the day-book of time and recorded in the ledger 
of eternity. Earthly records may disappear, annalists 
may perish “with their inkhorns dry and their golden 
<hi rend="italics">styli</hi> bereft of their artful touches,” and the dusty leaves 
of their fading folios may be forgotten, or yield to the 
ravage of years; but all things come to the judgment, “the 
day of the Lord.” All the toiling elements, all the groaning 
factors, and all the faculties of mind and matter, are 
the servants of God, and the instruments of his executions. 
His Word must be fulfilled, and the eternal plan 
of government must meet all the requirements of his 
ultimate designs. All the universal propellent and 
repellent agencies, all forces, contingencies, activities 
and powers of the infinite spheres of being are but the 
obedient servants of the Most High to bring all things 
<pb id="hols98" n="98"/>
into judgment at the last day. All the high powers 
of heaven, all the low powers of hell, and all the 
creatures of space and time are traveling to the 
judgment. While they sleep, and while they are awake, 
whether they rest, roll, wabble, or soar, or move on
lightning wings, or dart on electric threads, they move 
on to the great day with irresistible momentum and exact 
precision. There are no broken tendencies, nor severed 
relations, nor shivered bonds, nor lost motion in the 
wondrous whole. Every star, every sun, every shining 
system and brilliant orb, and every broken planet and burnt-out 
world, with their flying fragments of hissing lava, 
with their dying satellites and perishing kings of the 
deep and “the lost sisters of the erstwhile seas,” shall 
terminate the long courses of their mighty rounds, fold 
their wings of flame, stop the flight of their ethereal 
chariots, break their contracting zones, lose their orbits 
and plunge into the universal holocaust in sight of the 
throne of God. Here their forces die, their forms change 
and their equipoise is lost amid “the wreck of matter 
and the crush of worlds.” Here suns set to rise no more, 
moons pale their silver faces, stars leap from their sockets, 
comets take off their sheeny robes, and the trooping 
steeds of “the milky way” roll up to the end of their long 
courses, bow at the throne of God, fall in death and leap 
into the infinite chasm of chaos, and amid the rumbling 
thunders and howling elements, they sink into the 
darkness and death of eternal night. Hence, the Saviour 
says, “Immediately after the tribulation of those days 
shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give 
her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the 
powers of the heavens shall be shaken: And then shall 
appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then 
shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall 
see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with 
power and great glory. And he shall send his angels 
with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather
<pb id="hols99" n="99"/>
together his elect from the four winds, from one end of 
heaven to the other.” But the judgment is coming and 
its approach is to be heralded forth by “a shout” and with 
the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, 
and “we shall all stand before the judgment seat of 
Christ.” The circumstances attending his appearing, 
and the awful signals of his approach are wonderful 
beyond the power of human description, and are worthy of 
the great occasion. Ten thousand thunders rolling and
filling the spheres with awful tremors, and the heavy 
tramp of the martial tread of the judgment millions 
engage the attention of universal humanity. The universal 
summons sends its deep thrilling sensations along all the 
depths and heights of the living and of the dead, and all 
that sleep in their graves shall hear the voice of the Son 
of God. “Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye 
shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all
kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even 
so, Amen.”</p>
          <p>High above the ancient tracks of planets and the burning 
paths of melting worlds and incinerated systems, the 
great white throne of Jesus, the Christ of God, appears. 
Around him bright conclaves and concatinated files of 
the unbroken ranks of the eldest children of eternity 
glitter as if colored by the lightning's flash. Millions of 
angelic golden leagues, like threads of fiery currents and 
tongues of liquid flame, girdle the throne of the eternal 
with the congregated citizenry of heaven. Around him
cherubic legions and the ever deepening trains of 
seraphic files radiate the circles and cover the widespread 
seething seas of living spirits with the scintillations of 
their wings and the beamy splendors of heaven. The 
deep rolling thunders shake the mansions of the dead, 
stir the sleeping millions, and “from the center to the 
utmost poles,” universal humanity, both living and dead, 
breaks the adamantine links of its long slumber and rises
to the judgment bar. No names will be forgotten, nor
<pb id="hols100" n="100"/>
lost sight of, but every dead son of Adam's race shall be 
there. The lost thought and the scattered memory of 
the whole circle of all humanity shall come up with the 
precise characters and individuals to which they belong, 
and every man, woman and child shall still be a real 
conscious self, an eternal moral personality. “All 
things” shall be brought into judgment. Kings shall 
bring their crowns, monarchs the histories of their 
reigns, conquerors their bloody swords, and annalists 
the records of their people. All the works of the human 
race, both public and private, shall be brought into 
judgment and weighed in the balances of truth and equity, 
and judged by the justice of God and the inexorable 
law of righteousness. Oh wondrous day! It is the day 
of days, the culmination of all days, the center where all
things meet, the place and date of all final decisions, and 
the destiny of all men.</p>

          <head>The Perpetuity of the Name of Christ.</head>
          <epigraph>
            <p>“I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore 
shall the people praise thee forever and ever.”—Ps. 45:17.</p>
          </epigraph>
          <p>Originally, this Psalm has reference to king Solomon, 
the great son of great David, because the kingdom of 
Solomon, as well as Solomon himself, represented the 
spiritual and physical empire of Messiah. Solomon in 
his glory was a fit anticipation and prefiguration of the 
Christian system in its progressive development and 
universal sway. Though Solomon was great, yet a
greater than Solomon is here spoken of. The name to be
perpetuated through all the coming ages is not the name 
of Solomon, but the great name of Jesus Christ. As the 
sun, with its piercing and brilliant rays gilds the horizon 
with its bright light, and fills the world with his golden 
splendors, so Messiah has arisen upon the dark sphere 
of human depravity. Though slowly and gradually, yet 
steadily he will climb the ecliptic of the world's civilizations 
until a halo of saving grace shall electrify, purify 
and save the millions from sin and ruin.</p>
          <p>It is said of Christ that “on his head were many 
crowns” and “that he had a name written that no man 
knew but himself. And he was clothed with a vesture 
dipped in blood; and his name is called the word of God.” 
So he is distinguished by sublime titles, indicative of his 
nature, work, and character. Like the stars of heaven, 
they beset and bestud the oracles of truth, and will
forever shine and glitter through all the ages of the nations 
until every tribe of man shall be bedecked with the gems 
of truth, and every lip and tongue shall glow with his 
praise. How wonderful is his name! In Genesis he is 
said to be “the seed of the woman.” He is called also
<pb id="hols102" n="102"/>
“Shiloh.” In Job he is called the Redeemer. In Isaiah 
he is called the “child born,” “son given,” “and his name 
shall be called, Wonderful Counsellor, The mighty God, 
The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. (Is. 9:6.) 
In Zechariah he is “The Branch,” for, says the prophet, 
“Behold the man whose name is the Branch; and he shall 
grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple 
of the Lord: Even he shall build the temple of the Lord;
and he shall bear the glory and shall sit and rule upon 
his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne, 
and the counsel of peace shall be between them 
both.” (Zech. 6:12, 13.) In the prophecies of Haggai 
he is called “the Captain of our salvation.” In Daniel 
he is called “the most Holy.” (9:24.) In Jeremiah 
he is called “the Lord our Righteousness.” In Hosea he 
is called “David their king.” In Matthew he is called 
“Christ.” In Luke he is called “the Day Spring from on 
High.” In John he is called “the Lamb of God.” In 
Acts he is called “Lord of all,” and “Prince of life.” In 
Hebrews he is called “the Captain of our salvation.” In 
Romans “the Deliverer.” He is called “the Alpha and 
Omega,” “the beginning of the creation of God,” “the 
faithful witness,” “the root and offspring of David,” and 
“the lion of the tribe of Judah.” But the especial and 
preeminent name of the Redeemer, is <hi rend="italics">Jesus,</hi> and in 
connection with this, is “Christ,” the anointed of God. He 
is appointed of God to fill a great office. He is a Priest 
to offer up sacrifices for us—for all the sinning nations 
of the ages. He is a King, for, says the prophet, “Behold 
a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall 
rule in judgment.” He is the Prophet of God to man, to 
teach him the deep things of God and the mystery of 
salvation.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">I. His name is great because it is significant of a great
character.</hi> “What think ye of Christ?” Who is he? and 
whence did he come? For what did he come? His
<pb id="hols103" n="103"/>
word records the work of human redemption. He came 
to seek and save that which was lost. He came as the 
God-sent, the heavenly Legate, with the instrument of 
peace written by the finger of the King of heaven. He 
came to bind up the broken-hearted, and to cheer the 
millions with the music of God and the message of love. 
He gave sight to the two blind men at Capernaum by 
the word of his power, and at the same place the dumb 
demoniac was healed. At Gadara he made the deaf and
dumb man hear the sweet accents of love and speak the 
praise of the Most High in Decapolis. At Nain he gave 
life to the widow's son and joy to a mother's heart. At 
Samaria ten lepers were cleansed of the most loathsome 
of all diseases. At Gadara the legion of devils 
fled at his command and plunged headlong into the sea. 
The raging storm upon the sea of Galilee heard his
invincible fiat, and the waters ceased to dance to the music 
of the winds. At Jericho blind Bartimeus saw the 
bright light of heaven for the first time by the healing 
power of Messiah. At Bethesda five thousand were fed 
by the incarnate Son of God. He raised Lazarus from 
the grave, expelled the palsy, scattered fevers, dried up 
issues of blood, and restored the withered hand. But 
his name is to be perpetuated because of the doctrines 
he taught, “for he taught them as one having authority, 
and not as the Scribes and Pharisees.” It is said that 
“he spake as never man spake,” but no man knew the 
truth as he knew it. He taught <hi rend="italics">the truth</hi>—preeminently 
<hi rend="italics">the truth</hi> of God. His doctrines dropped “as the rain,”
and his “speech” distilled “as the dew, as the small rain 
upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass, 
because he published the name of the Lord; ascribe ye 
greatness unto our God.” What would we do without 
the words of Christ? To what school of science and law 
should we go to learn what we have learned from the 
blessed words of Jesus? Can human wisdom find
<pb id="hols104" n="104"/>
out God to perfection? The world without a Christ! 
How dark and desolate! “Thou hast the words of eternal 
life, unto whom shall we go?” Nay, the world 
belongs to Jesus Christ. It is his by redemption: “Ye are 
bought with a price,” and that price was the blood and 
tears and sorrows of the Son of God; “being rich, he 
became poor, that through his poverty ye might be made 
rich.” He is at work to-day for you and for me—for 
every child of man. His doctrine is being distilled as 
the dew upon the delicate violet, the fragrant lily, the 
blushing rose, the lofty pine, and towering cedar. His 
sweet words of truth and love still play on the harp of 
life, and ring out and spread over the world, crossing 
seas, oceans, islands, piercing continents, sweeping 
through the gates of kingdoms, and the melodies of his 
name are chanted in palace halls and ivory temples. On 
his name flies as if winged with the zephyrs of Ceylon's 
isle, laden with the breath of flowers and the melodies 
of the spheres. The name which angels adore and 
worship, the name so full of consolation to the sinning and 
lost race of Adam is Jesus, the Christ of God.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">“I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations,</hi> 
because all great events are connected with it.” “The 
Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before 
his works of old. I was set up from everlasting, from 
the beginning, or ever the earth was. When there were 
no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no 
fountains abounding with water . . . . . When he prepared 
the heavens, I was there; when he set a compass upon the 
face of the depth: when he established the clouds 
above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep: 
when he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters 
should not pass his commandment: when he appointed
the foundations of the earth: then I was by him, as one
brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing 
always before him; rejoicing in the habitable part
<pb id="hols105" n="105"/>
of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.”
(Prov. 8.) The Apostle, in Hebrews says, “By whom also 
he made the worlds.” Thus he is identified with the 
creation of the world. In Revelation he is styled, “The 
beginning of the creation of God,” and “the first born of 
every creature.” He is the Lamb slain from the 
foundation of the world. He was with God the Father when 
he said, “Let us make man in our own image.” He is the
Angel of the covenant which appeared to Moses in the 
burning bush in the wilderness, and said, “I am that I 
am.” He it was who smote the first born of Egypt's 
rebellious sons and overwhelmed her haughty king and 
his hosts in the Red Sea, He was the rock smitten in 
the wilderness which gave the sons of Israel drink; for
says the Apostle, “That rock was Christ.” He was the 
fourth one that looked like the Son of God in the fiery 
furnace with three Hebrew children, and by his power 
he quenched the violence of the fire, so that they came 
out without the smell of fire upon their garments.</p>
          <p>As the Great Redeemer, he “cometh from Edom, with 
dyed garments from Bozrah.” He “is glorious in his 
apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength” and
hath trodden in the winefat alone. As the Redeemer,
he came to establish his church by organizing its
spiritual forces, uniting its energies and inspiring the
millions with hope, causing them to call him blessed.
Onward he drives his chariot wheels. They are thundering 
and rumbling along every commercial channel, darting 
into every little trading cave, and rolling through
the streets of the great cities, while rural plains and
flowery dells rejoice at the sound of his coming. He is
the Hope of the world, the Light of the nations. He is
moving and stirring the public heart and changing 
sentiment and thought. Ancient superstitions and modern
infidelity are trembling at his approach, while the 
evolutions of society are moving upward to the mount of a
<pb id="hols106" n="106"/>
purer faith and a higher standard of morality. The lightning 
carries his word, and winds transport his name
across the seas, and ocean cables quiver with his truth
and dance with his praise. But the remembrance of his
name cannot be blotted out. It cannot be lost or forgotten 
among the vast assemblage of great names. He
stands not as a star in the zenith that bestuds the “Milky
Way,” but as a great shining sun superlatively luminous
and alone flying along in his own glorious orbit, and
with an undimmed lustre he shall shine on through 
endless days. But few names have outlived the centuries
and none have been so universal as Christ's. Many
whose names have been remembered by posterity have
been remembered because of their wickedness, 
monstrous crimes and diabolical acts, as Nero, Antiochus,
Domitian and Herod. Others have their names kept
alive because of military prowess and warlike achievements, 
as Cæsar, Hannibal, Alexander and Napoleon.
Some are remembered on account of discoveries in
science and art, or because of their philosophical and
literary productions; others on account of their 
virtues and philanthropy. The nations extol their 
heroes and praise their greatness in verse, song, and
national airs. They celebrate their birth and death,
and perpetuate their memories in shafts of marble, 
pillars of stone and monuments of bronze. The mother
endeavors to perpetuate the memory of her darling child
by wreathing its grave with garlands of flowers and
softening of the sod by showers of tears. The children of
dead fathers carve in solid marble, enduring epitaphs
of love and esteem. But verse and national air shall
cease amid the clash of nations and the wreck of kingdoms. 
Shafts of marble, pillars of stone and monuments
of bronze shall tumble and crumble and perish under the
heavy tramp of the ages. The graves of parent and child
though wreathed in flowers and wet with tears, shall be
<pb id="hols107" n="107"/>
forgotten, yet the name of Christ shall be remembered 
in all generations. It shall be remembered because of 
his personal purity, his gracious words, his wonderful 
miracles, his unbounded love, his sufferings and 
vicarious passion and death, his glorious triumph over men, 
devils, earth and hell. He will be remembered as the 
Founder of Christianity, the universal Saviour, and the 
ever reigning King. <hi rend="italics">His name cannot be blotted out by any 
earthly power.</hi> Earth and hell have conspired against
his name. Kings and rulers have covenanted against 
him. Learning, philosophy, power, wealth, influence and 
the arms of nations have all been employed against him, 
but all in vain.</p>
          <p>But says the text: <hi rend="italics">“Therefore shall the people praise thee
forever and ever.”</hi></p>
          <p>Some men have said in effect the time will come when
the name of Christ shall be forgotten! This cannot be.
God has said, “His name shall endure forever.” Again
he says, “Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever, a sceptre 
of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom, therefore 
God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil
of gladness above thy fellows.” How can his name be
forgotten, when “the people shall praise him forever and
ever?” Can the sun be forgotten while he pours his
burning rays on the earth? Indeed, his name is the 
sympathetic chord in the octachord of the ages and nations.
His praise vibrates all the fibres of the heart, plays on
every string, flashes on every nerve, quivers on every
golden thread and fills every chamber of the soul with
his love. He has been praised by prophets, lawgivers,
priests and kings, by shepherds, seers and bards. From
the temple hill of God, his praise rang out from the hosts
of Israel, and thrilled Judah with the music of his name.
Solomon calls him “the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the
valley.” David said of him, “Thou art fairer than the
children of men; grace is poured into thy lips; therefore
<pb id="hols108" n="108"/>
hath God blessed thee forever.” <hi rend="italics">The celebration of his
name began of old.</hi> Each generation will continue to
praise his name. The fathers will die with his praise
upon their tongues, but his praise will not cease. Where
the fathers may leave off, their sons and daughters will
come forth with youth's enlivening fire and chant his
blessed name to the next generation; and then that 
generation will swell the high sounding chorus until at the
base of the imperial throne of the judgment day, all the
choruses of the ages, though old and gray with the
weight of centuries, will fall upon the ear of an assembled 
universe. Nay, more, they shall go ringing on
through the cycles over the mountains of God, and over
the hills and wide extended plains of heaven, until again
all the morning stars shall sing together, and all the
sons of God shall shout for joy. Where will the 
celebration of his name stop? Who can set bounds to it?
“Sirs, if these hold their peace, the very stones would
cry out.” Sweet carols would spring from the earth,
and songs of praises from the rocks of the hills. The
rivers would murmur it, the rills would dance it, the
seas would hum it, the storm would howl it, and the
winds would whistle among the trees of the wood, until
leaf, bud, flower, and trunk would quiver with the melodies 
of his name and the joys of his salvation. Before
his name should cease to be praised by “the people,”
Jehovah, his Father, would evoke all the powers of the
universe, because he hath declared that “the people shall
praise thee forever and ever.” Yea, he would raise to
life every dead prophet and sleeping saint, gather the
broken strings of every harp, reassemble every choir,
call up from the dead past every lost song, and revive
afresh all the melodies of the centuries and the anthems
of the ages. He would touch all the golden strings of
nature's great harp and fill them with the music of his
name and the praises of his great Son. <hi rend="italics">Think what it
would require to erase his name.</hi> Every Bible must be
<pb id="hols109" n="109"/>
burned. Every book, page, and tract that contains his 
name must be destroyed. Every church must be torn 
down. The tongue of every Christian must be hushed 
in death. Every Sunday-school must be banished and its 
songs annihilated. All the harps of heaven must be 
broken and all the angels destroyed. All the saints in heaven 
must be silenced in eternal muteness and the heavenly
tabernacle of the most high left without a note of praise. 
David and Asoph, the sweet singers in Israel, must be 
brought up from their long repose, their hymns and 
songs gathered and burnt to ashes. What will you do 
with Milton and Watts, Toplady and Charles Wesley? 
Their songs will outlast the ages, and are to-day ringing 
around the globe, warming the hearts of believers, 
inspiring the laboring sons of God, and filling the world 
with joy and gladness. What will you do with the <hi rend="italics">Te 
Deums</hi> of the ages and the melodies of the spheres? 
Before the name of Christ can cease to be praised, seraphs 
must lose their joys, angels their songs, and all the 
symphonies of the redeemed in heaven and on earth must be 
struck dumb with silence of the grave. Bards and prophets, 
philosophers and sages, must all be annihilated, and
their names and songs and melodies wiped off the face 
of creation and erased from the annals of the ages. But 
man is a harp of a thousand strings. In his redeemed 
state this harp, with all its strings and scales, vibrates 
the name of Jesus Christ. His name fills all the 
sympathetic chords in the octaves of his soul and in the 
octachord of the nations and ages. We are taught in the
Scriptures, that if men are repressed from praising the 
name of the great Redeemer, the stones would cry out. 
The idea is, Christ's name must be praised, for the word 
and promises of God must be fulfilled, and therefore, 
before his word is allowed to fail, he will make the stones 
praise the name of his great Son. Yea, my friends, 
before the promises of God can fail, he would give every 
rock a harp, every tree a song, every flower a melody,
<pb id="hols110" n="110"/>
every hill a verse, every breath of ether a symphony, 
every sunbeam a carol, and every streamlet, river, sea, 
bay and gulf an anthem. He would fill heaven and earth 
with hymns whose choruses would praise the name of 
Jesus Christ. Stirred by the breath of God, the saints 
would arise from the dead, take up afresh the name of 
Jesus and thunder it through the vaulted mansions of the 
skies. The stars would hand it down, the moon would 
kiss it, and the sun would shine it through all the planets,
while ethereal currents would waft it away, until 
“Arcturus, Orion, Pleiades and the Chambers of the South” 
would start all the celestial inhabitants of the “Milky 
Way” to the celebration in sublimest strains of the name 
of Jesus Christ.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">But his name is to be remembered in all generations, in 
the sense of including all the nations of the earth.</hi> His name 
is to be as widespread as the human race itself. The 
millions of earth's inhabitants are to join in the universal 
jubilee and know the universal salvation. The wheels 
of commerce are to roll it along their iron highways. The 
steel-clad <sic corr="&quot;greyhounds&quot;">“grayhounds”</sic> of the seas, dancing on the 
foam-crested paths of interoceanic traffic, must bear his name 
to millions who have not yet learned all the verses of the 
mighty chorus. Cables that sleep on the pebbly bottom 
of the deep must hum the syllables of his name to China, 
Japan, Africa, Australasia, to the “Latin States” and the 
great islands of the seas. Telegraphy and Telepathy are 
his winged messengers that stand ready to do his 
biddings. These fly and dart at his command and quiver 
with the celebration of his name. Shall the praises of 
his name stop here? Nay, my friends, in heaven it shall 
be continued, while the millenniums shall roll on their
eternal cycles. Moons may wane, suns change, stars 
perish, and the centuries burdened with the weight of 
events, may die, but his precious name will still be the 
theme of angels and all the redeemed children of God.</p>

          <head>From Repentance to Final Restitution.</head>
          <epigraph>
            <p>“Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be 
blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the 
presence of the Lord; and He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was 
preached unto you: whom the heaven must receive until the times 
of restitution of all things.”—Acts 3:19-21.</p>
          </epigraph>
          <p>The text is designed to cover all those periods and
dispensations of time through which and over which the 
Gospel kingdom should extend, and to cover those ages and 
arenas that compose its fields and areas of activity. In its 
organized capacity and character, the heavenly kingdom 
has its external and visible coalition of forces and its 
confederation of progressive and active entities and elements, 
as any other kingdom. Consecrated manhood with its 
wisdom, experience and achievements, makes up a great 
part of those factors that must always be an essential part 
of the visible body of the church of Christ. In one sense 
the church is a kingdom of men, since men must constitute 
its subject and present that plan of operation in which the 
splendid rule and power of the living Christ is manifest. 
But this part of the heavenly kingdom in which man 
is the active subject is but a part of the invisible and 
far-extended empire that covers the deep steps of the 
Infinite and that lives and acts upon the broader planes and 
the boundless spheres of being. On earth we only see and 
comprehend a diminutive phase of the power and majesty 
of that glory that lies in the beyond. It is only in the 
ages to come and in those wonderful transitions of power; 
goodness and grace that the whole kingdom of the Most 
High can be revealed. As creation rose by the touches and
<pb id="hols112" n="112"/>
successive wonders of the hand of God, so His spiritual 
and visible empire must rise until the evolutions and relays 
of His hand “make all things new.” As creation had its 
incipiency—its first step and its first day—so the expanding 
“kingdom of heaven” has its beginning in the bosom of the 
children of men. Rising from the darkness of the past, like 
the first morning star of the oldest creation, it began its 
upward climb upon the ecliptic of the world's humanity in the 
shadows and mists of mental night. Though apparently 
slow, yet upward amid the din and roar, the hiss and clash 
of displaced elements of reigning sin and triumphant hell, 
the Son of God piles stone upon stone, arch upon arch, until 
golden turret and flaming spire gild the universal horizon 
with light and truth, and the majesty of His love. As all 
the stones in a building are cut, polished and fitted, so every 
one who becomes a member in this heavenly kingdom, 
must be changed by the operations of His grace, love and 
power, and made to fit his place in the heavenly temple. 
There must be a perfect harmony of parts with parts, and a 
perfect harmony of relations. There must be a homogenizing 
of heterogeneous parts, principles, natures and agencies 
with divine equanimity and the invisible fullness of 
Deity. There must be that plenitude of power and 
cohesiveness of elements to solidify all parts and immortalize 
the whole. This kingdom must be God-made and
God-given. It must be like God.</p>
          <p>But the text says: “Repent ye, therefore, and be 
converted.”</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">1. Repentance and conversion.</hi> In what do they 
consist? And why are they necessary? In the very nature 
of the laws of God, and in the very nature of man, 
repentance is absolutely and indispensably requisite. The 
illustrations in the above show the reasons why there must 
be a change in human nature before entering the kingdom
<pb id="hols113" n="113"/>
of God. Not only do the Scriptures declare, but 
history, fact and experience declare, man to be a sinner, a
woeful sinner, and therefore needs repentance and conversion 
that there may be a peace-offering and reconciliation
between him and his God. Nothing can be done for human
redemption and the peace and happiness of mankind unless
there is some way, means, or plan by which man and
God call be brought on terms of reconciliation. We are
taught in the holy Scriptures, that “sin is the transgression 
of the law,” the violation of God's command, and the
natural consequence is the punishment of death, “for the
soul that sinneth shall die.” And this applies to all the
intelligences of the universal empire of God, whether they
be men or angels or any other rational creatures. If angels
sin, they are cast down to hell and overwhelmed by the
burning floods of death and darkness to await the judgment
day of Almighty God. If man sins, then he also must 
be punished, because for every transgression and 
disobedience there must be a penalty attached, and as surely 
as there is a law to be obeyed or violated, there is of 
necessity, a penalty, a sure penalty, that will fall where 
it belongs, unless through mercy there is made a way 
for forgiveness. Mercy, therefore, is the gateway of 
man's escape from death or that punishment due his
sins. Now, mercy is not an attribute of Deity. It is 
not a single inherent quality or part of God, but it is 
rather a combination or mingling of some of the attributes 
of Deity. It is an invention of God, to reach and save the 
lost. Wisdom, power, love, goodness and pity united 
and formed the splendid scheme of redemption, and selected 
the Son of God as the living embodiment of the divine 
combination. Hence, mercy is a harmonious combination 
of deistical elements so attuned and balanced 
that the universal diapason plays in unison in the government
<pb id="hols114" n="114"/>
of God without friction. Every wheel and cord, 
every band and cog, with all the listening elements and 
obedient forces conspired to reach the ends of government, 
save the sinner, and “justify the way of God to man.” 
Therefore, the plan of salvation, is a plan of <hi rend="italics">mercy,</hi> the 
best of schemes, the crowning work of God, and the divine 
ultimatum in the skill of government and the loftiest and 
the sublimest executive wisdom. Power was infinite and 
stood ready to create worlds or to execute the vengeance of
God and spread his wrath upon the heads of the rebel 
compact, but power could not save the sinner. Love, the sweetest, 
the softest, the superlative attribute of God had no 
power to save the sinner. It had the will, the wish and 
desire, but had no means to reach the sinking culprit. The 
will of God was chained by the dictates of Justice who 
clamored for the death of the sinner. Omniscience, on his 
speedy wing of flame, swept the spheres, sounded the depths 
of space, weighed the elements in the balances of judgment, 
but could not reach the sinner. The Eternity of God, robed 
in the belted splendors of the cycles, with the dead centuries 
and the broken wheels and severed cables of the decades 
piled at his feet, spoke and said, “Nay.” But Love called 
a council of all the Attributes of God, and Wisdom 
said, “Let us form Mercy,” and at once all the splendid 
qualities, faculties and harmonies of Deity glittered around 
the shining center of Love and Goodness, and gave birth to 
<hi rend="italics">divine Mercy,</hi> and then crowned her the Darling of God, 
the Queen of heaven and the conquering Mistress of the 
centuries. “Repent ye, therefore, and be converted,” that 
you may obtain this mercy, that is, be sorry for your sins, 
forsake them, “and do work of righteousness.”</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">2. But what is conversion?</hi> It is regeneration. The 
making of a new creature in Christ Jesus. It is a reformation 
or a work done in us by the Holy Spirit. It is the 
<pb id="hols115" n="115"/>
impartation of the divine nature to that of the human, and is
instantaneous. Man repents, but God regenerates. The 
work of regeneration or conversion is, therefore, divine and 
superhuman. No man can regenerate, or recreate, or pardon 
sin. This is the work of God alone. Every pardoned soul 
must be conscious of it, he must know what the Lord hath 
done for him, otherwise he would be devoid of that knowledge 
that is essential to his keeping the law of God and living 
obedient to his commandments. This is the groundwork 
of salvation, the beginning of the kingdom of God in 
the hearts and lives of men. It is the essential badge and seal 
by which we enter the kingdom of God, both in earth and 
heaven. Sin expatriated man from the family of God, 
regeneration matriculates him, and brings him into 
naturalization with the government of God and the family of
heaven. Hence, the Saviour says, “Ye must be born again,” 
that is, “born” from above, so as to reflect the perfect image 
of the invisible God. “If any man be in Christ Jesus, he 
is a new creature,” or a new creation.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">3. Each regenerated soul is an image of God.</hi> This is 
“the restitution of all things” mentioned in the text. 
The declarations of God must be fulfilled. His word 
cannot return unto him void, but it must accomplish 
that whereunto he hath sent it. Every knee 
shall bow, and every tongue shall confess. Now, “the 
restitution of all things” is a process. It is the 
outgoing of the divine power, the manifestations of the 
truth of God in human life and in the ages of humanity. 
The ultimate design of the gospel system is the radical 
reconstruction of human nature, and consequently the 
predominant reign of the truth by organized Christianity. 
The things to be restored are the things lost. Christ came 
to save the world, to regain the long lost ones, and to
reestablish God's ancient authority over the children of men.</p>
          <pb id="hols116" n="116"/>
          <p>“The restitution of all things” is to put man back in 
favor with God and in harmony with the laws of God, both 
in his spiritual relation and in his personal and physical 
conditions. God “made him a little lower than the angels,” 
“crowned him with glory and honor,” placed his image 
upon him, and made him lord of creation. In the ascending 
chain of creation man stood next to angels. The first links 
in the chain of creation were the formless and insensitive 
elements that slumbered in crudest shapes and deadest chaos. 
Darkest forms swept the bosom of the deep. Black squadrons 
of burning clouds and howling thunders hissed and 
roared and sported in gyrated rills, and rose in splintered 
shafts and broken spars and threw billions of their liquid 
tongues across the highest empyrean and died in writhing 
agonies hard by the throne of God. The eternal seas, impregnated 
with ancient night and unpenetrated by angelic wing, 
or thought, covered all the unmeasured spaces and 
distances from naught to God. The oldest eternity left the 
oldest creation without a zone or a hemisphere, and played 
about its own shifting centers, unconscious of order, and 
unconscious of its God. No sun shone, no star twinkled, 
no comet with fiery tail and burning disc flashed across 
the mighty deep, nor cut the ambient rims of darkness by 
its majestic sweep or godlike steps through the fields of 
night.</p>
          <p>But the second link of creation's chain began. God 
touches the elements with omnific finger. Material for 
the second link is laid upon the anvil of almighty power. 
The trip-hammer of wisdom plays on the burning material 
while ten thousand worlds, and ten thousand more, fly out 
into space, seek the golden threads of their orbital rounds, 
and like battalions of blazing seraphs, crowned and robed 
in the splendors of omnipotence and the power of the eternal, 
they dance on in space to the command of God, the
<pb id="hols117" n="117"/>
song of the cycles, the chime of the ages, and the music 
of the spheres. The oldest children of eternity, the tall 
archangels, and the heavenly princes and “morning stars 
that sang together,” stepped out from their places in the 
lofty house of God, and with golden cymbals and 
high-keyed organs all the thundering orchestra of heaven 
touched the deepest chords and dug from the spheres 
the sweetest melodies and the ascending scales of the 
euphonious vibrations of all the ages known to immortal
spirits and immortal singers.</p>
          <p>Thus the second link of creation rose from the sparkling
anvil of God to the crowned melodies of heaven and the
jubilees of angels.</p>
          <p>The third link in creation was man. Creation rose from 
the insensitive to the sensitive—from the non-thinking 
elements to the conscious, thinking man. He was made “in 
the image of God.” He was made like God in the faculties 
of his moral and spiritual nature. Like God, he was 
endowed with a mental constitution that should always 
reflect the image and nature of his Creator. And this part of 
his being is its most essential characteristic, and is the real 
fundamental elements of his individual character. We
cannot conceive the idea of some, that man is like God in 
his physical personality. God is not flesh and blood and 
bones and sinews, like the children of men. He has neither 
body nor parts after a physical sense. “God is a spirit, and 
they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and 
in truth.” He is the incomprehensible Deity in his 
substance or in the mode of his existence, as well as in the 
grandeur of his power and sublime perfection of his being. 
How, then, is “man made in his image?” Evidently, “man 
is made in the image of” his Creator in the mental and 
spiritual faculties of his being. As God is a spirit, man is 
a spirit, and as He is a mental character, so man is a mental
<pb id="hols118" n="118"/>
character. As God cannot cease to be, neither can man 
cease to be. As God will live forever, so will man; for he 
is eternal in the fact of his being. He is an entity, and 
never can be a non-entity. He is an existence that cannot 
become a non-existence. His conscious humanity is 
incapable of decay, and incapable of annihilation. “The 
heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the 
elements shall melt with fervent heat,” but “the new heavens 
and the new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness” shall 
find the mental humanity of man unharmed and indestructible. 
Age upon age, cycle upon cycle, century upon century, 
may flow on in their streams through the shoreless 
ocean of eternity; but man will live on in his 
conscious existence, and rise above all the changing scenes
and diversified elements, conditions and powers that may 
come upon the plane of being in the spheres of the
universe. Man may be lost in hell, or saved in heaven, but 
in neither place can he die the death of annihilation, or fail 
to be himself in all the power, fullness and plenitude of 
his Godlike personality.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">4. “The restitution of all things.”</hi> Creation is a system 
of harmonies, as well as a system of melodies. Though 
one star differs from another star in altitude, magnitude, 
power and glory, yet each and all work in harmony with the 
God-made plan of creation, fulfilling His will and His pleasure. 
The imperceptible and incohesive elements that swim 
the airy seas, or sleep in their gulfs, or linger in space, are 
in harmony with the plan of God and the scope of creation. 
The small dust of crushed worlds, the scattered cinders of 
burnt out suns and dead planets, the broken stars and 
groaning systems writhing beneath the heavy steps of
centuries, the massive tread of cycles and the grinding 
hand of Omnipotence, are yet in harmony with 
the eternal decrees and the immortal fiats of the 
<pb id="hols119" n="119"/>
immortal King. They play on their own pivots, dance on
their burning curves, keep their eternal chronologies,
thread their long lines with angelic precision, coerce
erratic forces into line, belt their splendid onflow to the
throne of God, and weave in mysterious webs their 
incomprehensible transitions around the seat and center of
universal power. Every floating molecule, every winged
atom, every breath that glides on sea and air, or leaps the
mighty channels of space, is in harmony with the Creator,
God. Every string, cord, thread and silken fibre of the
universal mechanism is in place. Every spindle, wheel,
piston-rod and cylinder moves on in splendid flight and
Jehovic harmony, and all is well, and all obey the high 
behests of the imperial mandates. The centuries, as the
crowned kings of the cycles, and the decades as the crowned
queens of the centuries, tabulate their chronologies upon
the mind of God, and write their feats upon the eternal
ledger of the eternities, and every system is in its place,
and ultimately reaches its great ends and wonderful 
designs. Our earth is the servant of God. It is a spark from
the anvil of his omnipotence and practical mandates. God
made it and threw it upon its belted rim of fire and told it
to play on its orbit and sing on its winged track around
the King of day. He covered its continents and islands
and towering hills, with trees, flowers and, grassy 
landscapes, and said to its flora and fauna, “Bud and bloom and
blush on forever.” The billowing waves of the seas, the
thundering torrents leaping and screaming over the shoulders
and giant bones of the eternal rocks, roll on in their 
majesty and splendid trim as if impelled by the presence of 
God. Night and day, winter and summer, spring and 
autumn, and the windy blasts of the seasons, move at his 
command, keep his law, and sleep upon their dusky pillows at 
his will. All the elements, forces and agencies are held as
<pb id="hols120" n="120"/>
golden strings in his hands, and every part of the universal
mechanism is filled with his power and plethoric with
the music of his great name and the melodies of his love.
He “maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of
fire.” The beasts of the field, the birds of the air, with all
the finny nations of the deep, and the billions of the insect
tribes that rest, creep or soar, sing in their sportive glee,
and in sweet obedience chant the name of God in
the forest and on the high keys of the air. Every
winged lightning, every breath of ether that fans sea
or land, and every ray of light that dances the plains,
and all the trooping wonders of the ethereal ways,
run and return at God's command, covering the 
hemispheres with his smile, yoking the moving caravans to their
centers of action and their dynamic thrones. The centuries
and cycles, stepping through geological chronologies and
the genealogies of worlds, have faithfully kept the ways
of God, and in the sealed book of fates have recorded their
acts in the annals of his providence and have written the
history of their life, work and character, in the eternal
ledger. The name of every dead child, and of every living
spirit, the recorded birth of worlds and the death of planets,
and the funeral dirge of sinking systems that have lived and
finished their mighty rounds in awful space, have been piled
at his throne, and laid at his feet in obedience to his word.
He speaks, and all the elements, agencies, and the living and
erratic forces of eternal duration crowd to their places, 
re-gather their threads of construction, take up their 
appropriate rounds, and crown the whole law of God with the
silent splendors of perfect obedience, fulfilling his will and
pleasure.</p>
          <p>But who, then, are sinners? What vile hand or puny 
arm has been lifted up against the law of God and the 
<sic corr="omnipotence">omipotence</sic> of the Most High? What rebel in the vast
<pb id="hols121" n="121"/>
domain of being has risen up and assaulted the ramparts
of heaven and defied the King of saints? Let creation 
answer! Standing on the rocky promontory, at the flinty base
of a mountain, where the emerald lips of the foamy seas
kiss its bony feet, and where the dashing currents from
every island, land and shore bring back the tidings of 
nations, and hum the music of the spheres, I ask them the
story of their being, and in loud acclaim, accentuated with
the harmonies of God, and the dictates of his love, they 
reply that we have all kept “thy law” from youth to hoary 
years, and from their natal day, when God “set bars and 
doors” to the seas, and said, “Hitherto shalt thou come, but 
no farther, and here shall thy proud waves be stayed.” I 
ask the winds whence they came, and with united breath 
they whistle the name of God, thunder his commandments 
over earth, air and seas, and hide beneath the sable bands of 
death. Walking down the azure paths of the seasons, roseate 
spring with bursting bud and blushing flowers is seen 
breaking the icy fetters of winter, expelling the hoar frost 
and crowning creation with a wreath of flowers, and 
wrapping her in silken robes of queenly trim and dazzling 
beauty. This is “the unity of nature and the reign of law.”</p>
          <p>On the outside of this “unity and reign of law,” there is 
a discordant element, and an inharmonious string in the 
common diapason, composed of a rebel host, a 
sin-smitten earth and a perverse humanity. Great was 
the fall of man, because it involved the fundamentals of 
government, the moral harmony of the universe, and 
affected the physical spheres. It affected the spiritual, 
moral and indestructible nature of man to an extent that 
changed his relations to God, and the regular order of 
his divine administration. A new combination of 
elements, including the federation of great totalities, must 
be evoked, and brought upon the drama of government, and
<pb id="hols122" n="122"/>
operated on those planes and lines in total and strict 
accordance with truth and righteousness. The great God
could not do wrong, but he could have mercy and send it to
earth in the person of his Son. Hence, Christ came not to
<hi rend="italics">destroy,</hi> but to restore; not to condemn, but to save; not to
bring hell, but to bring heaven; not darkness, but light;
not disease, but health; not death, but life; therefore, he
came to “restore all things.” He came to recast and set
up the fallen temple of a broken humanity, reassemble its
scattered parts and thrill its entirety with the ancient
<hi rend="italics">Shekinah.</hi> Humanity is to be restored, but how? “Not
by might, nor by power,” but by Jesus Christ—the living-vital 
Christ—who is to take charge of the forces of nature,
the elements, agencies and all the powers, natures, 
combinations, federations, fraternities, leagues, societies, 
constitutions, and all the active potentialities and grand totalities
that operate upon the expanding horizon of universal
humanity. God said to his Son, “Ask of me, and I will give
thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost
parts of the earth for thy possessions.” Again, “Behold, a
king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in
judgment. And a man shall be as a hiding place from the
wind and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a
dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.
And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears
of them that hear shall hearken.” All things shall hearken
to his voice, dance at the touches of his fingers, and vibrate
at the majesty of his power. Every element, quantity, 
faculty and quality in the intricate mechanism of the 
universal order will be manipulated, wrought into beauty and
harmony and made to assume its ancient relations by the
coercive hand of the Eternal.</p>
          <p>“The restitution of all things” includes the suspension of
war, the nullification of corrupting institutions, and the
<pb id="hols123" n="123"/>
overthrow of the massive conclaves of sin and infidelity 
that have poisoned the nations, slain their millions and left 
their writhing bodies, broken bones and bleeding carcasses 
in their track of death. It means the close of the saloon, the 
overthrow of drunkenness, the destruction of the opium 
traffic, the fall of slavery in every form, the purification of 
human society, the breaking of the prisoner's chains, 
and the freedom of the long-bound captive. It means the 
destruction and the total overthrow of all the forms, codes, 
teachings and ungodly practices of heathen priests and their 
superstitious systems of ill-founded theories and false 
religions. It means the fall of empires, the dissolution of 
kingdoms, the disintegration of states, and the perishing 
of municipalities, and the obliteration of every opposing 
foe and antagonizing power. Who can stand before the 
power of the Eternal, stay his hand and stop his kingdom? 
Look up, ye sons and daughters of God, get ready for the 
coming of the bridegroom. Fill your vessels with the 
oil of his truth, “trim the golden flame,” buckle on your 
sandals, girt your habit and march out to the music of 
his voice, and the choruses of his love. Look up, he 
is coming! I hear the tramp of horses, the hum of 
chariots, the blasts of bugles, bands of music and the thunders
of a moving army. Swift-running feet skip lightly 
along the horizon, and wings of majesty flash on the 
zones, and inflame their parallels with his presence and 
the light of his countenance. The throne of earth's 
new King is set “on Zion's hill.” Around him flash the 
crowned princes, the dignitaries of state, the majesties of 
empires, the governors of provinces, and the mayors of 
cities. These bring up the threads of government, make 
them fast to Jehovah's chair and bind them to the foot of 
his throne. “The earth is the Lord's and the fullness 
thereof.” Hallelujah! the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.</p>

          <head>Deep Concern for the Welfare of Zion.</head>
          <epigraph>
            <p>“For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's
sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness,
and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.”—Isaiah 62:1.</p>
          </epigraph>
          <p>The language of the prophet involves a deep concern
respecting the Zion of God, the spread of the truth and
the extension of an organized Christianity. Every true
believer in the gospel of Christ, and especially every 
minister, should feel the same impulse and burning desire for
the extension of the kingdom of Christ that glowed
in the prophet's heart and flamed upon the prophet's
tongue. It is a most healthy and significant fact that
characterizes all the true children of God, that they have
an ardent desire and a consuming zeal to spread the
truth and make others feel, hope, and live as they do.
The first impulse of the young Christian is to tell others
that he has found the Christ of whom the prophets wrote,
and who, in subsequent years died upon the cross to 
demonstrate and seal the truth of his mission and doctrine
by his death. “Zion” and “Jerusalem,” are used as
representative of the earthly city of God—the capital and 
metropolis of the Jewish theocratical kingdom. It was 
Jewish, because its subjects and inhabitants were 
of that race. It was theocratic because God was 
the only and legal King thereof. As a capital and 
metropolis, it represented more than its mere own existence
and form of government. In the highest and fullest 
sense it represented a kingdom yet to come—a spiritual 
empire that should fill the whole earth with the glory of 
God in the triumph over sin and the salvation of 
universal man. “Zion” is the templed hill from which the
<pb id="hols125" n="125"/>
divine word and laws should be issued for the government 
of man and the propagation of those edicts and 
stern decrees that claim the allegiance and obedience 
of all intelligent beings. For says the Scriptures, “The 
law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord 
from Jerusalem.”</p>
          <p>1. Let us consider the spiritual “Zion” with Christ 
its reigning King.</p>
          <p>We must repeat here the fact that Christ is the reigning 
and true king of Zion, though not reigning in a human 
or physical sense. In this sense, he does not appear 
in regal splendor and as dictator over the earthly affairs 
of men. As yet, he has neither throne, nor crown, nor 
earthly dominion. These are to come in his glorious 
future. For the physical earth and heavens, with all the 
elements and resources of endless nature, belong to Christ 
in as true a sense as the spiritual and invisible. The seen 
and the unseen, and even the unseeable, with all their 
tangible and intangible entities, are in the range of his 
touch and his controlling power. But for the present, 
and a specific time measured by centuries, his operative 
forces are those that lie in the field of spiritual power and 
that divine energy by whose formative and mysterious 
operations creation sprang into being and man into light 
and life. How long his reign is to continue spiritual and 
invisible as it is at present is a great and profound 
question that the great future alone can fully answer. But
according to the Scriptures, he is to reign until “he hath 
put all enemies under his feet.” “Then shall the Son also 
himself be subject unto him that put all things under 
him, that God may be all in all.” Again, says the Apostle, 
“Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered 
up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall 
have put down all rule and all authority and power.” So 
that from the Word of God we learn that the spiritual 
reign of Christ is restricted to the length of certain 
<pb id="hols126" n="126"/>
periods or centuries, when in some vital form the phase of 
his kingship shall be changed, or, in other words, “He 
shall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father,” 
“that God may be all in all.” Christ will not cease 
to reign, no matter what may be the change or peculiar 
transformation of his spiritual and physical empire. 
Evidently, the Scriptures present to us at least two forms
of his reign. The first form is purely spiritual and 
invisible, and is the formulative and transforming period 
of the human church state. This is the state in which 
we now live, familiarly known as “the gospel dispensation.” 
This gospel dispensation was fully developed on 
the day of Pentecost, when an organized Christianity 
became intensive and extensive by being endued with 
power from on high. This is the beginning of the 
mediatorial reign of Christ in the shape and capacity of a 
redeemer. This mediatorial reign is to continue to “the 
end” of the restricted period when he shall have finished 
the work of human redemption, in the destruction and 
overthrow of every foe and every opposing element and 
power that hinders the spread and success of the gospel 
system. Now, Christ is the Apostle and High Priest of 
our salvation under whose direction is the organized 
church, with its living ministry, with the silent, yet 
powerful spirit operating in the world, reproving “the 
world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.” 
The processes of the redemptive scheme to human 
conception seem slow, creeping along the paths and highways 
of the ages and the civilizations of man, contending 
with perverse human nature, and the obstructive 
forces of sin and Satan. Yet gradually and surely “the
end” cometh when he shall put down all rule and authority
—all organized forces, powers and elements—of wicked 
men and devils, and at “the end” of the prolonged 
struggle, Christ shall present to his Father the world 
redeemed and the finished church as a chaste virgin without
spot or wrinkle. </p>
          <pb id="hols127" n="127"/>
          <p>
            <hi rend="italics">2. Christianity is first intensive and then extensive.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>Intensive because it involves the greatest interest of
man, and plays upon the deepest chords of his being, and
thrills the resonant depths of his soul with God and
heaven and an endless salvation. In the text it is called
“brightness” and “a lamp that burneth.” Says “the
sweet singer of Israel,” “Thy word is a lamp unto my
feet, and a light unto my path.” The blessed Saviour
says, “I am the light of the world.” The prophets wrote
of the gospel age as “light.” “The people which sat in
darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the
region and shadow of death light is sprung up.” He is
a light for the Gentiles; “to open the blind eyes, to bring
out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in
darkness out of the prison house.” “And the Gentiles
shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness 
of thy rising.” All these passages adumbrate the
intensive forces of a nascent Christianity. Entering the
arena of thought and action, it glows, sparkles, and flames
as “a lamp that burneth.” From the intensive elements
of Christianity, from its heat and flame, throwing its
bright light along the centers of social and civil life,
comes that force and spiritual power by which the church
is extended, and the gospel of truth is sent to the remotest 
parts of the habitable earth. As light and heat are
the greatest forces in physical nature—the creators of
energy—so spiritual light and the heat of God's love are
the greatest forces in spiritual nature—the creators of
thrift and go, bringing into active service all the latent
powers of the church and ministry, to extend its 
influence and its saving grace to all the race of Adam. Man
needs an intensive or forceful Christianity. Any 
religion that is <sic corr="beneficent">benificent</sic> and calculated to elevate and save
the human race, must be forceful and capable of adaptation 
to all the ages and conditions of men. It must be
commensurate with their spiritual needs and ethical 
<pb id="hols128" n="128"/>
requirements. It must be accessible to the poor and 
unlearned as well as to the learned, the rich, and the powerful. 
The very fact that the Christian religion has all 
the needed elements in richest profusion, demonstrates 
its divine origin, and proves it to be of heavenly extraction. 
The goodness, the wisdom, the love, and the power 
of God are thereby exhibited in the system.</p>
          <p>But why should it be forceful and glow with intensive 
fire? Because it proposes to do what nothing else can 
do. It proposes to save man from all of his foes, such
as sin and Satan and his own crooked and perverse 
nature. It proposes to renovate and restore the human 
kind to God's favor, enable man to regain his lost 
prestige, purify, and give chastity and dignity to human 
nature and the civilizations of the world. And this is a
more wonderful work which Christianity proposes to do,
when we consider the vileness, the hardness, the deep
depravity and perverseness of the human race. Man is
a sinner. His race is the sinning race. He rebels
against the laws of God and nature because he wills to
rebel. It is not within the range of possibilities for him
to cure and restore his fallen and depraved self. 
Intelligence and personal culture, with all the accomplishments 
and possibilities of his own efforts cannot reach 
the deep-seated malady that dwells within and contaminates 
the fountain of his being, corrupting every stream
and poisoning every spring of life. Is not man a sinner?
Man is a sinner. Misery is the proof of sin. “If thou
doest not well, sin lieth at the door,” is the declaration
of the oracles of God. If there is misery, such as
sickness, pain, sorrow, poverty, want, suffering and
death, it is the evidence that some law of God has been
violated, and these come to the <sic corr="violator">violater</sic> as a righteous
penalty from the jealous and sin-avenging God. Who
then can say there is no misery in the earth? Yea,
there is no end to the suffering of mankind in the world.
<pb id="hols129" n="129"/>
Every page of history and the annalist of every age,
tell of the horrors of wars and the mighty death-roll of
those who have fallen upon the field of sanguinary strife.
Every battle of warriors is with confused noise and 
garments rolled in blood. Religious persecution and strong
drink count their victims by the millions, crowding the
open gates of death with the pale caravans of nations.
The fever, the plague, the epidemics, sweep from the 
surface of the earth the great and the small alike. A mighty
stream of the dead forever rolls on in silent rush to the
unseen and “the great beyond.” It is the business of the
human race to come and play its part upon the stage of
life but for a few short days, and then make its exit by
death along the downward plain into the grave and 
dissolution. Great rivers may be diverted from their
courses, lakes may be drained and despoiled of their
waters, isthmuses may be cut asunder, and peninsulas
may rise from their submarine recesses and assume the
grandeur and proportions of a continent upon whose
ashy face and bony structure a thousand cities with
their mighty civilizations may exist; but none can change
the awful course of the mighty phalanxes of those 
millions that traverse the moribund ways of human life. It
is the irrevocable fiat of the great God, and the changeless 
edict of nature, that all who live must die. Who
can tell what is in the great beyond where spirits live
and move? Who can describe the place and topography
of that land covered with deepest shades and wrapt in
the dark bosom of mystery? Who can photograph its
mountains and landscapes, measure its rivers and sound
the profundity of its oceanic depths? What are the 
distinctive features of its social life and civilization, if
civilization there be? Yea, my friends, “the gates of
death” are “open” to all the living for their ingress, but
closed against the egress of the millions of the dead.
These are awful questions full of interest to every living
<pb id="hols130" n="130"/>
man upon the face of the earth, and without the solution 
of the revelations of God are a productive source of 
misery and distress to the sober and contemplative mind. 
But there is hope. The power of the gospel stretches 
beyond the shady land, and pierces its deep gorges of 
night, sounds its oceanic depths, plows up its submarine 
caverns, breaks up its bony structure, and thrills its 
valleys with the song of the resurrection, covers its dark 
mountains with light, shatters the kingdom of the dead,
breaks the bands of the sleeping millions and lifts them 
up to God and his Christ. Let us sing then,
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>Hope looks beyond the bounds of time,</l><l>When what we now deplore,</l><l>Shall rise in full immortal prime,</l><l>And bloom to fade no more.</l></lg></q></p>

          <p>Christianity is not designed to be the religion of the 
few, but of the many, indeed of all. The author of man's 
being is the author of Christianity. Man is made, but 
Christianity is not made in the sense that man is. Man 
had a beginning, and is an organized intelligence; 
Christianity is a native truth founded upon the divine nature 
of God. The fashion of its ministration and its external 
organizations may change in its phases, and its forms of

It is the state-church in one country, and the non-state-church 
in another. It may cause peace in one country 
and civil revolution in another, but everywhere it is the 
same in nature, origin, spirit and effect. The same great 
fundamental principles and truths lie at its base and 
support its indestructible superstructure. The central
and unifying principle is the Christ of God, and its 
adaptability to all the spiritual and religious needs and

conditions of men is proof of its divinity. As such, it
cannot stand still. It cannot live domiciled or nationalized 
in one country while other countries and nations are
in the darkness of ignorance and heathenism. It lives
by propagation and its diffusive elements, and is 
essentially missionary in its nature. It cannot rest at home.
Its home continents and islands are too narrow for its
extensive and expansive operations. Its life is in its
activity and agitation. The ways of the world's developments 
are the high plains of its achievements, and the
national lines of progress are its channels. The climates
of the world are its inheritance, the mountains are its
thrones and the valleys its palace gardens. The high
arch of heaven is its temple, and the spacious earth its
footstool. Its chariot wheels roll along the arteries of
commerce, and its ships plod the veins of ocean trade.
It yokes the winged lightnings to its car and whispers
the music of its Christ over the steel cables of commerce,
and shouts its sweet accents of peace from isle to isle,
and from ocean to ocean, and back to its thundering
shores. It ticks in telegraphy and hums upon its galvanized 
threads of iron, calling nations to councils of peace
and good will, and staying the bloody hand of war and
international conflict. It penetrates the continents,
searches the forests, navigates the seas to ameliorate and
save the lost and dying sinners of Adam's race. It is
the soul of progress, the life of civilization, the quickening 
power of thought and the guiding star of human
judgment. It explains the intricate problems of biological 
science and those far-reaching and important spiritual
relations that exist between God and man, and that exist
between man and his fellow-intelligences. It explains
man to himself, leading him through himself to God,
his Maker, and on through all those subtle questions
and profound inquiries that have agitated and perplexed
the thoughtful heart of man in the ages of the past. It

            <hi rend="italics">3. Organized Christianity appeals to all men for the
consecration of themselves and their wealth as a means of saving 
the world.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>“I will not rest until the righteousness thereof go forth 
as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that 
burneth.”</p>
          <p>This is an appeal to the church and the living ministry 
for perfect and thorough consecration of themselves and 
all that they are for the spread and universal diffusion 
of Christianity. Nothing but such a consecration and 
such a ministry will do or can do the great work assigned 
to it by the Author of our salvation. As instruments in 
the hand of God, the ministry of the Word and the propaganda 
of his truth must be adapted to the ends in view. 
As instrument, the ministry must partake of the spirit 
and nature of the message which it is to declare. 
Ministers must know Christ to preach him successfully to the 
nations and peoples of the earth. They must know him 
in the fulness of his love and in the fulness of his power 
and grace. As such, they must know him historically,
philosophically and in his redeeming grace and functions. 
They must know him by personal experience and 
spiritual commission. They must know him in his power to 
save from all sin in a deeper, profounder, and more 
practical sense than they know him in his mere historical life 
and character. They must know him in a higher and 
broader sense than mere philosophical <sic corr="syllogisms">sylogisms</sic> and 
premises evolved from systems of thought and reason. To 
them <hi rend="italics">he</hi>—the Christ of God—must be more than a
mythical character or allegorical hero without body or parts. 
To them he must be more than Moses to the Israelites, 
more than David to the Jews, and more than Solomon to 
the house of David. To them he must be more than 
Alexander to Macedonia, more than Cæsar to Rome, and more
<pb id="hols133" n="133"/>
than Napoleon to France. To them he must be higher 
and greater than the princes and kings of the earth, and 
greater than the angels in heaven, and all the universe 
besides. They must know him as he is—the full and 
plenipotent Son of God, in whom “all the fullness of the 
Godhead” dwells “bodily,” and as the Lamb of God that 
taketh away the sin of the world. The living ministry
must know him as the dying Saviour, as the risen God, 
the ascended Prince, the reigning King, and the 
officiating High Priest of our salvation.</p>
          <p>The work of the ministry and the operation of organized
Christianity requires not only personal consecration, 
but the setting apart of a large share of the wealth and 
material interest of man. God's plan of human redemption 
is largely dependent upon second causes, such as 
the expenditure of money, the devotion of talent, bodily 
labor, and physical exertion. Nothing can be done 
unless there is an effort made by those who are in charge 
of the affairs of the church. The law of labor and activity 
is the law of nature, and applies to physical and mental 
achievements alike. The systems of nature and grace 
are in perpetual agitation that arise from, and out of 
their own innate elements. The ebb and flow of the 
oceans purify the waters of the seas, and give life, 
vitality, glory, and beauty to the face of the earth, crowning 
the mountains with the trees of God and the smiling
valleys with the blushing rose and the blooming lily. 
Let the ocean stand still; let its bosom be smooth as 
glass and cease to lash its tide into madness, the world 
would soon be denuded of its people, and vegetation 
would droop and die. The howling winds would no longer 
whistle across the plains to carry the fresh ozone to 
the nations and living tribes of beasts, birds, buds, and
flowers. The chariot of the clouds would cease to roll 
along the skies with terrific clangor and with passive, 
repulsive obedience fall back on the placid bosom of a dead

sea, from which would arise a vapor of poisonous breath
unendurable by any living thing. The great sea is the 
breath of the world, the respiratory organs of the globe. 
By its living breath and dancing spray, the parallels and 
zones breathe the breath of life and stir the febrile 
torridity of earth's Saharas. Every respiration that 
expands our lungs and fills the blood with oxygen is a 
flying wave of living air from the mighty deep, chanting as 
it comes the music of the seas and the melodies of God. 
“O, the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge 
of God! how unsearchable are his judgments and 
his ways past finding out.”</p>

creation—work. Organized Christianity comes to work. 
It is the soul of labor and the sun of evolution. What 
the sea is to the physical earth, the religion of Jesus is 
to the moral and spiritual world. Its influence is felt 
in every civilization, and is building its temples and lifting 
its blood-stained cross in every land. Already its 
golden anthem flashes along upon its silvern threads of 
truth, begirting the globe with the sunbeams of his 
love. “Ask of me,” says the great Father to the great 
Son, “and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, 
and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.”
“Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron, thou 
shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.”

“Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O, Zion, put on thy 
beautiful garments, O, Jerusalem.” Now thrilling is 
this cry from the hill of Zion! Let the church awake, 
and stand up for Jesus. Let the rich pile their wealth 
at his feet. Let kings bring their crowns, their broken 
scepters, their hoarded wealth, and coffers of gold and 
silver, and lay them down at the cross of king Messiah. He 
has use for them all. “Oh, that men would praise the

          <head>Life and Death.</head>
          <epigraph>
            <p>“Who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and 
immortality to light through the Gospel.”—2 Tim. 1:10.</p>
          </epigraph>
          <p>In the wide realm of human thought there cannot be 
any questions of profounder concern than those involving 
the great and absorbing themes of life and death,
and their fearful consequences. Life and death are the 
antipodes of our existence upon the face of the earth, 
and constantly appeal to our consideration of their great 
moment and awful concern. The tongue of man, the pen 
of the philosophic scientist, the rapt visions of seers, 
the songs of the Muses, and the anthems of angels cannot 
bring to the contemplation of man a greater theme, 
more engrossing or charming than that involved in the 
text. Indeed, it is not possible for the mind of man to 
dwell upon matters of more interest and deeper importance 
than that of life and death. Like a shock of electricity 
it flashes on every wire, plays upon everything and 
ramifies all the deep gorges and <sic corr="labyrinthian">labyrynthian</sic> chambers 
of the moral, physical and mental man. It directs the 
thoughts and mind to those solemn realities, and those 
fascinating conditions and relations that meet him in the 
present, and await him in the endless future. It is 
worse than useless for man to attempt to reject those 
premonitory thoughts that open to his view the stern 
decrees of God, the Irresistible, the Inevitable. Life is 
the normal condition of man, death is the abnormal. 
Man was made for life, and not for death. He was made 
to live and not to die. Death is the result of sin and
disobedience. It is condign punishment for crime committed
against the majesty of heaven and the law of God. 
A state of perpetual felicity, with the faculty of progression
<pb id="hols137" n="137"/>
and development is the law of his being and the 
object of his creation. This view is anticipated by the 
wonderful construction of his physical constitution. The 
upright bearing of his body, its symmetrical beauty and 
enchanting charms, the radiance of the sparkling eye 
and beauty of the glowing cheek, the wonders of the 
human foot, and the greater wonders of the human hand; 
the astounding miracles of the voice, the communication 
of thought and feeling by word, the towering mind, the 
massive, expansive, and versatile intellect, all present 
man as the masterpiece, the highest ideal of God's 
conception of all his earthly creations. Indeed he is the 
crowning architrave of heaven's architectural skill. By 
these high attributes of greatness he stands at the head 
of all earthly creations and sublunary wonders.</p>
          <p>But the dignity of man is augmented and multiplied 
many times when we consider that ethereal spark and 
diviner subtle force which we call the <hi rend="italics">soul.</hi> And this soul 
is the master of sovereign man.</p>
          <p>Whatsoever the soul of man may be, as to its nature 
and functions and those peculiar powers enabling it to 
subsist apart from the body, it is the source, the foundation 
and spring of life. While the soul is not life itself, 
yet there can be no life without it. Thus the soul of man 
is the precious gem, the indestructible jewel “that keeps 
two worlds at strife”—the world of hell and the world 
of heaven. In fact, there is a constant and perpetual 
struggle between heaven and hell for this precious gem, 
this substantial, yet spiritual entity. Two spiritual powers
—antipodal and antagonistic—assemble their aggressive 
and gigantic hosts in battle array upon the broad 
arena of every man's existence, and with jarring tread 
and heavy tramp of war, seek to lift the soul to heaven 
or cast it down to hell.</p>
          <p>But there are many theories as to what the soul of 
man is, in its nature, attributes and origin. The 
<pb id="hols138" n="138"/>
materialistic theory is, that the soul of man is not a substance 
or reality, but a mere result of the combination of matter 
so attuned and refined as to produce results, and therefore, 
is not a thing with sensible properties in the sense 
that matter has properties. The manistic theory is 
substantially the same, in the final logical results, both 
denying the existence of spiritual substances in the 
Scripture sense. But the Scriptures declare that “the Lord 
God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed 
into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a 
living soul.” This “living soul” in man, was created by 
the breath of God, a flame kindled within by the power 
of the Creator. We observe, too, that it is a distinct 
creation from that of the body, the two creations being 
distinguished by two separate fiat acts of power. He first 
made his body “of the dust of the ground,” and made his 
soul by “the breath of his lips,” so that both body and
soul are creations proper, and not the mere result of any
peculiar combinations of matter, so adjusted as to 
produce all the phenomena and wonders of the human mind. 
Then man has two parts, the mind or the soul, and the 
body. This makes man an ideality, in eternal entity. 
He cannot be more than he is, he will never be less as to 
the nature and number of his faculties. Time or eternity, 
condition or place, can never change the nature of 
man so as to make him anything other than he is—man.</p>

            <hi rend="italics">The abolition of death is the hope of man.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>This is the work of Christ; and Christ alone. He has 
abolished death, in the sense that death can do the 
believer no real harm. It is the abolition of that death 
that involves the punishment for sin and transgressions 
committed against God and the moral code of the 
universe. This abolition of death involves the forgiveness
of sins, the reconciliation of God and man, and the 
redemption and salvation of all who come to Jesus Christ 
as the Saviour of the world. Christ came as God's 
<pb id="hols139" n="139"/>
Interpreter, a heavenly Legate with plenipotentiary powers 
to make plain the will and laws of God to sinful and 
rebellious man. He uncovers the mystery of God that
could not be explained by the wisdom, research, and 
learning of man so as to annul the power of death and 
take away its terrors. He does not come to destroy 
natural or corporeal death, but to remove the sting of 
death, and release us from punishment eternal, and give 
us joys everlasting. Hence, “he taught them as one having
authority and not as the Scribes.” Death, then, is the 
first great foe to be overcome or destroyed. This was a 
work that all humanity combined could not do. It was 
not in the capacity of the dying to remove or destroy a 
power greater than itself, and there was no process or 
method known to mankind to remedy the defect or evade 
the results of sin. The sinner cannot heal himself of a 
spiritual malady that requires more skill and power than 
was in the sinner. Again, Christ has a complete knowledge 
of the state of man. He had the most perfect and 
minute comprehension of all those principles and 
elements that existed in man, and which had been
disjointed and confused by transgressions and sins. 
Being man himself as well as God, he comprehends the 
remedy as well as the disease. To destroy death he must 
die himself, and to raise the dead, he himself must rise, 
and to break the force of the grave, he must enter its 
dark and cold precincts and tread the dark “valley of 
the shadow of death.” To save man, he must become 
man with all his pains, his sorrows, his tears and all those 
death agonies through which every man must pass. “For 
as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and 
blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same, that 
through death, he might destroy him that had the power 
of death, that is, the devil; and deliver those who through 
fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.” </p>

          </p>
          <pb id="hols140" n="140"/>
          <p>Death is the antithesis of life, the removal of the spirit
from the body, the extraction of the moving and 
animating principle from the material machinery. It is a
profound quietism and the disintegration of all of the
bodily parts. This is natural death, pure and simple,
This, Christ did not come to abolish in the immediate
sense. But spiritual death is the death of the soul—the
punishment of the spiritual and mental man, in a state of
consciousness and personal identity. There is no death
in the sense of annihilation. Dead men are not annihilated. 
Their bodies are disintegrated, and their souls
are in the spirit world, but they still retain all the faculties 
of their being. Indeed, death cannot shake off human
character or personal identity, or utterly obliterate
those distinguishing features that characterize intelligent
existence. Even man himself cannot devise any means
to destroy himself in the sense of annihilation, because
he is a stern entity, whose eternal decrees forbid his
nonentity. Could an intelligent creature thus make his
place a blank in creation, the will of God would be 
defeated, and his moral government could not be 
maintained. No, when the sinner lands in the state of 
punishment, he will still be all that he was in life and 
character. He will carry with him all the consciousness and
vividness of memory that he ever had in this state of
trial and probation. State or condition cannot change
character nor mental personality. He will be himself
in spite of himself, and in spite of all the efforts he may
make to become nothing. He may treasure up unto
himself “wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation
of the righteous judgment of God,” yet he cannot remove
himself from the Creator, and thus evade “the day of
wrath” and those awful responsibilities that belong to
him as a moral being, because of his free moral agency.
The elements and properties of man's being make him an
everlasting entirety as a part of the permanent fixture
<pb id="hols141" n="141"/>
of the universe, a real part of the most real elements—
the mental part. No other being can fill his place in the 
eternal series and concatenations of the endless 
creations of God. He is an essential part of the moral 
universe that cannot be extracted or separated from it, and 
every single individual of the race must fill his own place 
in the mighty series of responsibility. There is a 
personal responsibility and moral obligation involved in 
human existence that cannot be escaped or evaded by shifting 
it upon the shoulders of others, or by sinking it in 
some deep and unknown part of the universe. We cannot 
hide our obligations any more than we can hide our 
sins and crimes which are written upon the tablets of 
the heart and wrapt up in the convolutions of the soul. 
Man cannot hide from God any more than he can hide 
from himself, and he can as soon flee from himself as he 
can flee from God or the moral universe of which he 
forms an essential part and an inextricable force. He 
makes <hi rend="italics">one</hi> in the vast number intelligent individuals, 
and is a link in the great chain of being that threads the 
fiat acts of God, making each man a part of every other 
in the most minute and mutual relation. Because 
of the high dignity, spirituality and indestructible 
individualism of man his annihilation (if such were possible) 
would unbalance the moral sphere, and throw out of 
harmony the moral government of God, affecting every 
interest and part of moral and intelligent existence. 
The great chains of creation's symphonetic links would 
become disorganized and stripped of those consonant 
and responsive octachords that have for interminable 
ages made the universal diapason a system of wonderful 
and amazing harmonies, transcending the comprehension 
of men and angels and all the towering intellects of the 
universe. How, then, can man be annihilated any more 
than the universe can be? Is he not an important part of 
the great whole, made in the image of God? Nay, nay,
<pb id="hols142" n="142"/>
friends, the stars may fall, and heaven and earth may 
pass away as they must in the coming ages, but man, 
the offspring of God, will hold his place in the economy 
of God, and the native eternity of his being. Since he 
has begun to <hi rend="italics">be,</hi> and since he does <hi rend="italics">exist,</hi> creation would 
be without its crown and the preponderating element in 
the absence of man. Man, then, is an important element 
in the creations of God, comprehending in his being the 
physical, spiritual and mental parts that belong in 
common to all the kingdoms and dominions of God. And
because of these relations in his origin and nature, he 
must be an interesting object to all other intelligent 
creatures of the worlds of the universe.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">But man is immortal.</hi> He shall live forever in some 
place in the universe. In the onflow of his days, four 
great facts surround his being. These are, place, state, 
development and his service or religion. These are the 
main and central facts of his future. The place that he 
shall occupy in the potency of his being is designated 
under the relative terms of <hi rend="italics">heaven</hi> and <hi rend="italics">hell</hi>—the two 
extremes of the moral pole. Whosoever is in heaven is 
not in hell, and whosoever is not in heaven is in hell. At 
the end of every man's physical life stands the open gate 
of heaven or the open gate of hell, and nothing can divert 
his rapid course to one or to the other. Propelled by his 
eternal destiny, and forced on by inexorable decrees, he 
traverses the dark and cold territory of death, and enters 
his everlasting habitation. His home is found, and his 
place is fixed, and he begins his eternal rounds in the 
infinite domains of place and space. Man may not be 
confined to a small hemisphere, either in heaven, or in 
hell. Wide, deep and high may be the prison house of 
the lost—a world of darkness where no suns burn, no 
stars twinkle, no comets flash, no meteors blaze, and no 
“pale empress of the night” smiles on a darkened world
—a world where no orb of fire ever sent a rippling rill of

flame across its dark mountains, nor plowed those abysmal
depths of interminable night. The place may be a 
house with steel gates and adamantine floors, with 
rock-ribbed mountains of impassable heights, from whose fiery 
summits sentinels of towering blasts forever play upon 
angry floods and burning seas—a place where every man 
is against every other man, and where envy, anger, 
hatred, malice, lust and pride fill every heart, and falsehood 
and slander ride supreme on every tongue—a place of 
perpetual strife and endless war, endless in duration and 
endless in the depth of its vileness and infamy—a place 
where spirits bold and daring meet in dreadful conflict 
and battle array with clashing sabres playing upon the 
bosom of the deep in the plenitude of power and the 
darkness of the night. But hear it, prison house of 
the lost, with your gates of steel and adamantine floors, 
where no suns burn, nor stars twinkle, where no comets
flash nor meteors blaze, no “pale empress of the night” 
smile on a darkened world, where no orb of fire has sent 
a rippling rill of flame across thy dark mountains, nor 
plowed those abysmal depths of interminable night. 
Hear it, ye spirits bold and daring, with your clashing 
sabres playing upon the bosom of the deep in the plenitude 
of power and in the darkness of hell. Man is immortal, 
and has endless development and endless progression,
whether he is in heaven or in hell. Man, then, is a gem.

seas. His triumphant chariot rolls along on the declivities 
of the ages and through the cities and rural plains 
of all the people, breaking the bones of the nations, 
crushing out the life and vital powers and spattering the 
blood of the dead and dying millions on his own 
garments amid the shrieks and cries of weeping thousands 
and the lamentations of the people. His track along the 
ages is marked by painted sepulchres, mausoleums, 
sarcophagi and widespread cities of the dead. Cruel and 
relentless, he invades the sacred precincts of every family, 
greedily plucking the blooming infant from the mother's 
breast, and the darling child from the downy lap of ease, 
transporting them to the eternal city of ineffable brightness
far beyond its narrow sea. Before him, thrones 
topple, crowned heads fall, empires quiver, sceptres 
break, kingdoms disintegrate, and States crumble into 
dust. At his command warriors bow, armies flee, swords 
are sheathed, and belching cannon cease to play on the 
bloody arena of death. His quivers are filled with 
arrows poisoned with the venom of serpents and the pangs 
of asps that fly thick and fast from his bow. The 
winds are his horses, the zephyr his chariots, and the 
blushing rose and smiling lilies of the plains his 
boudoir. He “lurks in every flower,” ripples in the curling 
flood, whistles in the winds, screaks in the storm, 
thunders in the air, and bellows in the earthquake,
sweeping the zones and parallels of earth with the dense 
shades of Hades and the smoke and fumes of Tartarus. 
He has plucked crowns from kings, jewels from queens, 
gold plate from emperors and gems from princes and
rulers. Who can stand before him and resist his power? 
“Who can open the doors of his face?” “He esteemeth 
iron as straw and brass as rotten wood.” “The arrow

He opens “the doors of his face” and unhorses the proud 
rider, for he “hath abolished death,” broken his long 
reign, taken away his terrors, demolished his throne, 
scattered his kingdom and rent his empire into pieces, 
and set the captives free. “If the Son therefore shall 
make you free, ye shall be free indeed.” “Death hath 
no dominion over” the believer. But the abolition of 
death means that all the children of God shall be beyond 
the reach or possibility of death in that blessed place 
and future home. We know it is a future, and according 
to the Scriptures of truth it must be a place, a place 
of all the realities, perfections, splendors, glories and 
magnificences that are befitting in its wonders and elaborate 
arrangements for the throne of Christ, with all the 
equipages, powers and necessities that belong to a city 
of the greatest of all kings. “There God the Son forever 
reigns, and scatters night away.” There are no “cities 
of the dead,” nor grave-diggers, nor coffin-makers, nor 
black hearses, nor mournful wails of the funeral train; 
for death is absent—slain by “the Prince of life”—his 
kingdom dissolved, his scepter broken, and heaven shouts 
on through the ages, and fills the rolling cycles with the 
anthems of redemption and the glories of Messiah's 
triumphs. Amen! Amen!</p>

          <head>The Insufficiency of the Wisdom of Man.</head>
          <epigraph>
            <p>“That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in 
the power of God.”—1 Cor. II:5.</p>
          </epigraph>
          <p>The author of this epistle is the Apostle Paul, who 
was, at that time, in the great city of Ephesus. He had 
spent nearly two years of his apostolic life in Corinth, 
at which place he had planted that important church, 
to whom this first epistle was addressed. Having lived 
in Corinth for nearly two years, and having become 
familiar with the people, he was peculiarly prepared to 
instruct them in all the doctrines, principles, and practices 
of the Christian religion. There was much in the church 
that was contrary to the plainest principles, doctrines, 
and precepts of Christ. Under these conditions, it 
became the imperative duty of the Apostle to correct those 
errors which were then prevalent in the Corinthian 
church. Parties and divisions had grown up among 
them, and schism and discord began to do great damage 
to them as followers of the meek and lowly Jesus. For 
those who recommended to the unbelievers the great 
truths of Christianity which they professed, should 
themselves show it by their well-ordered conduct. “Every one 
of you” says the Apostle, “saith, I am of Paul, and I of 
Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.” Here we have 
four distinct parties in the Corinthian church. The first 
party was made up of those Christians that had been
converted from Paganism. This was the St. Paul party. 
The second party or division was that of Apollos. These 
were made up of those who wanted to mix religion with 
Grecian philosophy, and engraft upon the Christian 
system those philosophical tendencies that then 
<pb id="hols147" n="147"/>
prevailed in Greece and Alexandria. The third party was
for Peter. They favored the mixing of Judaism with
Christianity. They thought that a little sprinkling of
Judaism over Christianity would make the doctrine and
precepts of Christ more acceptable to the unbelieving
Jew. How much like our modern ritualistics. They
are blind to the substance, but grasp at the shadow, and
are content to live in the mere shade of the tree of 
Christianity without enjoying its wholesome fruits. The
fourth party was for Christ. They wanted no leader
but Christ. They seemed to have thought that Paul,
Apollos, and Cephas had transcended the powers delegated 
to them by Christ, and, therefore, it would seem best
to them to throw off and discard their authority. Some
of our modern religious partisans still retain this fourth
party spirit. Extremes are dangerous, especially when
driven by the storms of partisan interests. When we
follow men, we should follow them only as they follow
Christ. When they cease to follow Christ it is the part of
wisdom, and will add to our happiness and peace to
leave them to themselves. Paul, Apollos and Cephas
were all servants—ministers of the word. They could
sow and plant, and they could dig the soil and cast in the
seed, and water, but Christ alone must give the increase.
How different is this from the Corinthian idea of propriety! 
Corinth was a place noted for its learning, wisdom, 
and erudition, but it was “the wisdom of men.” It 
consisted in philosophizing upon those wonderful and 
profound subjects that belong alone in the province of 
Revelation, into whose mysterious precincts none but God can
enter. The city was renowned for its wealth, luxury and
refinement, as well as for its learning and the ingenuity
of its citizens. Equally noted and attractive was the
magnificence of its buildings. Splendid palaces, theaters,
elegant temples, and other public buildings, beautified
and adorned with the greatest architectural skill, rose
<pb id="hols148" n="148"/>
to the height of sublime altitudes in every part of the 
city. Statues, columns, capitals, and bases, were the 
pride of the inhabitants, and the admiration of strangers. 
The citadel was built upon a mountain which overlooked 
the city, and was called “Acro-Corinthus.” The temple 
of Neptune, celebrated for having a thousand slaves, or 
prostitutes, devoted to licentiousness and the lewdness 
of the people, had its influence upon the morals of the 
Christian Church, and gave it lax ideas respecting the 
true spirit, nature, and practice of the precepts of 
Christianity. As Corinth was celebrated for its marvelous 
schools of philosophy and rhetoric, it was easy for the 
church to suppose that the great truths of the gospel 
should at least be clothed in the magnificent paraphernalia 
of philosophical and rhetorical diction. The 
sciences and the arts were carried to such great perfection, 
that Cicero terms it, “The light of all Greece.” Florus 
called it “The adornment of all Greece.” When we 
take a survey along the centuries of Grecian life and 
civilization, taking in the city of Corinth as the best specimen 
of that civilization, we form some conceptions of 
the true character of its being and life. While looking 
into the social, civic, and religious life, two things are 
particularly prominent, and that is, that learning and
licentiousness, both great in degree and kind, should 
be so closely wedded, and go hand in hand, amid 
great learning and social refinement. In other words, 
it is remarkable, how, under the influence of so much 
learning, that there should continue to exist so much 
debauchery among its learned and intelligent inhabitants. 
The temple of Neptune, situated in the central 
part of the city, with its thousand vile prostitutes, 
threw its dreadful and polluting contagion over the 
whole of that populous and proud city, contaminating 
the entire social state. Strangers from all parts came 
to her as to a mart of science, law, and art, and likewise
<pb id="hols149" n="149"/>
fell under the moral plague that was then destroying 
their great civilization. Splendid orators, magnificent 
public speakers, made the great halls of the theaters ring 
with powerful eloquence upon theories of science, law 
and art. Symphonious notes of the muses and melodies 
of the spheres, throbbed and thrilled the enchanted 
souls of the spectators, and wrapt and ravished their 
spirits in visions of pleasure and ecstasies of delight. 
Situated on an isthmus between two seas, she became a
great commercial emporium, and in consequence of which
her merchants became princes, and her people opulent,
while luxuries poured in and held universal sway, bringing 
with them that ease and fulness of bread which 
accompany a debased, profligate, and declining 
civilization. Taking this view of the subject, how reasonable 
and appropriate it was for St. Paul, being fully 
acquainted with Grecian life and the errors and the 
weakness of Grecian philosophy, to exhort: “Your faith
should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power
of God.”</p>
          <p>1. The wisdom here spoken of is called “the wisdom 
of this world,” “the wisdom of men.” This wisdom 
consists in the theories and the philosophical reasonings that 
obtained in the Grecian schools respecting those things 
that can be only subjects of Revelation. The rules that 
govern it, the subjects discussed and the conclusions 
reached by the unaided faculties of man, are “of this 
world” in contradistinction to the wisdom of God set 
forth in the Scriptures of truth. The mere term, wisdom,
is of great latitude, and includes the wise application of
knowledge so used as to reach and accomplish the best 
ends. Wisdom and knowledge are often used 
interchangeably, when, in truth, they are two distinct things. 
Knowledge is to know, or understand the relation of 
things, while it is the province of wisdom to select the 
best means to accomplish the best ends. In the Scriptures
<pb id="hols150" n="150"/>
it often means “right judgment and feeling” respecting
“religion and moral truth.” “Behold, the fear of the 
Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is 
understanding.” (Job XXVIII. :28.) A man may have a great 
deal of knowledge and yet be imprudent, impractical, and 
unwise. He may see the ends to be reached, but how to 
reach them he cannot tell. Knowledge hews the rough 
stones for the building, wisdom piles the whole into a 
majestic temple of beauty and symmetrical proportions.
Knowledge is the prepared materials, wisdom is the 
house built and made ready for habitation. But “the 
wisdom of men” here spoken of may mean any system 
or code of ethics, or moral philosophy, taught by “the 
wise and prudent” of this world, and in this particular 
case, has reference to the systems of religion and 
philosophy that then prevailed in Alexandria and the 
Grecian cities.</p>
          <p>2. There is a profuse religious tendency existing in 
the moral nature of man that cannot be smothered or 
eradicated. Its voice is stentorian, continuous and 
electrifying in spite of the wickedness of his heart. It is a 
part of him—an element of his moral stamina. It is 
natural for him to be religious, and unnatural for him to 
be irreligious, and he comes nearest to occupying his 
original and ancient relation with his Creator, when he 
is worshiping God in spirit and in truth. Since the fall 
of man, this relation can only be attained by the atonement 
of Christ and the plan of reconciliation instituted 
by him. Since man is a sinner, and has departed from 
God by his own chosen way, he must, if ever he does, 
return to God according to God's plan, for except God 
directs his return, he can never get back again to enjoy the 
smiles of his countenance and the warm sunshine 
of his love. He is a worshiping being, and an adoring 
servant. He will seek and give his affections and 
esteem to some real or supposed supernatural being,
<pb id="hols151" n="151"/>
whether such be real or imaginary. He has adoration 
to give; to whom shall he give it? He has petitions to 
be presented; to whom shall he present them? He has 
sorrows, pains, and grievances to be redressed; to what 
power or authority shall he present them? He has a 
heart and a whole nature to give; to whom shall he give 
them? He has an eternity to spend; with whom shall he 
spend it? Some one has the property right in man, and 
it is the design of revelation to direct him through the
meshes and labyrinthian windings to his rightful Lord 
and legitimate Master—God.</p>
          <p>The insufficiency of human wisdom to make the world 
wise unto salvation, appears in its efforts and nature, 
and in the fact that it has always proved a failure to 
supply the moral and spiritual necessities of the human 
kind. We are taught that “the world by wisdom knew 
not God.” It could not attain unto the Most High. Such 
wisdom was too great for the world to discover and 
digest to the satiety and satisfaction of the hungry soul of
man. Nothing can be more important to man than his 
eternal destiny and spiritual interests. The philosophy 
of the schools and the wisdom of the wise and prudent 
utterly incapable of managing the moral and spiritual 
interests of the human race, and in such things the wisest 
of men have made the greatest blunders. In the midst 
of so many religious proclivities, it would amount 
to the greatest catastrophe to commit the world's
spiritual, moral, and religious interests to the vague, 
subtle and unreliable theories of human devices and 
philosophical calculations; besides there are a thousand 
reasons why our “faith should not stand,” or depend 
upon “the wisdom of men, but in the power” or capacity 
“of God,” “who is able to save to the uttermost” every 
sinning and repenting child of Adam.</p>
          <p>3. Religion is man's avocation. It is his chief work 
on earth, and there is nothing for him to do in the great
<pb id="hols152" n="152"/>
world to which he must go, but to worship and adore 
that Supreme Being who is the author of his existence, 
and by whose power and will he will be perpetuated 
through the endless cycles of his being. The highest 
designs of his creation, the inspiring and noblest ends 
of his personal entity and <sic corr="ineffaceable">eneffaceable</sic> identity, fit him 
for the place of eternal service in the ever expanding
phalanxes of the worshiping and the adoring hosts. 
His nature—the attributes and faculties of his being—
cannot fulfill their functions and operate in their legitimate 
sphere if he is otherwise engaged. He is made for, 
and suited to worship, and when in true devotion to God 
alone, it is the only possible relation which he may 
sustain to the Creator and the universe for the development 
and highest evolutions and possibilities of his being. 
Time and place, and even the mode of his existence 
cannot nullify these natural, organic, God-given and eternal 
relations between the Creator and the created. The 
modes and methods of his service to God do not touch 
the indissoluble bands that hold him in eternal relation 
to his Maker and preserver. Lost spirits with changed 
state and conditions are still the servants of God in the 
sense that they still belong to him, and are a part of his 
kingdom and dominion; because, in a high and important 
sense, they still glorify the great Creator by demonstrating 
to the universe the justness of their punishment 
and the equity of his government. Even in their state
of sin and rebellion they not only feel the power and 
wrath of God, but they must admire, if not adore, that 
inexorable fiat of justice and equity that sent the rebel 
hosts pell-mell into hell. His justice is as great as his 
goodness. He is infinite in both. And the goodness 
of God is as wonderfully demonstrated in the punishment 
of the finally disobedient as it is in the saving 
and the protection of the obedient; for when the sinner
—be he man or spirit—is punished for crime, the 
<pb id="hols153" n="153"/>
interests of the intelligent universe are protected thereby 
and the executive God is vindicated in himself and by the 
judgment of his moral creatures. The great end of 
creation is the glorification of its creator, and this object 
can best be attained when the physical and moral 
elements are coerced into line and made to reach their
original designs. Of course God loves all his creatures. 
He takes no pleasure even in the death and punishment 
of the wicked. But since they are wicked and disobedient 
to the laws of God, his own love of order and 
righteousness demands that force and restraining power be 
exercised to preserve the union and peace of his empire. 
This is to be done at all hazards and in any sphere of 
the universe where there are sins and outbreaks against
the laws of God. All intelligent beings are necessarily 
and constitutionally religious, because wherever such 
creatures or beings exist, their existence is dependent 
upon a higher and pre-existent being. Since their 
existence depends upon a pre-existent being, they must be 
under certain laws known to them as the product of a 
higher power. Intellect carries with it the conceptions 
of the rule of actions and its author as the giver of that 
rule of action. None can live in absolute ignorance of 
God since they are in contact with tangible objects and 
mental conceptions, both of which can only lead up to 
the Creator, in a greater or less degree. The heavens 
declare his glory, and his invisible parts are seen in 
the creation of the world; yet the wisdom of man, 
unaided by the light of the Bible, cannot find out God to 
perfection, or in those details and degrees of his will and 
nature to that extent that is necessary to approach him 
in a manner that is most conducive to his glory and the 
happiness of man.</p>
          <p>4. “That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of 
men, but in the power of God.” That is, we must not 
rest our hope of salvation upon the philosophy, the
<pb id="hols154" n="154"/>
theories and conclusions of men, no matter how wise, 
learned, or erudite they may be, because after all they 
would be certain to be in error respecting the most 
important things that can possibly enter the mind and 
being of man. In short, in the very nature of things, if 
we would be saved, we can only be saved by a reliance 
and trust in the atonement of Christ and the mercy of 
God.</p>
          <p>Christianity begins and reaches its ends in faith, 
because “it is impossible to please God” without faith, 
for “he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and 
that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.” 
Again, says the Apostle, “Faith is the substance of 
things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”
Faith is that belief and trust which brings us to God, 
and causes us to live according to the precepts of Christ 
and his Apostles. It implies: (1) That the teachings and 
doctrines of Christ are true; (2) That since they are true a 
reliance or a trust in them for salvation, through Christ, 
as the atoning Saviour of men, is true faith, or that faith 
that saves. The fruits of faith are the inner consecration 
of man to Christ and his teachings, and a consistent 
life in the world. “By their fruits ye shall know them,” 
says the Saviour; for if there be no fruits there cannot 
be any true faith, or that faith that saves. Faith, then, 
is necessary to human salvation, since, say the Scriptures, 
without it, “it is impossible to please God.” The 
grounds and reasons for faith are in the very nature of 
man and God. God is necessarily a spirit—an 
incomprehensible and indivisible substance. He is intangible in
spirit and essence, and consequently cannot be grasped 
by the human mind in any possible state or condition in 
which the mind of man may be placed. He always was, 
and is, and always will be the incomprehensible Jehovah, 
and when the disembodied spirits of men shall ascend 
the scales of a thousand billions of rolling cycles in their 
<sic>advancive</sic> and serial development, they—the mind of
<pb id="hols155" n="155"/>
man or angels—will never reach that stage in their 
intellectual evolutions where they might become familiar 
with the Infinite. He is the intangible, the unknowable, 
the immeasurable essence of all space and time. 
He is so near, yet he dwells in an infinity so vast, deep 
and broad, that no lofty creature's thought has ever 
descended to his depth, measured to his height, or crossed 
the seat of his high and holy place. To what degrees the 
intelligent mind of a creature may know the Creator in 
the onward wake of mental progression, is an unknown 
quantity in the cycles of endless ages. The question 
itself is astounding and overpowering. It is the unthinkable 
part of eternal progression. Its endless threads of
evolutions and translations are ungatherable and hide
in the unzoned and nameless future. How then shall
men or angels or any, draw near to God? How shall
they reach the unreachable and know the unknowable?
How shall they approach unto the dwelling-place of the
Most High? “Not by might nor by power, but by” faith.
On its bright pinions we can soar along the great outlines
of his ineffable parts, cut through the clouds of darkness
and doubt and sit down under “his banner of love” in his 
bright abode.</p>
          <p>But man himself needs faith. What is impossible to
knowledge, wisdom, and philosophy, is possible to faith. 
Human wisdom is what we do for ourselves, but faith 
does for us, through God, what we cannot do for 
ourselves.</p>
          <p>5. This faith must stand “in the power of God,” and 
not “in the wisdom of men.” “The power of God” is his 
ability or capacity to do, and to execute his will, and 
fulfill his pleasure. Nothing is of greater pleasure to the 
Almighty than the salvation of sinners, and the redemption 
of that part of his intelligent offsprings that have 
violated his laws and rebelled against the government 
of heaven. The moral “power of God,” (or those convincing
<pb id="hols156" n="156"/>
and persuasive methods which he has adopted) shows 
that man has the power of choice, the ability to accept 
or reject any proposition laid down by the Almighty. 
This, of course, makes man largely responsible for his 
own salvation, since he cannot be saved unless he does as 
God commands, and comply with those requirements set 
forth in the gospel system. In the nature and fitness of 
things, the gospel system presents for man's acceptance 
the only possible plan of salvation, and to stand aloof, 
or go outside of that plan, leaves him in a state and 
condition where divine mercy cannot reach him. Christ is 
the only Saviour of men, the only gateway to God, to 
heaven, and reconciliation, and all must come through 
or by this way if they be saved at all. Hence “he tasted 
death for every man;” that is, he has prepared the way 
for the salvation of all whether they accept it or not. 
Not only has he made provision for the salvation of all
men, but has made it most ample, full, and free. And in 
the wisdom and plenitude of this provision, the worst 
of rebels and “the chief of sinners” can be saved.</p>
          <p>“The power of God” here spoken of, is not mere physical,
arbitrary force, that acts upon the material world 
with propellent and repellent forces, but is that capacity 
that inheres in the Divine Being by which he sustains 
those of his offsprings that obey his law and “keep his 
commandments.” When we “keep his commandments,” 
then he engages his infinite and exhaustless resources 
to “save to the uttermost” all who “call on the name of
the Lord.” “The power of God,” then is the foundation 
upon which the man of God hangs the cable of hope and 
the threads of his salvation. These are strong, uniting 
God and man together in the strong bands of his love 
and power, forming a spiritual compact of harmonious 
relations, unanticipated by the wisdom of man and 
unknown to the philosophical research of the schools and 
the keenest conception of the wise men of the ages.
<pb id="hols157" n="157"/>
Many have established themselves upon their own 
wrought systems of religious thought, while ignoring 
the truth of God, that great system of Divine 
Revelation which presents to men the only solution of the 
mighty problems of life and death, of the present and the 
future. Everywhere, the power of God is exhibited in 
his works as the wonderful and all-resourceful governing 
creator. “The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens, 
and his kingdom ruleth over all;” over all things in 
the visible, invisible, and the spiritual divisions of the 
universe, from the highest heaven to the deepest hell. 
Creation in its marvelous amplitude, with its contending 
and extending forces of precipitant elements, is held in 
space and place by “the word of the Lord,” and the 
invincible fiat of his power. He is the coercive God that 
throws around rebellious planets, broken systems, and
sinking suns, his golden arm of power, and adamantine
peripheries of hardest and unyielding bands of steel, 
triple-decked and serrated with mountains of flint and 
valleys of flame. At his command, shattered suns, 
corroding orbs, and dead planets mount from their “funeral 
pyre on wings of flame” and sing on their eternal rounds 
as fiery arrows from the bow strings of God. From his 
hand a thousand moons, the pale princesses of a thousand 
worlds, dazzle into space, kiss the hem of burning 
circumferences and fly on their cold silver tracks in the
unfathomable bosom of space. God speaks again, they 
hear, skip, leap, and move along their bright curves 
forever, the maid-servants of radiant orbs, the sisters of 
kings and the daughters of God. But this is a changing 
universe with an unchanging God. Eternal ages corrode 
and melt the hardest bands of steel, break asunder every 
cable, shatter every cog and bolt, take off the rim of every 
wheel, destroy every connecting link, crush in the keel of 
every floating world, blow out the fires of every orb, 
unhinge every star, dim the lustre of every sun, cut
the wings of every comet, cast down every moon from
<pb id="hols158" n="158"/>
her silver track, put out the fires of heaven, and take 
the lights from every soaring beamy car, and every 
sparkling gem from heaven's high dome, and every 
glittering pearl from the unmeasured palace of God. Yet 
he is king over all.</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“Star after star from heaven's high arch shall rush,</l>
            <l>Suns sink on suns, systems systems crush, </l>
            <l>Headlong extinct to one dark center fall, </l>
            <l>And night and death and chaos mingle all,</l>
            <l>Till o'er the wreck emerging from the storm, </l>
            <l>Immortal nature lifts her changeful form, </l>
            <l>Mounts from her funeral pyre on wings of flame, </l>
            <l>And soars and shines another and the same.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>But high above the crash of “the wreck of matter and 
the crush of worlds,” the mighty God, whose “kingdom 
ruleth over all,” maintains his power, keeps his own in 
perfect peace in his bright abode, in a clime whose 
elements and entities and component properties are 
incapable of dissolution and decay. Amid the transition 
of matter and the clashing of diverse elements and forces 
“the power of God” is pledged to keep him in perfect 
peace whose mind is staid on him. “Let not your heart 
be troubled; ye believe in God, believe also in me. In 
my Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so, 
I would have told you.” These are the blessed words of 
the Christ. Oh! brethren, your faith should stand, not 
in “the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.”</p>

          <head>Why We Should Love God.</head>
          <epigraph>
            <p>“On these two commandments hang all the law and the 
prophets.”—Matt. 22:40.</p>
          </epigraph>
          <p>The gospel of Christ is a system of divine ethics. Its
philosophic and fundamental principles are few and 
simple, and it has its claims upon the attention and 
consideration of mankind, because it affects his happiness
in the present and for all time to come. It is a system
reared upon few pillars, yet these are but the stronger
and more enduring and far-reaching because of their
foundation and simplicity. It is not a mass of unintelligible 
enigmas whose intricacies cannot be understood
or explained; but it is simple, convincing, comprehensive
teaching, fitted to instruct, elevate and save the race of
man. Its scope embraces the moral code of the universe
in its governmental theory and practice, and is a 
transcript and photograph of its moral phases. The system,
as such, is presented to our judgment, and appeals to
our reason, and then demands our faith in its Author
and in its doctrines. Faith is essential to its acceptance
and fair consideration, for “without faith it is impossible
to please God.” It is a system that breathes “the spirit
of life from God,” and quickens and brings into lively
play all its parts, spirit and elements of that life. It
defines the moral faculties, and locates God and man in
their native and true relations. As a code of morals, it
is best understood when we examine its separate parts
and primary principles, and observe those results that
flow from its practice. It has three great properties—
morals, doctrines, and faith. We can have no proper
conception of any ethical code without its elements and
primary principles. These compose the bone and framework
<pb id="hols160" n="160"/>
upon which sinew, flesh and skin are laid, and then
the purple current of life is seen to ramify, vivify and
dance through every part, diffusing light and activity
and filling its spheres with God. If we would be
the devotees of any system of religion, we must first 
partake of its spirit, become imbued with its life, learn its
idioms, dogmas, and demands. The life and power of
the one must be infused into the life of the other, and
then the outlines of our life and character must accord
with the spirit and teachings of the same, otherwise we
cannot be true disciples of the system. To meet the
spiritual necessities of the devotees, the system must not
only be true as to its real existence, but must be true
within itself. Its promises, doctrines, and predictions
must rest upon truth in such a manner as to bring sure
and certain realization to its followers and adherents,
and thereby verify itself as true. If there is a failure
here, all else is failure, intrigue and irreparable loss.
This position is more apparent when we think of the 
<sic corr="stupendous">stupenduous</sic> fact that it may promise more than it can
verify. That is, it may promise us heaven and give us
hell. It may promise us life and give us death; promise
good, and give us evil instead. It may pierce the heart
with a thousand pangs of demons, and pour into the soul
the poison of asps and the venom of serpents, and leave
the soul with blasted hope and withered spirit. For 
instance, Mohammedanism is a system of error mixed with
truth and gilded with glittering promises that it cannot
fulfil; yet it is a fact that such a thing as the system of
Mohammedanism does exist, but its existence or power to
<hi rend="italics">be</hi> does not prove that its doctrines, dogmas and idioms
are true. Yet it has the same persuasive effect upon
the mind, life and civilization of its millions of votaries as
the system of Christianity has upon its followers. Both
obtain their hold and power over their respective 
followers upon the same principles of faith, theory and
<pb id="hols161" n="161"/>
practice. The one is as conscious that his religion is 
true as the other, notwithstanding the one is false and 
the other true. Because of these conditions the followers 
of Mohammed are as devoted to their religion as the 
followers of Christ are devoted to theirs. If a man 
believes a thing to be true, when at the same time it is false, 
the same devotion and earnest faith is given to it as if 
it were true. Therefore, a system of religion does not
destroy the faith and devotion of its candid believers, 
whether true or false within itself. How important 
then it is that a system of religion, presented to the
world of man for his faith and practice, should be true 
in itself, and true in its promises, predictions and realizations. 
We need not enter here upon the divine originality, 
truth and authenticity of the Christian system. Its 
reasonableness, its powers, nature, and adaptations to 
meet the spiritual needs and the practical necessities of 
mankind in all ages and conditions, are a sufficient 
refutation of the infidel and those who doubt its truth.
Mankind will seek only that that they believe to <hi rend="italics">be</hi>, and such
exertion depends upon faith and hope and realization. 
Faith is the connecting link between God and man, 
between heaven and earth, between the visible and invisible, 
between the finite and infinite. By this we see the 
unseen, and approach the unapproachable. It brings 
us to God; it brings God to us. It humanizes God without 
making him less God, and deifies man without 
making him more than man. Christianity then is more
than a name, more than a theory, more and greater than 
even faith and practice. It is a revolution, a transformation, 
and a process of redemptive restoration, by which 
man is evolved from and out of himself, to, and into God. 
This redemptive restorative process not only changes 
the moral status between man and God, but imparts to 
man a new life, a new nature, and the infusion of the 
Deity himself. If, then, we would be Christians, we must
<pb id="hols162" n="162"/>
go farther than a mere profession, a mere assent to and 
practice of the formulas of the religion of Jesus. My 
friends, without the work of God in the soul, there 
can be no true, vital, spiritual and soul-saving 
Christianity on earth. True, we may read its history, memorize 
its language, repeat its dogmas, and chant its melodies
and shout with its heroes, yet there are depths and 
heights, lengths and breadths, still farther on in the 
great redemptive, restorative process, which by mere 
formalities can never be attained. Still farther on, 
beyond sky-blue tops of the cloud-covered mountains and 
the deep gorges of repentance, are the sacred precincts 
of a perfect salvation. We cannot be half Christian and 
half alien. We must be the one or the other. In the 
shining phalanx of the living God, there are no mongrel 
progeny, half-breeds and cross-bloods, but all are shaped 
in the same heavenly mold, and healed by the same 
cleansing blood. In this earthly pilgrimage of song, there 
are no mutes, no unstrung harps, or silent choristers. 
You must sing the enchanting melodies of heaven, or the 
bacchanalian songs of sin, moving up to heaven, or moving 
down to death. There are no neutral grounds in this 
great warfare, but fight you must. And you must fight 
for God, and against the devil, or fight for the devil and 
against God. Two kings cannot reign upon one throne; 
neither can God and Satan reign in the same heart, for
they are antagonistic and antipodal principles. If ever 
in the onward wake of the ages the world shall ever be 
redeemed from the thraldom of sin and darkness, it can 
only be accomplished by the gospel of system. Christ 
alone supplies all the wants and necessities of man in 
this and in the future state.</p>
          <p>The Jewish people are a standing miracle and living
attestation to the truth and Divine authenticity of the 
holy Scriptures. They are the most peculiar and most 
remarkable people that have ever lived upon the face of
<pb id="hols163" n="163"/>
the earth. God selected them from all the idolatrous 
nations of the earth to serve him, and to preserve the 
oracles of truth as delivered to them from time to time. 
Amid the moral and mental darkness that covered the 
earth, the Israel of God had light from heaven to guide 
them in the way of truth and moral rectitude, and in this 
respect the Jew served a great end in the salvation of
mankind, though this “peculiar people” has been 
scattered, and its polity broken into a thousand fragmentary 
parts. Their kings reign no longer. Their temple hill 
is desecrated by the Mosque of Omar and the abomination 
of the Mohammedans. They have been driven by 
the storms of persecution into every land and clime, from 
the cold north to the torrid south, and from the orient 
to the occident. The Jew lives with every nation, but 
mixes with none; and under all the varied conditions 
that have tried him through the ages, he maintains his 
identity and is still what he was three thousand years 
ago—a Jew. Though his people have been despised, 
rejected and slain by the hundreds and thousands, and 
their blood has flowed down the declivities of the ages;
though aspersions, calumnies, and vile indignities have 
been poured in fury upon their heads, still he lives amid 
them all—a Jew. The Jew can trace his historical 
pedigree through the fleeing circles of the ages and the 
dispensations of the past. The storms and howling tempests 
have rained hailstones upon his quivering bark for three 
thousand years. Empires have arisen, kings have 
reigned, states have grown up, towered and fallen, hoary 
dynasties have been broken upon the wheel of time, great
rivers have changed their beds and have cut their pathway 
through the hardest rocks, filling seas and gulfs 
with their drifting matter. In the wake of the ages and 
the march of time, the bodies of the millions have fallen, 
and their bleaching bones and “cities of the dead” tell the 
sad story of death. The tall cedars of Lebanon, and
<pb id="hols164" n="164"/>
proud oaks of Bashan, have withered by the blight of 
age; still the Jew is the same. He has outlived the ages, 
outlived the ravages of war and persecutions. He has 
lived through flood and flame, through famines, 
pestilences, endemics and epidemics. Like the Gulf Stream, 
he flows on in his own channel without mixing with 
contacting elements, whether they be Japhetic or Hamitic. 
They are God's ancient people—the repository of the
oracles of truth—and he will punish the world for the 
slain of his chosen Israel. In the economy of Providence 
he stands as a gigantic tower of strength to attest the 
truth and the Divine authority of Revelation. This is 
the standing memorial of Christianity and the miracle 
of the ages. Infidelity may rage and vent its keen shafts 
of spleen against the ramparts of God, but here is a truth 
whose impregnable parts stand the rage of the enemy 
and the assaults of hell.</p>
          <p>“Then, one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a 
question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the 
great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, 
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and 
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first 
and great commandment. And the second is like unto 
it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two
commandments hang all the law and the prophets.”</p>
          <p>Let us observe then, three reasons why we should love 
God: (1) <hi rend="italics">Because he commands us to love him.</hi> (2) <hi rend="italics">Because 
we cannot be happy without loving him. </hi>(3) <hi rend="italics">Because he first
loved us.</hi></p>
          <p>We should love God (1) <hi rend="italics">Because he commands us to love
him.</hi></p>
          <p>God is a sovereign. He has the undivided authority 
to command all creatures in earth, heaven and hell to do 
his biddings—to do or not to do certain things. He 
possesses the unquestionable right to dictate to the 
consciences of men and all intelligent beings. It does not
<pb id="hols165" n="165"/>
affect the case whether we understand the reasons why 
or not. These may be given, or they may not be given. 
They may be positive moral commands or mere edicts 
of the king immortal, yet if they are from him and apply 
to us, we cannot disregard them without condign 
punishment and destruction to our happiness. As a Father, 
Master and Ruler, he commands. As a Father, we are 
his children; as a Master, we are his servants, and as 
a Ruler we are his subjects. Whether he speaks to us as
Father, Master or Ruler we are his subjects and are bound 
to obey. We may not know at all times why he commands 
this, that, or the other. To know this is the province of 
the sovereign God, and not the province of his subjects. 
With consequences and results we have nothing to do; 
these belong to God alone. Christianity is a temple of 
truth of sublime proportion and changeless principles, 
whose stones have been hewn and polished by the hands 
of God, and placed in glorious beauty and symmetry one 
upon another in ascending scales and eternal harmony. 
“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God” is the changeless
and faultless command—changeless because founded 
upon the equity, the justice and will of the Creator. 
“The law of the Lord is perfect.” Nothing can be added 
to it or subtracted from it. There can be no review, 
supplement, nor second edition, nor amendments. It “is 
perfect” in all its parts, parcels, and ramifications. His 
“statutes are right” in their native and constitutional 
inherent qualities. True, they are the dictations of a 
Sovereign, yet they are none the less righteous and 
equitable within themselves, since they involve the 
“eternal fitness of things.” Thus we should love God—(2) 
<hi rend="italics">Because we cannot be happy without loving him.</hi> This is 
axiomatic. We have every evidence that the race of man 
was made to be happy, that the Creator originally 
designed that all his intelligent offspring should remain 
in such a state, and pursue those lines of avocation that
<pb id="hols166" n="166"/>
would redound to his glory and the greatest degree of 
their perpetual well-being. Consequently, happiness is 
the natural and universal desire of the human race. 
This also applies to all sentient and intelligent creatures, 
whether they be men or angels, and it may not be going 
too far, when we assert that even devils and lost spirits 
would repent and regain their lost estate and revert to 
bliss, if they could. Misery and pain must be utterly at 
war with the feelings and desires of all intelligences, no 
matter in what part of the universal dominion they may 
live. Even the lower animals and the non-intelligent 
parts of creation, give evidence that show that they have 
the instinct of happiness impressed upon their nature. 
The worm of the dust wriggles beneath our tread; the
wild beasts of the forest flee at the approach of man, and 
the finny tribes of the deep elude his presence; all have 
some natural means of defense and exercise a vigilance 
that shows their apprehension of danger. They fear 
death because of the pain and misery that is connected 
with it. If this is true respecting the non-intelligent, it 
is so in a larger degree among those who are “made in 
the image of God.” Man desires happiness. It is the 
natural prompting of his heart and the proclivity of his 
being. The Creator made him to live, and not to die; he 
made him to be happy, and not to be miserable. The 
faculties of the mind, the attributes of the soul, the 
construction and ease and grace of the operations of the
physical and perceptive attributes are splendidly fitted 
to promote his peace, ease and comfort upon the plane 
of his being. It has been very properly said, that “death 
is a foreign foe,” an alien and an unlawful invader into 
the kingdom of life, except as man forfeited the protection 
of God by his rebellion and the violation of those 
laws and uncompromising principles upon which alone 
his continued prosperity depends. If we would be happy
and fulfil the natural proclivities of our nature—as it
<pb id="hols167" n="167"/>
was originally intended—we must obey the laws of God, 
“and keep his commandments.” If the subjects of earthly 
governments cannot be happy without obedience to the 
laws under which they live, much less can we be happy
without obedience to those laws and changeless rules 
that the all-wise and supreme Creator has prescribed as 
the norm of action laid down for us. The end of law, 
therefore, is the glory of God in the happiness of his 
creatures. One of the plainest things in the world is the 
fact that no intelligent being can be happy when he is 
violating the principles in the universe by which alone 
it is possible to reach the goal of bliss. The Christian 
system presents to the world the only foundation of 
substantial peace and enduring bliss, because there 
can be no such thing without reconciliation with God. 
Whether in heaven, on earth, or in any other place in 
illimitable space, the same principles and facts must apply 
with undiminishing and equal force to all localities and 
beings. God is God, truth is truth, love is love, and 
fear is fear. Time or place or conditions cannot alter 
or change these. Truth on earth is truth in heaven and 
in hell. Christianity, therefore, is not the religion of 
men on earth only, but is the only true God-serving and 
God-adoring system that can exist, because it absorbs 
all those great underlying principles of love, obedience, 
and truth upon which the government of the Almighty
is founded. No, my friends, there is but one remedy in 
all the wide domain of God for human misery and human 
recovery from sin and death, and that is, “Thou shalt 
love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all 
thy soul, and with all thy mind.” It is not possible for 
any intelligent creature to be happy without Christianity. 
Let a man be placed in the most propitious condition 
possible in this life, yet he would be unhappy without 
the love of God and man. He may recline upon 
couches of down with ivory posts, studded and bedecked
<pb id="hols168" n="168"/>
with rarest gems and precious jewels and hung with the 
richest damasks of the east, while frescoed walls and 
fluted columns ascend in awful grandeur, covered with 
gold and glinted with silver. Let him eat the lambs of 
the flock and feed upon the fat of stall-fed beasts. Let 
his steeps be washed in butter, and his teeth be white 
with milk. Let his maidens sing, and with sweetest voice 
and dulcet strains of harp and organ lull their enchanted
lord to soft slumbers. Let him be a king upon a royal 
throne whose empire covers a continent with teeming 
millions to do his biddings. Let him be secure from fear 
and danger and the ramparts of his rocky castle be 
defended by the invincible legions of the Cæsars and the 
Napoleons. Let his granaries be filled, his wealth boundless, 
and his cattle cover a thousand hills, feeding upon 
the living green, richer in beauty than all the productions 
of the Persian looms. Let him in the splendors of courts 
quaff to uttermost satiety the cup of pleasure. Let 
obsequious millions bow the knee to honor and admire their
great Lord and master. Let annalists with pen in hand
and ink horn by their sides stand to record the words of 
wisdom and the mighty acts of the king. Yet with all 
this, and more, he cannot be happy without the love of 
God, and the power of the religion of Jesus. For amid 
all this marvelous wealth, honor and greatness, there is 
an accusing or excusing monitor—conscience—within 
that tells him that he is a sinner going to death and to 
hell. “The wicked fleeth when no man pursueth” and 
“are like the rough sea when it cannot rest, whose waves 
cast up mire and dirt.” Nay, there is no place, no real 
substantial happiness and peace without God in the soul, 
Christ in the heart and life, and the whole man converted, 
changed, and thoroughly consecrated to God, and separated 
from the pollutions of the flesh, and the contaminations 
of the world. How can you escape or set at naught 
these obligations? How can you or I throw off the yoke
<pb id="hols169" n="169"/>
of God and evade the momentous issues? Go, take the
flight of the eagle to his lofty aerie, and build your secret
chamber in the highest cleft of the granite peak, and
dwell solitary and alone out of the reach of your fellows.
Leave your feet in the cloud and stand upon the celestial
pyramid with careless indifference as to human affairs,
yet without Christ in the soul there is a burning hell
within that is incompatible with peace and ease of 
conscience. Even in heaven, were it possible for the sinner
to be carried there, he could not be happy without the
love of God, because he could not enjoy the glory and
pleasures of the redeemed and sanctified. There 
congenial spirits meet in the raptures of redeeming love to
celebrate in lofty anthems the praises of God and the
Lamb, saying, “Amen.” Blessing and glory and wisdom
and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be
unto our God forever and ever, amen. And one of the 
elders answered, saying unto me, “What are these which 
are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?” 
And I said unto him, “Sir, thou knowest.” And he 
said unto me, “These are they which came out of great 
tribulations and have washed their robes, and made them 
white in the blood of the Lamb.” Here are the congregated 
millions of congenial spirits. They “have washed 
their robes and made them white in the blood of the 
Lamb.” They have passed through “great tribulations,” 
swept through the zones of life's fiery trials, entered the 
city of the great king, wrapped in the shining robes of 
beauty and clothed in the bright habiliments of eternal 
salvation.</p>
          <p>(3) <hi rend="italics">We should love God because he first loved us.</hi></p>
          <p>“Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed 
upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.” 
What a lofty title is this, and yet it is true—“The sons 
of God!” John says, “Hereby perceive we the love of 
God, because he laid down his life for us.” But “In this
<pb id="hols170" n="170"/>
was manifested the love of God toward us, because that
God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we
might live through him.” “For God so loved the world
that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever 
believeth in him, should not perish but have everlasting
life.” “He first loved us,” with that love that stirred
his heart and moved his arm of power. But man is a
sinner. He is wretched, vile and polluted, lost, ruined
and broken by the fall. An outcast alien under just
condemnation. A smiling heaven and a laughing paradise 
receded from his vision, since God, the gracious
Father, was offended. Epochs and dispensations rolled
on, chronicling the rise, growth and death of ages and
nations. Darker and blacker grew the mental and moral
night of the world, and as man multiplied sin did much
more abound. Now and then a meteor flashed across
the dark hemispheres, and here and there altars glowed
and priests officiated. The ages, old and gray, traveled
slowly down the declivities of time and space until the
dying Jacob heard the rumbling of Messiah's chariot
wheels, caught the whispers of his coming and the flash
of his eye. When he said, “I have waited for thy salvation, 
O Lord,” he spoke the sentiment of universal humanity. 
But the law must be given and the foundation of the
Jewish polity of types and shadows must be laid, and its
superstructure reared, and the blood of sprinkling must
antedate the blood of cleansing. Jehovah descended
from heaven in clouds and flaming fire. The trumpet's
awful blasts and the jarring appeals of thunder 
announce the awful presence of God in his kingly majesty.
Onward, in <sic corr="appalling">appaling</sic> grandeur descends his chariot of
flame. Louder, longer, and louder still, swells the high 
trump of God. Israel looks up and the heavens are dark 
with sable bands and thick clouds. Lightning sparkles 
in fantastic and vivid glare, and play upon the burning
waves of the air, as if the atmosphere in chaos trembled
<pb id="hols171" n="171"/>
under the mighty tread of Deity. The legislative God 
descends, the earth quakes and an empire of solid granite 
dances beneath his feet, while wreathing columns of 
smoke mingled with flame are the curtains of his sanctuary. 
The walls of the royal sanctuary were amber flames, 
fanned by the swift moving wings of mighty seraphs and 
great archangels, attending the royal presence. And so 
terrible was the sight that Moses said, “I exceedingly fear 
and quake.” “The law was given by Moses, but grace 
and truth came by Jesus Christ.” The law could not save.
Jesus alone can do that. He loved us first and pointed 
out his soul unto death. See him as he lays aside his 
crown, his kingly scepter, his robe, and the glory of 
heaven for you, for me, and for all the sinning race of 
Adam. O, come to Jesus and be saved. Why not? Hath 
he not loved you? Did he not give himself for you? O, 
ye sons of Adam, arise, stand up and flee the coming
wrath of God. O, praise his name, ye his saints!</p>

13:28.</p>
          </epigraph>
          <p>When we contemplate the history of man and view him 
in his physical, moral and spiritual relations and conditions, 
and then compare his nature and career with the dealings 
of Divine Providence and the requirements of Revelation, 
we must admit that there is “an enemy” strong and mighty, 
cosmopolitan, universal and profound in his operations, 
affecting every age, people, and individual. Whether 
we stem the tide of the rolling ages and ascend the 
stream of time, or take our stand upon some lofty 
eminence of the present dispensation, and view the whole
circle of earth's teeming humanity, the same verdict will be
reached by the impartial mind in regard to the existence 
and work of an enemy in human society. His name is 
carved on every brow, his hand hath touched every heart, 
his image is stamped on every soul, and his footprint is in 
every land, and his blood-curdling banner floats over every 
stream and on the rolling waves of every sea. All along 
through the ages, malevolence, destruction and the utter 
subversion of human happiness have characterized his
diabolical designs and distinguished his mighty operations. He 
it is who hath sowed tares among the wheat and corrupted 
the whole field of the moral spheres. Who can count the 
millions slain by him, or number the carcasses of the bleeding 
victims and the fallen tribes? What stream can contain 
the tears of the heart-broken and sorrow-stricken? Behold! 
men count the stars, number the planets, measure the sidereal 
heavens, traverse the wilderness, pierce the profundities
<pb id="hols173" n="173"/>
of earth's deep bosom and weigh the mountains in scales, 
but they fail to compute the misery of man and the number 
of the dead slain by our great foe. On a thousand 
battle-fields, in the political arena, in the palaces of great 
kings, in the revolutions and evolutions of human society, 
and on the broad fields of false religion, of investigation and 
discovery everywhere, the great foe is active, wise, astute, 
and sways the hearts and consciences of the nations. Let 
us beware of his artful hand, of his nimble power and 
widespread and all-permeating influence. Let us contemplate 
the great foe under the following divisions:
<list type="simple"><item><hi rend="italics">I. The origin and advent of the enemy.</hi></item><item><hi rend="italics">II. His nature and powers.</hi></item><item><hi rend="italics">III. The ends designed.</hi></item><item><hi rend="italics">IV. The agencies employed.</hi></item></list></p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">I. The origin and advent of the enemy;</hi> that is, of Satan 
or the devil. 1st. He is a <hi rend="italics">being,</hi> a living creature, because 
he was created by the Almighty. 2d. He was in heaven, 
in a state of bliss and happiness, but in a state of probation 
and trial, and consequently the perpetuation of his happiness 
was contingent upon his obedience to the divine 
command. 3d. Being in this state or condition, it was possible 
for him to sin, which he did, and thus he lost his place in 
heaven among the sons of the Most High, and by the 
Almighty power was cast down to hell, and with him legions 
of other mighty flaming spirits were cast out; for, says St. 
Peter, “God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast 
them down to hell and delivered them unto chains of darkness, 
to be reserved unto judgment.”—II Pet. 2:4. Jude 
makes substantially the same statement. The time of his 
fall and advent is not known, but the fact of both his advent 
and fall is a stern reality, demonstrated by all his dreadful 
and terrific acts and mighty doings upon the face of the 
earth.</p>
          <pb id="hols174" n="174"/>
          <p><hi rend="italics">II. His nature and power.</hi> 1. He is spirit, incapable of
decay and dissolution, of course. The Father of spirits
can dissolve and annihilate any and all organized beings,
whether they be men, angels, mighty spirits, or powers;
thrones, dominions, principalities, or all things in heaven,
earth and hell. But God's methods are otherwise ordained.
However, Apollyon's power is great—that is, his capacity
to do, to perform wonders, to execute mighty deeds.
Though fallen and cast down to hell and restricted to 
certain limits in the divine arrangements, yet to an astonishing 
degree he is still in the possession of mighty power.
Smitten by the omnific hand from the fair fields of the
paradise of God, hear him cry as he flies like a mighty
scintillating spark struck off from its native sun, as Milton
describes:
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“Farewell, happy fields, where joys forever dwell;</l><l>Hail horrors! Hail, Infernal world! and thou profoundest hell:</l><l>Receive thy new possessor; one who brings</l><l>A mind not to be changed by place or time.”</l></lg></q></p>
          <p>But he is a spirit, though he may be possessed with an
ethereal, corporeal frame, suited to the spirituality of his 
nature. He must be gigantic in stature, magnificent in 
person, and possessing much of his original comely 
proportions.</p>
          <p>The fact that he fell from his high estate does not 
necessarily imply that he lost all of the might of his strength 
and the glory of his power. Since he is the chief of devils, 
a leader of a mighty flock, and the governor of dethroned 
powers, dominions and principalities, it is fair to infer that 
he is possessed of many of those noble traits of character 
and appearances which distinguish him as a great leader 
among the millions of fallen spirits. Lifting his lofty crest 
in the councils and assemblies of the mighty in arms, he is
<pb id="hols175" n="175"/>
at once the center of attraction and action, and leader of
rebellious millions. His power, though limited and 
restricted within certain degrees, is yet very great. The
essential elements of durability, versatility, accompanied
with a capacious mind and varied accomplishments, makes
him a most remarkable and wonderful creature. It is true
there may be somewhere in the universe of God mighty
spirits more gigantic in form, more comely in symmetrical
proportions, possessing a higher range of knowledge and
greater powers of activity and alertness; yet we have not
been informed in regard to them. But we know Satan.
“We are not ignorant of his devices.” His history is written 
in the annals of the nations and upon the world's 
civilizations. He is great in power, mighty in strength, 
wonderful in knowledge, profound in wisdom, exhaustless in
the ability to plan and endowed with a marvelous capacity 
to execute the desires of his heart. He is a great scholar,
with ripe experience. He is acquainted with the history of
the nations, the sciences of the ages, the philosophies of the
schools and the great men of the world. His power of
locomotion and celerity of flight are most remarkable. The
Saviour says, “I beheld Satan fall from heaven like lightning.”
He walks up and down the earth, traverses the
zones and hemispheres, and plows the briny main, bent on
high-handed mischief, seeking his victims in every clime,
seeming to be almost ubiquitous. Let us watch the manœuverings 
of the great foe, the mendacious leader of hell, sin
and death.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">III. The ends designed.</hi> His aim is to defeat the glory 
of God in the happiness of man. And since the Almighty 
is Invulnerable and flanked about with infinite power, he 
knows that it is impossible to do Him harm. This would be 
a hopeless undertaking and incompatible with wisdom 
and the skilled tactics of a wise and sagacious leader.
<pb id="hols176" n="176"/>
Having no hope of success here, Satan turns his 
multiform machinations and operations against man, 
the intelligent creature of God. If happiness could 
dwell in his hell-stirred heart, he would enjoy the 
greatest proportion of happiness when he has rendered 
man the most miserable. The desire to render others miserable 
because he is miserable is the quintessence and climax 
of wickedness and diabolical abominations too intricate
for the human mind to conceive of. If such procedure 
would add one single item to his own well-being, or in any 
way lessen his sorrow and ease his pain, or if it were possible 
to gain anything thereby, there might be some palliating 
circumstances in the case. But there are none. Yet the natural 
proclivities of his wicked heart urge him on with 
uncontrollable momentum to do his black and cruel deeds of 
violence, crime and shame. His object is to rob God of 
his glory, man of his happiness, heaven of its wreathed 
victors, and populate hell with the slain millions. How 
cruel is our great foe! How obdurate and callous is 
his heart! How foul is his spirit! And how has he 
succeeded? Would you know? Go view his tracks from the 
Garden of Eden down the steep of ages. Go read his 
history of the peoples of all realms, of every clime, of 
every tongue. Go count the kingdoms broken, the empires 
destroyed. Go count the wars and battle-fields, and measure 
the tears and blood of the dead and dying. Go count 
the groans and sighings of the widow and orphan, the 
friendless, the naked and the poor. Go number the 
debauched hordes and superstitious ranks that crowd heathen 
temples and pay their homage to gods that are no gods. Go 
follow the blood-stained track of this great Moloch, crested
with fiery plume and direful hate, into the courtrooms, the
jails, penitentiaries, and gallowses. Go, traverse the burning 
track of hell, and number the black millions of the lost, and
<pb id="hols177" n="177"/>
then consider the eternity of their damnation and their 
banishment from the presence of the Lord and the glory 
of his power. Over these slain the heart shudders, the 
blood curdles, and trembling takes hold upon the frame. 
Oh, what hath this enemy done? Who, oh who, can 
compute the lost of these thousands of years of the long reign 
of sin and Satan?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">IV. The agencies employed.</hi> These are varied, extensive
and exhaustless. In his selections the fittest are chosen to
accomplish the ruin, the marvelous work of human
destruction and the subversion of every institution whose
aims and designs are to soften and ameliorate the conditions 
and rugged circumstances of suffering humanity. All
the instruments, ways and means of human happiness and
man's promotion from a lower to a higher state of morality,
religion and social refinement, are eagerly sought, and when
obtained, are polluted and diverted from their proper channels, 
and made to do what they were not designed to do.
Let us briefly note some of these. Diplomacy and war,
from the most remote ages, have been employed by the
great enemy of God and man to destroy the peace and
break the harmony of all the families, tribes and nations of
the earth. No instrument employed by him has done more
to hinder the progress and civilization of the world than
war. Goaded on by the powers of darkness and lead by
the prince of the aliens, it takes but a little to fire the public
heart and kindle the nations into strife and carnage that
cover the earth with blood and the broken bodies of the
slain and dying. Indeed, the world has often appeared as
one great battle-field, sinking billions of money, exhausting
the flower and strength of the people, bankrupting 
governments and destroying the resources of the public 
revenue. Ambition, the lust of power, the love of display
and wealth along with hatred. and malice have characterized
<pb id="hols178" n="178"/>
the great kings and conquerors of the nations. In 
diplomacy, what treachery, perfidy and deception! In war, 
what cruelties and human butchery have been displayed by 
the conquerors! When we see an Alexander, a Xerxes or 
a Napoleon making war on surrounding nations, apparently 
with no other object than to get gain and extend their 
power and slake their greed for human destruction, we must 
conclude that there is a power behind the agent that 
engages in such hideous deeds of death and horror. In their 
track of destruction, what a train of evils follow! Kings 
are dethroned, dynasties destroyed, states and kingdoms 
subverted and disintegrated, cities, towns, villages, hamlets 
and the rural plains filled with the broken ruins and the 
smoking débris of houses, mansions, palaces, forests; weeping 
widows, sighing orphans and those institutions of learning 
and science that have been put on foot to promote the 
happiness of man and lift him to a higher plane in the civil 
state, are overwhelmed in ruins. The ingenuity of man has 
been wrought up to its highest pitch to invent missiles and
diabolical machines for the wholesale murder and destruction 
of the humankind. What a black train of evils follows 
war! Society is upheaved, the wicked and the base are 
brought to prominence, and all the worst elements of 
depravity are put into active and lively play upon the stage of 
life. Famine, pestilence, disease, poverty, the stagnation 
of every branch of industry, and ten thousand other ills too 
numerous to mention follow. Surely “an enemy hath done 
this.”</p>
          <p>Learned, capacious minds have been perverted in the 
hands of this foe. “God hath made man upright; but they 
have sought out many inventions.” The human intellect
has often been prostituted to unholy and unsavory ends. 
It has been so darkened by the enemy, that they 
have put truth for falsehood, and falsehood for truth,
<pb id="hols179" n="179"/>
light for darkness and darkness for light. It has made
heaven hell, and hell heaven. One of the first things
done by the perverted learning of man is to seek
to disprove the truth, the authenticity, divine inspiration 
and originality of the Bible. At all hazard, and at any
cost, the unsanctified mind strives to uproot the oracles of
God and thus increase unbelief and destroy the devotees
of truth, religion, and virtue, and ruin the eternal well-being
of man. The God of nature is made to contradict the God of
the Bible. “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no
God.” False religion has always been a powerful instrument 
in the hands of Satan to blind and obscure the mental
vision, to corrupt the heart and to vitiate the moral and
social tastes of mankind. Half truths are the most insinuating 
and deceptive form of falsehoods. A little truth mixed
in with a great deal of error is more palatable to the
vile and sinful heart of man. To establish a falsehood,
therefore, there must be put into the otherwise untoothsome 
bait some truth. Hence all false religions are
a mixture of truth and untruth, and the shades of light and
darkness, of life and death, of hell and heaven are so
blended that the unpracticed mind and heart unhesitatingly
take in the deadly venom. All false religions, therefore,
are the counterfeit pieces of one great and only true 
religion—Christianity. Nowhere in the history of sin has
Satan succeeded more admirably and universally than here.
Here, in error's chains the millions of blind and deaf 
votaries soundly sleep and have slept for ages. Here is the
smooth road and the wide gateway of death.</p>
          <p>Song, the music of the soul, and the melody of heaven 
has been perverted and used to rally the forces of hell and 
inflame the basest passions of wicked men, and stimulate 
the blind votaries of superstition and diabolical intrigue. 
On her swift pinions of gold she has been the herald, the
<pb id="hols180" n="180"/>
grand messenger to waft the mandates of hell around the 
globe into all the nooks and corners of human society. 
The flute, the harp, the bagpipe, the horn, the trumpet, 
the pianoforte, the soft notes of the organ and the trained 
voice have for many an age made up the minstrelsy of hell. 
Man will sing, though he sing going hellward. Oh, stop! 
hush the loud mouth of the bacchanalian!</p>
          <p>Learning, money, influence, precious gems, eloquence 
and poetry, all have been pressed into the service of Satan 
and the cause of hell. Master minds, towering and great 
with their marvelous productions, have worshipped at the 
shrine of the great deceiver and done homage to the prince 
of darkness. Millions of money is poured at the base of 
his throne, and his exchequer is filled with heaps of gold, 
and yet he clamors for more. The pillars of his temple are 
embossed with the gems of earth's kingdoms. The lavished 
influence of the mighty and noble force the weak and ignoble 
to follow in their mad dash for death and hell.</p>
          <p>But is Satan always thus to reign and triumph over the 
earth and tyrannize over the sons of men? God forbid. 
“The kingdom is the Lord's.” It belongs to Jesus Christ. 
It is His by right of His death and sufferings, by His 
agonies on the cross, by his blood and tears, his groaning 
and shame, and the multitude of sorrows which He 
bore for you and me, and for all the dead and living sons of 
Adam and daughters of Eve. The enemy is great 
but Christ is greater. He is the “Prince of the kings of the
earth,” “the bright and morning star,” and “the Alpha and 
Omega.” “Oh, that men would praise the Lord for his 
goodness, and for His wonderful works to the children of 
men.” Oh, that he may come, “whose right it is” to reign
forever and ever. Amen!</p>

          <head>Holiness and Peace.</head>
          <epigraph>
            <p>“Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no men 
shall see the Lord.”—Heb. 12:14.</p>
          </epigraph>
          <p>Every system of morals and ethical science presented to 
the judgment and consideration of men has its supposed 
or real central truths. It matters not whether the doctrines 
taught be true or false, good or evil, they come, resting 
their claims upon pillars of brass, blocks of marble, or banks 
of sand. But it may be asserted, without the fear of 
contradiction, that every system of religion, philosophy, or 
science is best known by the effects it has produced upon 
society and those followers and devotees who obey the 
mandates and precepts of such a system of doctrines and teachings. 
This is the rule laid down by our Saviour when He 
says, “Ye shall know them by their fruits.” As a good tree 
cannot bring forth evil fruit, so a good system of religion 
or philosophy cannot produce evil converts and a corrupt 
or pestilential progeny, since the religious faith, views and 
practices make up the moral life of peoples and individuals.
A man's theory of morals and religion may be right or 
wrong, and in results may be destructive to the best 
ends of society, yet he will follow the theory upon 
which his faith is founded. So deeply seated are the 
religious faculties and proclivities in human nature that they 
demand not only faith and belief, but demand that in their 
essentials they should be correct and true within themselves. 
If we look into the history of the past ages, and scan the 
religions that have existed and contemplate their forms and 
aspects, we shall find that their theories and practices went 
hand in hand, and the development of the religious life
<pb id="hols182" n="182"/>
was a recapitulation or reproduction in tangible form of 
their faiths and beliefs.</p>
          <p>The Gospel of Jesus Christ is a system of revealed 
religion, presented to us with claims of divine authority and 
divine originality. It matters very little as to the mere 
authenticity of the divine Revelation, for a thing may be 
true, and yet not authentic. As to the essentials of 
Christianity, it matters not who wrote or compiled the 
Pentateuch, or who wrote the book of Job or the books of the 
New Testament; but it is a matter of infinite concern 
whether the essentials taught therein are true or false, right 
or wrong, since the life and character of men and nations 
are to be shaped and governed according to the doctrines 
and commands therein revealed. On the other hand, if 
men can shape and form and even reform the essentials of 
the religion they profess, it shows the falsity and insufficiency 
of the system to meet the eternal and substantial 
needs and aspirations of men. No man or set of men, nor 
school of science, nor of philosophy, no matter how wise, 
ancient and venerable they may be, has the right or capacity 
to make a religion and present its claims to men. They 
could have no authority nor power to dictate the faith 
and consciences of men. And even if they could go that 
far, yet their systems would fall short of that high and 
awful sanctity that God has bestowed upon the divine 
revelation found in the Scriptures of truth.</p>
          <p>As the Gospel of Jesus Christ is a system of divine truth 
and morals, instituted and revealed to man by the infinite 
Deity as a standard of faith and conduct, so it has its 
fundamental and essential truths and principles. As such 
it comes to enlighten, cheer, strengthen and guide the
judgment and tastes of men and nations, and to lift up,
sanctify and save. As the sun is the essential force of light 
and heat in the planetary system, so Jesus Christ, shining
<pb id="hols183" n="183"/>
in and through the gospel system, is the essential element 
of force, light and heat by whose bright rays and shining 
gems of truth and power the whole race of man is stirred 
and stimulated to seek that life and salvation which He 
came to make manifest to all the children of men. But, 
says the text: “Follow peace with all men, and holiness, 
without which no man shall see the Lord.” For 
convenience we invert the text.</p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item>

            <item>

            </item>
          </list>
          <p>“The holiness” here spoken of as an essential of the 
Christian life, “without which no man shall see the Lord,” 
is that moral purity that is absolutely and indispensably 
requisite for the redemption and salvation of every man. 
It is that high and holy state of moral purity and sanctification 
that every man, woman and child, and all the intelligences 
of the universe must possess, before they can reach 
or obtain that happiness and peace that make up the present 
or the future state of bliss. It is <hi rend="italics">the sanctification.</hi> The
sublime, unique and eminent truth, lifting its lofty cone,
as Mount Everest, high and alone, towers in gigantic
form and heavenly majesty up above the clouds and storm-line 
in the serene and clear atmosphere of a happy realization
of its spiritual power and vital force. The new translation
has it, “Follow peace with all men, and <hi rend="italics">the sanctification.</hi>”
“The sanctification” is the great act in the redemptive
process, because moral purity is the only ground upon which
it is possible for men ultimately to be saved. A
pure life, a pure heart, a thorough consecration of one's
self to God and his service, as well as a purification of the
heart and soul, must be obtained. Hence sanctification is
not a process like the growth of a tree or plant, neither is it
the collection or congregating of those accretions of decent
acts and amenities that give the life a consistent and an
<pb id="hols184" n="184"/>
agreeable appearance. But it is the deeper work of the
Spirit of God in cleansing of the Adamic soul, or the 
cleansing of that nature that is imputed, and really 
given to us because of our descent from Adam, our sinful 
father, and Eve, our sinful mother. We cannot grow 
into holiness any more than we can grow into regeneration. 
Both are acts in the redeeming process, but acts that none 
can perform but the Holy Spirit. Regeneration or justification 
is the work that God does for us, but sanctification is 
the work done <hi rend="italics">in</hi> us. The former is the pardon of sins, the 
latter is the washing out the inbred or Adamic sins. When 
God pardoned us of sin, he did not pardon us of Adam's
sins, or that sinful nature which we have received from him 
as his children, but God <hi rend="italics">did</hi> pardon us of <hi rend="italics">our own sins,</hi>
those sins which we have committed against His law and 
against His revealed Word. As to the acts of justification 
and sanctification, they follow each other as the acts of a 
judge upon the bench follow the justifying of a prisoner 
who, having been indicted for crime, was cast into prison by 
the public authorities. But when the judge pronounced the 
sentence of “not guilty,” that is justification. This is one 
act. When the sheriff opens the prison doors, takes off the 
chains and shackles, and lets the prisoner out, this is analogically 
sanctification. The prisoner is, therefore, <hi rend="italics">free.</hi> He 
is not only pardoned, or justified, but <hi rend="italics">free.</hi> Free from 
natural, inbred or Adamic sin.</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“He breaks the power of <hi rend="italics">cancelled</hi> sin, </l>
            <l>He sets the prisoner <hi rend="italics">free;</hi></l>
            <l>His blood can make the foulest <hi rend="italics">clean; </hi></l>
            <l>His blood availed for <hi rend="italics">me.”</hi></l>
          </lg>
          <p>Thus far the great majority of Methodists are agreed 
upon this fundamental doctrine of the Bible. But, as to
the time between the acts in the process of redemption,
<pb id="hols185" n="185"/>
there is a great controversy and constant agitation. Some 
believe a man is both pardoned and justified in the same act, 
place and time, while others believe that after justification, 
the act of cleansing, or purifying, must take place; that in 
the act of justification there was no cleansing or purifying, 
and therefore, the cleansing, purifying, or the act of 
sanctification, must be sought after justification. But it 
seems to me that the truth lies between the two extremes. 
A man that is converted to-day, or justified, may be sanctified 
in the next hour, the next day or next year, and, therefore, 
sanctification is to be sought as we sought regeneration 
or justification; for he may be justified and not have a 
perfect and distinct knowledge of it. No man knows that 
his sins are pardoned until the Spirit “bears witness with 
his spirit that he is a child of God.” The knowledge of our 
acceptance with God can only reach us by His Spirit 
informing us that we are sanctified, and, therefore, pardoned. 
Why do I say this? Because the Holy Spirit of God will 
not come into the heart or soul when it is unclean or 
unsanctified. I am not so anxious to prove the method of 
procedure in the redemptive process as to prove the fact and 
philosophy of the case, as it is taught in the Bible. We 
want to know the Word and will of God, so that we may do 
his will and conform to the requirements of the divine 
commands.</p>
          <p>We might take up the subject and treat philosophically, 
or from a metaphysical standpoint prove the truth of the 
Bible doctrine that “without holiness no man shall see the 
Lord,” or enjoy that perfect love and reconciliation with 
Him and in His holy and divine presence that are the only 
inherent and fundamentals of happiness. What is demanded 
of men in respect to moral purity is also demanded of 
angels and all spiritualities of the universe. The conflict 
of elements and the war of forces are <sic>inharmony,</sic> and
<pb id="hols186" n="186"/>
however that strife or inharmony may come, and no 
matter whatever else an intelligent being may have, or 
whatever may be his exalted station in the degree and 
dignity of being, we cannot see how he can be happy or enjoy
God unless he is in harmony with the great “I Am.” Hence, 
holiness, or that moral purity that God demands, is the only
ground of harmony, of happiness, and of heaven. There is 
no place in the universal dominion of being for the unholy, 
the impure and the unsanctified heart or soul to be happy, 
neither in this present state of being nor in that which is to 
come. The wicked and polluted soul could pot be happy, 
even in heaven; for he would be without those principles 
and elements of character that are indispensable for his 
peace and the enjoyment of those pure, holy, and thronging 
millions that compose the company of heaven, who 
came “through great tribulations,” and had “washed their 
robes, and made them white (pure) in the blood of the 
Lamb.” We believe that it is possible, and in many cases 
a fact, that thousands are sanctified without ever having
sought for it or having any knowledge of it, since we 
must suppose that many ignorant and illiterate people are 
truly Christians, lived and died as such, and went home to 
heaven. There are thousands to-day, as of all past time, 
who are incapable, and who have neither time nor 
opportunity of understanding fully the essentials of Christianity, 
yet they love God, love their neighbors, belong to the 
church and are willing, obedient servants of the Most 
High. They have a vivid experience, if not a perfect 
knowledge of their conversion; they well remember the 
struggles, groanings, sorrowings under the heavy load of 
sin; they well remember the day and place when and where 
they felt their hearts changed, and their feet plucked out of 
the mire and the clay and a new song put into their mouths, 
even praises unto God; but they know nothing of the special
<pb id="hols187" n="187"/>
and specific work of the cleansing, or the act of sanctification.
They are the children of God as much as the 
theologian who, because of his calling and superior 
advantages, understands many of the deep and intricate things 
of God and the religion of Jesus. Shall we say that these 
poor, ignorant and uncultured children of God are not 
saved to the uttermost, because they were unlearned and 
untutored in the philosophy and fundamentals of 
<sic corr="Christianity?">Chistianity?</sic> No, not all. But since they must be holy before 
they can enter heaven and enjoy God, they must have been 
sanctified and made pure, as well as pardoned somewhere 
and at some time, between the natural birth and the moment 
of entering the paradise of God. But you say God winks 
at ignorance, and that when we have the opportunity to
seek sanctification and fail to do it, He will hold us 
responsible for it, and, therefore, we should seek it. That 
is true. Every word of it is to the spirit and letter of God's
commands; but that does not alter or change the fact that 
many are sanctified without their having any specific knowledge 
of either seeking it or having obtained it; yet they 
have it, because they show all the fruits of the Spirit, and 
gain heaven in the end. The predominant idea of holiness, 
or moral <hi rend="italics">cleanness</hi> is that it fits us for the awful presence 
of the Infinite Deity. It is the clean clothes, the pure and 
“bright raiment” “without spot or wrinkle,” that fits all 
comers to the heavenly tabernacle to enter and to be
entertained by Jesus Christ, who is “the Prince of the kings 
of the earth,” and “the bright and morning star.” What 
elaborate preparations are made by the great men of earth 
to meet their kings, emperors and crowned heads! What 
studied programs, magnificent pageantry and splendid 
equipages to meet their earthly masters and human leaders! 
These are men of state, governors, lawyers, doctors, 
judges, clothed in the bright ermine of their office, senators,
<pb id="hols188" n="188"/>
representatives, and statesmen; laborers from field 
and forest, artisans from shop and forge, the painters 
from the studios of art, women and children and old 
men bent under the toils of life and the weight of years; 
philosophers, scientists, mathematicians and metaphysicians, 
old and gray with struggling thought, whose souls aflame 
have “walked the solar paths” and driven their chariots of 
silken sunbeams over the high domes of the “Milky Way” 
hard to the universal center. All, all, come to meet their
earthly lord and reigning king, and amid booming cannon, 
and stately cordons of national armies men stand in awful 
silence, with bated breath and uncovered heads. The king 
is passing by.</p>
          <p>But what is this compared to the infinite and high 
presence of the King immortal? How weak and 
insignificant is this earthly grandeur and majestic 
display of a nation compared with the greatness of the majesty 
of the court of heaven? If an earthly monarch 
demands such high and respectful allegiance from his 
subjects as to awaken the keenest interest and profoundest
attention, how is the interest and attention heightened 
when our moral and mental manhood shall stand in the 
awful presence of the Infinite Creator, before whose 
all-discerning eye every heart is open, and all the inner 
consciousness is discovered in its multiform and intricate 
actions, relations and conditions! But a clean heart and a 
pure, blood-washed soul can tread the holy courts of God 
and dwell in His high, holy and majestic presence.</p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="italics">II. What is implied in peace?</hi>
          </p>
          <p>As holiness is the fundamental and the cardinal principle 
of reconciliation between God and man, so peace is the 
product or resultant factor in the redemptive scheme. It 
ushers in that period and brings us into that relationship 
with God where there is perfect harmony, and that parental
<pb id="hols189" n="189"/>
relation that is more real, more splendid and beautiful
than that of the tender babe and the loving mother. It is
the deep and abiding consciousness that there is nothing
between God and ourselves but an unclouded vista,
wreathed with flowers all fragrant with His love and replete
with the bright and beaming sunshine of His face, filling
the soul with the radiance of heaven and the music of the
angels. This is personal peace, spoken of by the Saviour,
when He said, “My peace I give unto you, not as the world
giveth”—a peace that ramifies the soul, filling all its
chambers and deep recesses with an unearthly calm and
heavenly assurance that belongs only to the true children of
God. Whoever has this peace is a child of God; for none
can have such a priceless jewel but the true children of the
Most High. But as there was a struggle before personal
peace came, so there must be a struggle and a conflict of
forces before national, international and world-wide peace
shall fully prevail on the earth. There must be a 
conflict of opposite and diverse elements, agencies of spiritual,
mental, civil, social or economic forces. Christ came
to stir, agitate, and set in active operation all the attributes,
natures, things, principles, and powers that pertain to all
the great concerns of the glory of God in human redemption. 
For he says, “Suppose ye that I am come to give
peace on earth? I tell you, nay; but rather division.”
Again, “I am come to send fire on the earth; and what
will I, if it be already kindled?” Again, “There is no peace
to the wicked saith my God.” That is, there can be no 
compromise between good and evil, between the forces of 
Christianity and the forces of sin and the Devil. There must
be a struggle, a long and dreadful conflict for the mastery
and control of human hearts, human governments, and
all the spiritual, moral and mental empire of the children 
of men. And this struggle for the mastery, in the
<pb id="hols190" n="190"/>
very nature of the case, is necessary and indispensable. It 
is a natural consequence of the long and dreadful reign 
of sin. It is the irrepressible conflict of the centuries, that 
cannot cease its fearful hostilities until peace is declared in 
favor of that just and holy administration which Jesus 
Christ came to establish. This universal peace cannot be 
established until the Word of God shall have been preached 
in all the earth; until all the vile and depraved and black 
squadrons of sin and hell shall have been overthrown, and 
the beautiful and majestic reign of Messiah shall cover 
every land and sea, and sit enthroned in every heart, and 
in every tribe and nation; “for He must reign until He 
hath put all enemies under His feet.” But how? “Not by 
might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord.” 
Not by the might of nations, nor the concentration of 
armies, or stringent laws, nor yet by national and 
international treaties; not by fire, war and blood, nor the 
arbitrament of the sword, but by the preaching of the Gospel, 
the conversion of sinners, and the Spirit of God permeating, 
reforming and sanctifying human hearts and consecrating 
the mental faculties of intelligent humanity to His 
service and His love. These may be deemed the spiritual 
energies and those deep and silent forces that act beneath the 
surface of society and human tastes and agencies. But as 
man has a tangible existence as well as an intangible 
reality, the physical and mental forces and powers must 
coöperate in the redemption of universal humanity. Not 
only will the people of God coöperate with His Spirit with 
this end in view, but the widespread physicalities of nature, 
under the control of inter-racial and international barter 
and trade, are to be the able, although not efficient, agencies 
under real and sentimental Christianity. But the relations 
of nations, with the interchange of thought, learning, and 
all the powers of increasing civilization, are to be 
<pb id="hols191" n="191"/>
swift-running couriers to bear to distant lands the glory of His
kingdom, the greatness of His truth, the sweetness and
melodies of his name.</p>
          <p>Let us remember that “the earth is the Lord's and the 
fullness thereof,” and that we are looking for “a new heaven 
and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” “Let not 
your hearts troubled, ye believe in God, believe also in
me.”</p>
          <p>O, ye saints of God, look up, He is coming, he is coming 
to do justice and judgment in the earth. Hell is great, 
but Christ is greater. Behold, he cometh skipping over the 
hills and mountains of broken decades, dying years and 
dead centuries. Before Him the dead and stupid gods of 
the nations are falling and the empire of sin upon its 
ancient base is trembling and rocking. I see Him rising 
above the surging waves of space and time and ascending 
the horizon in His chariot of flame, with the greatness 
and the indescribable majesty of His kingdom 
following in his train. I see men, women and children, with
harps and cymbals, drums and golden lutes, and all stringed
instruments of music playing with nimble fingers, and 
singing the great doxology of triumph. “The Lord God 
omnipotent reigneth.”</p>

          <head>The Unity of Christianity.</head>
          <epigraph>
            <p>“Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours.”—
I Cor. 3:21.</p>
          </epigraph>
          <p>In the second chapter of this epistle the apostle begins it
by saying, “And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not
with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you
the testimony of God,” etc. Again, he speaks of the wisdom 
of this world as being “foolishness with God, for it is
written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness,” etc.
But let it be understood that neither God nor his inspired
apostle designed to discourage the culture of the brain nor
the pursuit of knowledge or wisdom. But the apostle 
designs to show the folly, the uncertainty, and the mental
darkness under which the ancient schools of science and
philosophy labored; and that because of human weakness,
and mental depravity, the learning and product of Grecian
philosophy then prevalent, could never solve those religious
and profound questions that have, in a greater or less 
degree, stirred and agitated universal humanity. In this
sense, “the wisdom of this world,” or the old system of 
Grecian dogma and philosophy, “is foolishness with God.”
On the other hand, God designs and religion comes not to
make men fools or less wise, but it is sent from God to man
to enlarge his sphere of knowledge, quicken the mental
faculties, clear with the bright sun of righteousness the
moral atmosphere, making mankind “wise unto salvation.”
Indeed, among the forces and agencies of God which he
has put into operation on the human plane, none is
more essential, befitting and resplendent with the redemptive
<pb id="hols193" n="193"/>
elements than the mental faculties. Knowledge is an
essential element in human salvation, as much as it is an 
essential element in human progress and the world's 
civilization. Christianity comes to expand and extend the 
moral, mental, and physical horizon, to lift the mists and 
clouds, giving to the honest and true believer an <sic corr="untrammeled">untrammelled</sic> 
highway and an unshaded view in the deep vistas 
beyond. “This is life eternal, that they might know thee, 
the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” 
Knowledge is given us to know the right, to comprehend
the majestic, and to fathom the ways of God, that we may 
praise and adore him. Indeed, the universe is his grand 
temple, the court of his justice, the field of his power, 
and the gilded empire of his glory. Far, far beyond blazing 
suns, shining orbs and trembling systems, he rides the 
winged flame, treads their burning currents, buckles the 
systems to his belt, wreathes his brow with stars, and 
chains the sisters of the Milky Way to his feet, and bids 
them do his will. Also, “he maketh his angels spirits and his 
ministers a flame of fire.” Spirits are his servants, and 
angels are his messengers. Around him they stand as if 
hung on threads of silver, play through all parts of the 
universal mechanism as sunbeams play on the face of the 
earth. At his command they ramify his wide domains, 
sweep the studded chambers of the vaulted dome, and chain 
the swift-running lightnings to their native spheres. 
Around him, the universal Center, systems play and cast 
their shivered crafts, and flying boulders, and splintered
worlds at his feet, and in awful chaos praise the eternal 
thunderer “that bids them roll.” “Oh, the depth of the 
riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How 
unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding 
out!” But, says the apostle, “All things are yours; whether 
Paul, or <sic corr="Apollos">Apolos</sic>, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or
<pb id="hols194" n="194"/>
death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours, 
and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's.” That is, the 
church with its living ministry, its divine oracles of truth, 
or all the forces, elements, and agencies of organized and 
unified Christianity, with the physical and civil creations 
belong to you. They are all your servants and your friends 
to bring you to God, and perfect your manhood, advance 
your happiness and give you heaven in the end, while they 
give humanity glorious perpetuity and resplendent activity 
throughout the ages to come.</p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="italics">1. The unity of Christianity.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>Nothing proves the divine originality of Christianity
and the authenticity of its cardinal doctrines more than its
unity and perfect harmony with itself and with the ends
and aims that it has in view. All through the ages, and all
through the nations and the world's greatest civilizations,
religion has been the universal and most prominent factor in
the tastes, feelings and aspirations of men. The political, 
national and social forms that have obtained in human progress 
and developments have circled around its standard of
morals, and received their force and propulsion from the
germ seeds and grains of truth that have been evolved or
brought from the great mine of the world's great religions.
Though often mixed with error and covered by the dust of
ages, though its symbolisms and external faculties have
been perverted, prostituted and made to reach unholy ends,
yet these religions carry with them some grains of truth,
and in their fundamentals, when properly interpreted,
point to God as the great Author and Founder of their 
central truths and vital principles. They show a unification of
nature, intent, and purpose that make up a consistency and
harmony in their respective parts which declare themselves
to be of the one God. “Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is
one Lord,” and so it might be said, “Hear, all ye religions
<pb id="hols195" n="195"/>
of the nations and ages, the Lord thy God is one God and 
one Father.” From him all truth must come, since he is 
“the only true God,” and the only One in the universe that 
can dictate to the will and conscience and moral and 
religious proclivities of men and angels, and whatever other 
intelligences may reside in his dominions. All truth is 
from God, and must lead to God. Every thread and line 
and living cable that ramifies and thrills the living entities, 
though sometimes hidden and broken and covered 
with the débris and scoria of the wear and tear of the 
centuries, will take us back to God, the great Original, chaining 
all to the rock-ribbed mountains of the eternal shore. If 
there were ten thousand religions, and ten times ten thousand 
forms of worship, to be true and beneficial to mankind, 
they must all point to God and own him as the true and 
only proper and rightful object of prayer, praise and adoration. 
“All things are yours,” to lead you to God and plant 
you on the solid rock of truth and the eternal shore.</p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="italics">2. As there is a unity in Christianity, there must be a 
unity in the government of God.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>As there is but one God, there can be but one universal
government, founded upon principles of oneness, uniformity 
and justice. The eternal form of government is nothing 
compared to its principles, those fundamentals upon which 
the kingdom may rest. God's Government is always right, 
and just, and uniform. In the simple ground-principles 
upon which it rests, and by which it is perpetuated, there is 
a complete, full, and perfect conformity. It is a system of 
universal harmonies, so full and replete with its own 
Creator, that no true government can exist except the 
government of God. Human governments, because of 
their weakness, depravity and sins, are not true governments,
but are merely legalized mobs and perversions of the 
great original—the government of God. As religion 
<pb id="hols196" n="196"/>
becomes corrupt by the additions of men, so human governments
become corrupt by a departure from moral rectitude 
and the administration of justice. There should be no 
difference between the government of God and the government 
of men, except in degrees. But in nature and kind 
both should be the same, and steadily maintain the same 
ends in view, namely, the happiness of the governed. Now, 
the government of man is an image or a reflection of the 
kingdom of God. He is the great ideal, the <hi rend="italics">ne plus ultra</hi> 
of mental, moral, and physical conception. He, with his 
government, is the highest standard of excellence. No 
thought, act, being, form, or conception, can go beyond 
him. He dwells in the loftiest altitudes and the 
sublimest wonders of the possibilities of being. Manhood is 
a struggling image of the infinite and triumphant God, and 
perpetual struggle is the price of eternal life. We reach the 
immortal fixedness by labor, toil, and the fierce ordeal of 
death.</p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="italics">3. But the government of God is dictatorial, ministerial,
executive.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>He dictates, he sends forth his ministers and agencies, 
and by them he fulfills his will in the armies of heaven, earth 
and the myriads of the deep. He dictates to all the elements, 
forces, agencies, and the incomprehensible majesties, both 
material and immaterial. His will is the law of being and 
his commands are the immovable statutes of their mode and 
motions. Whether they roll, rest, or soar; whether they 
sing, hiss, or sigh—they are his servants and trembling 
ministers, bent on their eternal rounds to bring to their noble 
and glorious ends the great designs of his love and power. 
Every angel in heaven, every man on earth, and all the
devils, lost men and fallen spirits in hell, are his ministers, 
and in some mysterious way fulfill his high behests and his
wise commands. Men may rebel, infidels, sceptics and scoffers
<pb id="hols197" n="197"/>
may swear and oppose the truth, and hate the kingdom 
of God; they may make war on the Bible, persecute the 
saints, and seek to destroy the whole of the united forces of 
Christianity and subvert its organized forms; yet their madness
and rage can only intensify the friends of the truth, 
unite the armies of God, and solidify a nascent and an 
advancing Christianity. The will and purposes of God cannot 
be defeated, nor fail to reach the ends which his wisdom, 
love and goodness have proposed. Hence the government 
of God is dictatorial, ministerial, and executive.</p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="italics">4. We are in the presence of some great agency, power, 
or personality.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>We are in the <sic corr="presence">presenc</sic> of an influence and an expanding
energy, that are stirring, agitating and moving the forces 
and elements of nature as never before in the history of the 
world. The nations are all aglow with the ardent flame 
of progress, development, and expansion. This age is the 
culmination of ages. The concentration of centuries is 
shaping and fashioning universal manhood into a total 
unity of a personification that is wonderful and unique. 
This great agency is Christianity, this power is God, and 
this great personality is Jesus Christ. This triune 
character or trinity of forces is drawing “all things” toward the 
center, to a social, civil, political, commercial and 
interracial manhood, whose empire of brotherhood must and will
rule over all. Indeed, we are living in an age of blending
interests, when the great capitals of the world are getting 
nearer and nearer, and by reason of rapid transit and the 
quick transmission of thought, time is blotted out and space 
is annihilated. New York, London, Paris, Berlin, St. 
Petersburg, Pekin, and Canton, the great commercial 
centers, speak to each other daily and on hidden cables of elastic 
steel. The lightnings vibrate the sympathies and feelings 
of the nations, as if universal humanity were hung
<pb id="hols198" n="198"/>
on one solid nerve cord, or as if there was but one 
great heart of the world of man. Racial prejudices<corr sic="(no punctuation)">,</corr>
national hate, tribal distinctions, together with all 
frivolous conventionalities, must yield to the martial steps and 
massive tread of a newer and better civilization, quickened 
and made resplendent by an active and reformative Christianity.</p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="italics">5. “All things are yours,” to make you a man.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>Men are not made in a day, nor a year, nor a dozen of
years. It takes nearly a half of a century to make a man.
His physical constitution matures in less time, but the real
man, the true, hidden man, is made by slow process and by
degrees. As the skilled mechanic frets and belabors a piece
of pig iron into a useful and beautiful instrument, or as he
makes all the parts of a steam engine or some other
mechanism with its delicate and intricate parts, wheels,
cylinders, springs, axles, cogs, pulleys, bands, steamchests
and piston-rods, and as they are properly adjusted, each
working in perfect harmony with all other parts, so all the
faculties of humanity must be fretted, belabored and 
cultured, until the full, matured and perfect man comes from
the hands of the master. It is true, man is finished in the
fact of his being. He is finished in the nature and number
of the mental, moral, and physical faculties. Nothing new
in kind can be added to his being in this or in another state. 
He cannot have two memories, two or more judgments, or 
have a duality or multiplicity of moral ideals. Neither can 
he have comprehension or perceptions differing from those
that he now has, because this would be to change his being,
divert him from his original channel, and throw him out of 
himself where he becomes another or a different self. If 
such were possible with the nature and state of a personal,
conscious being, moral responsibility would be impossible, 
and the rebellious and intelligent would escape punishment,
<pb id="hols199" n="199"/>
and the righteous lose their reward. As, also, the justice of 
God would be a more sham, the ends of his government 
would be defeated, moral order subverted, and his kingdom 
which should rule “over all,” a failure. No, the complex 
mechanism of humanity was completed in the number of 
its faculties and essential elements in the first fiat act of 
his creation. Hence, no property, faculty, attribute, or 
fundamental can be added to his being. Again, he is made 
in the image of God. His mental and moral manhood 
is like its great Creator—spiritual, ethical, fixed in its statutes, 
and dwelling in altitudes and on a plane above all 
other things and powers that may produce death or bring 
decay. Hence man, as are all intelligent creatures, is 
naturally and constitutionally immortal and imperishable. 
What, then, is culture? Culture is the enlarging and 
expanding of those faculties and powers already given. It is 
development and the bringing out and putting into useful 
activity all that mental manhood that we call <hi rend="italics">mind.</hi> The 
advancements and improvements of the intellect are not 
the attachments of new essentials or fundamentals achieved 
by culture, but they are old powers and latent forces put
into activity. The intellect, then, is capable of perpetual 
and indefinite improvements and advancements. Step by 
step, evolution after evolution, the mental humanity 
ascends the rounds of the ladder of development, gaining in 
experience and self-force, until in the galaxy of its own 
perfect nature and purer light of God, all the powers and 
faculties will be in perfect balance and in full and endless 
harmony with all of its self and with its perfect ideal—
God.</p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="italics">6. But “all things are yours,” to bring you to a better
and higher self.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>The world was made for man and God. The Garden of 
Eden was made for Adam and his sons, and for Eve and
<pb id="hols200" n="200"/>
her daughters. The universe was made for the temple of 
God, and a house and dwelling-place for all his children. 
The vaulted dome, bedecked with gems and cities of stars 
with the countless “hosts of heaven” that make up “the 
shining frame,” were made for you. They were made to 
lift your aspirations, inspire your hope, nerve your effort. 
The rainbow bends over you, and spans the cerulean arch 
to give you patience and hope, and the lightnings flash to 
quicken your steps and clear the physical and moral 
atmosphere of the pestiferous seeds of sickness and death. 
The thunders remind you of the presence of the awful
God, great Jehovah who makes “the clouds his chariot” 
and the winds his horses. The thunderbolts are his 
winged arrows from his bow of fire, and his grape and 
canister from the pent-up magazines of the skies. The 
dewdrops are gems of blessings and silver crown of glory 
set in heavenly trim upon leaf, bud, petal and ripening 
fruit to remind us of the crowns of heaven. Seed time 
and harvest, spring and summer, the alternating seasons 
with their refreshing changes, are all yours. The sun 
shines to warm you and give you light, the winds blow 
to waft you on to God and make you a perfect man 
and a perfect woman; the seas roll, and rivers play on their 
rocky beds, and like cables of gold, tie the mountains to the 
seashore, that you may know there is an eternal anchorage 
hard by the throne of God and held by his hand. For you 
the stars revolve, comets flash and meteors fly in the open 
skies. “All things are yours.” Deep in the bowels of the 
earth there are mines of richest ores and living veins of 
gold and silver. There are beds of jewels, sleeping 
diamonds, and undiscovered urns of brightest gems to 
crown our queens in brilliant stars, and bedeck the royal
insignia of our kings with the beauties and studded grace 
of angels. There are magazines of oil, empires of iron,
<pb id="hols201" n="201"/>
and kingdoms of coal to keep us warm in winter, cook our
food, move our machinery, turn our wheels and spindles,
propel the mighty iron-clad monsters and “swift-running
greyhounds” across the surging seas, that we may speak to
our sisters and brothers of the islands and continents. There
are mountains of stone, with giant bones of granite and
massive ledges of unpolished marble to cover our streets,
build our houses and temples of honor, and halls of pleasure. 
At the voice of the thunder and the flashing of the
lightning, the melting clouds pace along the skies on the
chariot wheels of the wind and play upon the heaving
bosom of the air, as if they were the fleecy cars of heaven,
drawn by troops of angels, that there may be seed to the
sower and bread to the eater. The whole kingdom of 
nature, with its scenes of beauty and charming embodiments
of delight, with its robes of living green, and crowns of
brilliant flowers, blushing lilies, and bursting petals of
fragrant roses, is for you and for me, to help us on to God,
and to the sublime heights of a better, even a perfect self.
All the listening elements, the faculties and sleeping 
propensities of the universal spheres, with their countless
billions of molecular entities and atomical relations, unite
their forces and combine their energies to make a sinless
man, a sinless humanity. Every thread and fibre, every
string and wire, every cord and cable, and every golden
nerve and silver strand, and all the wheels of the universal
mechanism, are our willing servants and God-driven steeds
to land us all in heaven and crown us with immortal green
and the blushes of eternal youth. Civilization, with its forms,
relations, institutions, achievements, and discoveries, is
made for you and all the sons of men. Its flourishing cities,
its moving millions, its laws and customs, its codes of 
wisdom, books of learning and folios of experience with the
arts and sciences, are the beacon lights and polar stars to
<pb id="hols202" n="202"/>
catch the radiance of the Sun of righteousness and scatter 
its warmth and sparkling beams to the utmost length and 
breadth of the royal highway to the city of God. Organized 
Christianity, with its living ministry, its temples of song 
and worship, with millions of consecrated men and women
and little children, is your helper and comrade on the 
highway of light and truth. All things in the heights and 
depths and the rimless and measureless expansions, with 
their unknown and infinite capacities, realities and 
possibilities, and whatever else may exist in the concrete or in 
the abstract universe, are ready and waiting to gather up 
the reins and buckle up the habit and yoke on the pinions 
of flame and cut the belted and burning peripheries of the 
outermost glories of ethereal currents, that they may crown 
the royal hosts of Christ with the wreaths of conquerors and
the gems of kings.</p>
          <p>But Calvary is yours, with its dying Savior, its forsaken 
Son, its bleeding Victim, its smitten Shepherd, its scattered 
flock, and the uplifted sword of the executive God. “All 
things are yours.” Amen and amen! So let it be.</p>

          <head>The Christmas.</head>
          <p>No anniversary or celebration of any great event in 
the history of man contains within its significant parts and 
high symbolism, greater interests and broader and deeper 
relationship to the intelligent inhabitants of this earthly 
sphere than that which Christianity brings to remembrance 
by the annually returning Christmas. The wheels of ages, 
the revolution of planets, the flight of comets that spin and 
dance and wrap their golden trails around sidereal wonders, 
and carry the news of God from the seat of eternal power 
to the utmost periphery, bear no greater news in their eternal 
mail car than the birth of Christ, and the advent of 
the Son of Mary. In the history of God and man, and all 
the angels besides, there can take place no event of greater 
moment, of vaster, deeper, and more infinite import to the 
Adamic race. What event, era, age, cycle, or dispensation 
in the history of God and creation can be compared to it? 
What physical catastrophe, or mental evolution, or spiritual 
transition in the depth of being, in the wonderful universal 
mechanism can be compared to it? Far back in the misty 
deep of the cycles, before Aurora blushed at her halo of the 
morning flame, or the Polar star kissed her gorgeous trail 
on the Northern seas, and when as yet Alcyon had not 
stepped from the deep precincts of her boudoir and chained 
her burning sisters as sandals on her feet, when as yet the 
fiery mists rolled, soared, hissed, and in serpentine splendor 
moved about their own center, our Christianity, of which 
Christ is the active, forceful embodiment, sat in eternal
enthronization in the bosom of God, as the only possible
moral principle of His universal empire.</p>
          <pb id="hols204" n="204"/>
          <p>Again, we say there is no event in the history of man 
and God, whether physical or mental, that can be compared 
to the advent and birth of the great Messiah. The fall of 
the great Lucifer from the imperial empyrean, succeeding 
the great conflict of the loftiest majesties of the spheres and 
of the towering intellectualities of the universe, was a great 
event. It was <hi rend="italics">the</hi> battle of the eternal ages, the culmination 
of majestic insolence, the beginning of the sinful era, and 
a desperate effort of rebellious, sagacious, and powerful 
intellectual activities to take the reins of empire and the seat 
of God. It was the battle of gods in the heart of the 
empire, and at the seat of government. Proud Lucifer had 
been the tall archangel, the prime minister of the court of 
heaven, crowned with the belted cycles. He wore the robe 
of honor, the insignia of state—a thousand suns pinned 
together by a thousand comets, which threw back their burning 
tails in majestic folds and wide-spread seas of pyramidal 
light from pole to pole, high above his head; and expanding 
over all was the rainbow, radiant in the beauties of its seven 
colors, the God-given and sacred memento of universal and 
eternal peace. But the crisis is approaching. The relation 
between the oldest and mightiest sons of God is strained. 
The cables break, civic volcanoes explode, and the internecine 
and political convulsions unhinge the harmonies of the 
centuries. Fiery conclaves on steeds—ethereal currents,
like flashes of lightnings—thread and ramify the kingdoms,
thrones, dominions, principalities and powers. All the 
heights, depths, lengths, provinces, and eternal eras, with 
all their multitudes, are summoned to the battle of the 
cycles. But proud Lucifer, the first, the greatest and the 
oldest of sinners, fails, as all must fail who fight against God 
and challenge the throne and authority of the Most High. 
“How art thou fallen from Heaven, O Lucifer, son of the
morning.” This is a great event, the beginning of sin. But
<pb id="hols205" n="205"/>
Christ is born, and a greater event enters the record of the 
ages and the history of being. His nativity marks an era 
more distinguished, more interesting, and more universal 
than the loss of planets, or of the sinking suns and lost 
systems. In the starry frame of the constellated tracks of 
space, suns have ceased to shine, moons have waned to 
calcined dust, and old worlds have been honeycombed by the 
giant worm of decay. In the mid-ocean of the galaxies of 
sidereal systems, our proud earth, with her cold, chaste 
moon, the uncrowned pale empress of the night, is making 
her trip on the high seas of time. She belongs to an 
immediate system, and with each of her sisters is moved and 
warmed by the great sun; but the best message that ever 
fell upon her heart, in her onward flight through space, is
the nativity of Christ, the <sic corr="Anointed">Annointed</sic> of God, the Heavenly
Legate, the Savior of men, and the Preserver of angels.</p>
          <p>His name is the charm of centuries, the wand of the 
ages, the anthem of the nations and the inspiring melody 
of the spheres. God says, “I will make Thy name to be 
remembered in all generations, therefore shall the people 
praise Thee forever and ever.” Quickly and strongly down 
through the days of the onflow of the multitudes of aspiring 
millions, His name, like burnt incense ascending from the 
golden censers of adoring seraphs, shall be the chorus of 
the redemption anthem, the life of every song and the 
sweetness of every verse.</p>
          <p>Annalists and recording scribes may forget the name of 
the Cæsars, the Napoleons, and the noble founders and 
protectors of empires. Peoples, nations, monarchies, and 
republics may pass from the drama of nations. Bards, 
poets, and seers, and the skillful touchers of the organ 
keys may forget their national airs and the names of their 
glorified and deified heroes of a thousand battles, and their 
quivering strings of gold may lie silent upon their broken
<pb id="hols206" n="206"/>
harps and lutes. The eternal shafts and marble piles of 
fretted stone and towering columns, and all the dreamers 
that sleep in “the rock-ribbed” and bronze-bound sarcophagi 
may be forgotten, and the letters of their illustrious 
names erased by the abrasions of centuries; yet the name of 
Jesus—the Christ—will never be forgotten, but will go 
ringing down the declivities of the world's civilizations, 
sweeping on in the radiant splendors of its own effulgent
brightness, until every lip shall lisp His name, every tongue
spread His fame, yea, until every heart is a throne, every
soul a temple, and every child of man a polished gem to
stud and bedeck a trophied empire, gathered and sorted out
from the perverse and rebellious majesties and actualities
of sin and darkness.</p>
          <p>But the time was approaching for the great nativity. The
purposes of God were ripening fast. The prophets had
waited long, sung of His coming, dreamed of His triumphs,
descanted in solemn lays upon their stringed instruments
and played on their high-sounding cymbals the preludes to
His dramatic majesty upon the public stage of nations. The
magi in far distant climes of the East had calculated upon
tablets of golden plate the time of His appearing. The
flight of stars, the flash of comets, and the position of planets, 
were studied and catalogued, and the lost Pleiades,
called up from the infinite <sic corr="plenitudes">plentitudes</sic> of their long 
disappearance, read the predictions of His coming from their 
fiery rings and the flitting phantasmagoria of their sheeny
trails. The philosophical archives of ancient lore, and the
hieroglyphics of occult syllogisms were laid open to the
calm visions and the cold judgment of the deepest and the
keenest occultism. The fall of meteors, the dance of the
aurora borealis in awful display around the, northern 
hemisphere, the dull cold thud of earthquakes, the howling seas
and the hum and stately tramp of receding centuries were
<pb id="hols207" n="207"/>
marked, and the hands upon the dial plate of time were 
watched, and their epochal relations measured and weighed 
until the high-born beauties and majesties of the universe 
spoke to men in the language of the stars, and told of His 
coming. The last of the four great monarchies—the four 
great acts in the drama of human government—Rome—
was quivering upon its ancient foundations, and the kingdom 
of the Tiber with its hoary locks of the ages was 
stooping to the weight of years. “The scepter had departed 
from Judah,” the Jewish polity was broken, and the throne 
of David and Solomon was a thing of the past. Up, up, 
the days of the centuries climb, angels watch, cherubs drop 
their wings, all harps are unstrung, cymbals cease to vibrate 
their symphonies, and the diatonic chords of the universal 
diapason lose their music in the sea of silence. The court 
of heaven is open; awful muteness that could be felt 
myriads of leagues from center toward circumference seals 
every lip and tongue, relaxes every harp sting, and the 
immortal celebration is hushed.</p>
          <p>So He came, and so He was born in Bethlehem of
Judea. “And the angel said unto them, ‘Fear not, for 
behold I bring good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all
people, for unto you is born this day in the City of David,
a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.’” * * * “Glory
to God in the highest, and on earth, peace, good will 
toward men.” Blessed nativity! blessed birth of “the Prince
of Peace!” Blessed Legate from the court of heaven!</p>
          <p>But what of His work? He is here to stay, not in His 
physical manhood, but in spiritual power. He is here to 
deal with the nations, to elevate humanity and purify the 
civilizations of the world. Christmas ever calls to memory 
His advent, nature and work. But how sweet is the name 
of Christ, and of Jesus! It is associated with human happiness 
and human redemption. It is the light of the nations,
<pb id="hols208" n="208"/>
the guiding star of the millions, and the balm for every
aching heart. Some man has said in effect, that the time
would come when the name of Jesus Christ would be blotted 
from the face of the earth. But how can it be? Who
can blot it out? Who can hush the millions and erase from
their “heart of hearts” the beauties of his grace, or the
melody of his name? Sirs, if men should hold their peace,
the very stones would cry out. Sweet carols would spring
from the earth, and songs of praise from the rocks of the
hills. The rivers would murmur it, the little rills would
babble it, the seas with a thousand bass drum would roar
it, the storms would howl it, and the winds would whistle
among the glades and valleys and trees of the woods, 
until every leaf, bud, trunk, fruit, and flower would
quiver beneath the melodies of His name and the joys of
His salvation. Yea, every dead prophet, bard, seer and
evangelical poet would leap from his grave, tune his golden
notes afresh, call up all the choirs of the nations, and gather
the broken chords of the centuries. Before His name can
be blotted out every Bible must be burnt up, every church
torn down, every Sunday-school annihilated, and every
minister and working saint and pious heart crushed to 
insensibility. What will you do with David and Asaph, the
sweet singers in Israel? What will you do with Milton,
Watts, Toplady, Charles Wesley, and the other tens of 
thousands who tuned their harps on Calvary, and from its
crimson summit caught the inspiration of heaven in their 
hearts, and poured their anthems with plastic fingers in the
bosom of the rhythmic rills of heavenly lays? What will
you do with the redeemed soul fresh and green in the 
transcendencies and beatific transitions of the new life? When
rightly played man is a harp of a thousand strings, keyed,
and attuned by the holy name of Jesus Christ. This harp
was made after the heavenly pattern. It is the lyre of
<pb id="hols209" n="209"/>
God. Its strings are of the loftiest cast and of the finest 
mould, whose threads never break, whose music, though 
old, is always new. Its songs are long, deep, melodious, 
sweeping down from heaven to Calvary in melting softness 
and dulcet strain which thunders in awful refrain in the 
depth of the spheres, causing to vibrate every quivering 
thread and living octave. Blot out the name of Jesus? It 
cannot be done. No! The stars would hand it down, the 
moon would kiss it, the sun would shine it through all the 
planets, and ethereal currents would waft it on wings of 
flame, and the lightnings of God would hurl it and burn it 
across the bosom of “Arcturus, Orion, Pleiades and the 
chambers of the South.” Then let the inhabitants of the 
earth take up the thrilling cry and with lip and tongue, with 
harp and fife and drum, chant the Te Deum of the ages and 
the melodies of His name forever and forever.</p>

          <head>The Unity of Force.</head>
          <p>It is evident from the teachings of the Bible, and 
spiritual and physical activities, that there is but one moving,
all-pervading, central, living energy. Deep down beneath
and passing through and rising above all principles, things,
and agencies, there is an intelligent reality, a forceful, 
inherent and active life. This active life is before all things,
in all space, permeating every particle of universal matter
and spirit, guiding, directing and controlling the countless
and eternal activities. There may be rest, but not real
quietism. There can be no quietism in a moving 
universe. Life itself is activity, and that that acts is
life. Since life is activity there is nothing else to
act. The life of the universe is the central or universal
mentality, and is the unit of force. Force is only a part of 
the universal mentality, that part, or that property, or 
faculty, that agitates, oscillates, or stirs the elements and 
constituencies. Nothing can move or vibrate except as it is
moved upon or vibrated by the universal mentality.</p>
          <p>One of the most wonderful and distinguishing properties 
or faculties of the universal mentality is wisdom, that
perfect knowledge of all the entities, results, and facts of 
being. State or condition has no effect upon universality.
State or no state, condition or no condition, cannot destroy
or annul the property of universality any more than state
or condition can destroy or annihilate being. Nothing can
<sic corr="annihilate">anihilate</sic> being. It is an eternal, an indestructible, and
divine entity. Being is a reality that is independent of 
matter, even in its highest possible mode of existence, or in its
greatest volatile or ethereal vitality. There is no living
<pb id="hols211" n="211"/>
factor in the universe but mind. All else is dead, mute and 
inert. The universe around us, above us and beneath us, 
acts only as it is acted upon by the spiritual, universal 
intelligence—the incomprehensible mentality. Matter acts, 
therefore, because it is acted upon by a power that is above 
it in degrees of those constituent properties that characterize 
its superiority belonging only to itself. If there were 
a mental force equal to another mental force, with equal 
intelligence, there could be no unity of force any more than 
there could be “the unity of nature and the reign of law.” 
Hence all the phenomena in nature harmonize with the 
highest concepts of wisdom and lead us unto the temple of
the enthroned and incomprehensible intelligence. There is 
no real inherent force, life, or action in matter, and 
consequently none in the universe, except this, or the universal 
intelligence, and all that we see or comprehend in physical 
nature is the product of universal mind. To comprehend 
the measure and the mode of the existence of mind, or even 
to hint at the unknowable and infinite deeps out of which 
it rises in resplendent unity of being and action, would 
eventuate in nothing, and a thousand billions of centuries 
would leave us as far from the solution as we are to-day. 
It is not a province of thought or comprehension, for in 
these mighty deeps and unzoned seas of mental reality, the
wing of thought, or the pinions of the imagination never 
can rest, roll, or soar. The presentation of metaphysical 
syllogism teaches us that there is but one reality in the 
universe, and that is mind. There is no other reality in the 
sense that it has its own inherent and self-activities. 
Nothing can be a true reality but that which has self-action 
and unified personal proclivities and spiritual individuality.</p>
          <p>The doctrine that teaches the unity of force does not in 
any sense teach the doctrine of monism, because the unit of 
force has intelligence that is plainly to be seen in every
<pb id="hols212" n="212"/>
part of the universe. There can be no design without 
intelligence, or that power that designs and chooses the best
and fittest means to accomplish the best and fittest ends.
Wisdom is the property of mind, that mental unity of
character or individualism; and since mind must act in
harmony with itself, it is of necessity a unit. Monism
teaches the unity of force, (but a force that is in itself blind,
and has no intelligence, no personality of being or design,)
and that the vast results and products of the universe
arise out of the precipitant elements and the fortuitous
vibrations of its parts. It denies all mental intelligence and
spiritual activities, except such as arise out of the fortuitous 
combinations of precipitant forces and vibratory 
elements; it denies that there is any such thing as mind or
mental character beyond that which has been produced by
physical nature, and asserts that the mental faculties of man
(or spirits, if there be any) are the products of mere molecular 
force or action with chemical combinations under happy
conditions. This view leaves the universe without a 
designing mental individualism that we call the universal
intelligence, and shuts us up to ill fatalities and capricious
chance, and allows the universe, like an unguided ship upon
some vast sea, to float in space without chart or compass,
leaving the boundless and unnumbered worlds to ply on
their own chosen orbits without let or design. Think of it.
A universe running away with itself. Possibly it may come
in contact or collision with another. Then what? The
thought is ridiculous and also stupendous. Under it, the
stoutest must quiver and the souls of towering spirits must
quail as the unthinkable catastrophe photographs its shapeless 
image upon the undying mentalism.</p>
          <p>So far as science is concerned, the unity of force is proved 
by the form or shape of all the known systems or worlds
<pb id="hols213" n="213"/>
that float in space. None of them are yet proved to be
square, oblong, ovate, octangular, or rhomboidal, but all
are round, or spheroidal. And so far as we know, the very
molecules, or the atomic aggregations of bodies, in their
most subtle particles, and in themselves, are round. One
is made to correspond to all of the others in the vast 
machinery of the universe. It seems apparent that in no other
way could perfect harmony be produced and maintained.
It is believed that planets have, by some marvelous and
eruptive force, been broken to pieces and forced into space,
and that in process of time they have become round, because
in no other way could they regain and maintain those 
harmonious relations and conditions that are essential to the
order and happiness of the intelligent universe. If nature
was the author and creator of itself, which is incapable of
designs, why is it that all these worlds and systems of worlds
are made round? Why is it that none of them are square,
oblong, rectangular or some other shape besides the globular? 
Why they are formed thus, is because the universal
intelligence, the infinite mentality so designed them that
the beauty and harmony and glory of the universe might
be a dwelling-place and a magnificent temple for “the
Father of Lights” and His intelligent offsprings, the 
shining phalanxes and legates of His love.</p>

          <head>The Colored Methodist Episcopal Church.</head>
          <head>
            <hi rend="italics">(Published in The Independent, March, '91.)</hi>
          </head>
          <p>This, the youngest branch of American Methodism, was
organized under the auspices and authority of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, South, in the city of Jackson, Tenn.,
December 15th and 23d, 1870. As for back as 1866, its
organization was contemplated and desired by both classes
of those who composed the membership of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, South. In this year (1866) the General
Conference of the Mother Church requested their bishops
to ordain colored men to the ministry, form them into 
conferences, preside over and superintend the colored work in
assemblies, separate and distinct from those of the whites.
It was also provided “that when three or more annual 
conferences of colored ministers were organized and presided
over by the bishops” of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
South; and that also when thought befitting and agreeable
to both classes of members, “a separate and independent
ecclesiastical jurisdiction should be established for the 
colored people,” with all the regularities and outfits of 
established Methodism.</p>
          <p>These initiatory provisions, being agreeable to both 
classes of persons concerned, and being consistent with 
what was conceived to be the harmony and best interests of 
both and all, the separation was authorized—legal, formal, 
and productive of the best feelings and results.</p>
          <p>It is simply justice to state that the Methodist Episcopal
Church, South, at the beginning of the late war, had over 
two hundred thousand members of color within her pales,
<pb id="hols215" n="215"/>
having churches of their own, and ministers sent to them
regularly from the conferences. Often one pastor served
both the white and the colored members, preaching to the
whites in the forenoon and to the colored in the afternoon.
Of this two hundred thousand, the great majority informally 
dissolved their relationship with the Methodist Episcopal 
Church, South, and went into other branches of 
Methodism, the African Methodist Episcopal Church receiving
the largest share of them. However, there still remained
about forty thousand who adhered to the Methodist Episcopal 
Church, South, and who could not be induced to 
disband their church relation and enter others which came
upon the ground immediately after the emancipation. For
some years after the war the reduced number of members
of color who still remained adherents of the Methodist 
Episcopal Church, South, was looked after and cared for as was
the case during the years of slavery. As the General 
Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, which
met in New Orleans, May, 1866, had authorized the bishops
to organize conferences of colored ministers, so, four years
after, the same body held its quadrennial session in 
Memphis, Tenn.; and upon the petition of some of the leading
colored ministers, the General Conference of the Mother
Church delegated their bishops, with other distinguished
ministers and laymen, to organize the colored members
into a separate and distinct body, which was satisfactorily
consummated in December of the same year (1810).</p>
          <p>The organization of this branch of our common Methodism 
seemed necessary for several reasons.</p>
          <p>Among them we may note the following: As a result,
the war had changed the ancient relation of master and
servant. The former, though divested of his slaves, yet
carried with him all the notions, feelings and elements in
his religious and social life that characterized his former
<pb id="hols216" n="216"/>
years. On the other hand, the emancipated slave had but 
little in common with the former master. In fact, he had 
nothing but his religion, poverty and ignorance. With 
social elements so distinct and dissimilar, the best results 
of a common church relation could not be expected. 
Harmony, friendship and peaceful co-operation between the 
two peoples in the propagation of a divine and vital 
Christianity, were among the essential elements of a successful 
evangelization of the people of color. Social religious 
equality, as well as any other kind of social equality, was 
utterly impracticable and undesirable, and coveted by 
neither class of persons composing a churchship.</p>
          <p>With this state of things steadily in view, we had but 
one horn of the dilemma left us, and that was a free, 
friendly and authorized separation from the mother body. 
Although we are become two bands, yet it is, and was 
understood that this does not, in any sense, release the 
Methodist Episcopal Church, South, from those duties and 
obligations that Providence seems to have imposed upon her, 
in aiding the American African in his Christian development.</p>
          <p>The Colored Methodist Episcopal Church in America 
has had a remarkable career. As a branch or product of the 
Methodist Episcopal Church, South, it has been opposed by 
strong hands and accomplished leaders among the colored 
people, from its birthday to the present; though, happily 
for us, these oppositions are now subsiding and the young 
organization is taking on a firm and expanding aspect that is 
most interesting and extraordinary. To sustain and propagate 
such an institution amid so many opposing forces as 
those that have presented themselves for the last twenty
years, seemed, at first, to be a forlorn and hopeless 
undertaking. Green from the fields of slavery, raw in the 
experiences of church tactics, in membership and ministry,
<pb id="hols217" n="217"/>
without houses of worship or literature, with many of its
organizing feats being performed out of doors and under 
trees, it overcame difficulties that make it more than a
mere experiment. Being in the dews of its youth, it has
not yet attained its destined dignity and power for good
among the colored race. But it is advancing in every 
department.</p>
          <p>Its aim is the evangelization of the colored race. First, 
by preaching the pure and simple gospel of Christ to the
masses, in the simplest form of speech. Second, to do this
in the best and most effective manner, we aim, as far as
possible, to establish and maintain schools for the impartation 
of Christian education among our people, and especially 
among the ministry, and that part of the race who are 
expecting to be teachers. As we cannot expect to do a 
great deal at present, by way of educating the masses, we 
begin with preachers and teachers, carefully and patiently 
training and indoctrinating them in those great moral and 
religious principles that lie at the base of an elevated and 
sound moral manhood. It is said that man is naturally a 
religious being. The sense of a Supreme Power intrudes 
itself upon all his spiritual and moral functions, and if men 
in general are thus religionists, the colored man is particularly 
so. He seems especially susceptible of religious culture 
and of reaching those spiritual climaxes and benedictions 
that have characterized the most pious of men. While 
these seem apparent facts, it is also apparent that all these 
safeguards of the gospel, and those that have grown out of 
the experiences of men, should be thrown around him, lest 
his Christian or religious zeal should subvert, cover or hide 
the weightier matters of the moral law, and those principles 
and practices that constitute the vital flame of the reformatory 
moral power of Christianity. Christianity pure and 
simple is what he needs. As a church, we came upon the
<pb id="hols218" n="218"/>
stage of being to propagate the gospel along these lines and 
no others. To sustain this position we have always stood 
aloof from politics, not as individuals, but as officials 
representing an organization for a certain and specific purpose.</p>
          <p>While our ministry and members represent all political
parties and creeds, yet, as ministers of the gospel, we make 
no stump-speeches and fight no battles of the politicians. 
We think it better to “let the dead bury the dead,” while we 
follow Christ. Of course we have no control over any 
man's vote; whether he be minister or member, he is free 
to vote as he pleases. We regard Christianity not only as 
reformatory and redeeming, but as a moral power of 
civilization. At present, it must be acknowledged that Negro 
civilization is yet in its infancy and crude evolutions.
He is now laying the foundations upon which future 
generations are to build those institutions that are to make him 
and his progeny solid Christians and valued citizens. We 
regard him as a part of the people, a permanent fixture in 
the United States of America. It is true, we hope, that 
many of the race will, some day, go to Africa—their native 
land—but the masses will fight the battle of life here, and 
live and die on the American continent. We also recognize 
the fact that he is, and will be, singularly and collectively, a 
separate and distinct race from the others. </p>
          <p>Friction in church or state cannot be productive of good 
to him and his children, and we think it is a legitimate part 
of Christianity to ameliorate and soften those cruder conditions
under which he finds himself as an element in society; 
hence, we seek the friendship of all, and especially 
and particularly the fatherly directorship of the 
Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Beyond and behind the 
immediate work of the christianization of the colored race, 
there lie a faith, a principle, and a practice, that seem peculiar 
and interesting; and as these factors have done much to
<pb id="hols219" n="219"/>
unite the races in harmonious co-operation and exile any 
hostile feelings that may have existed in the South between 
the two. Their aim is to bring about peace, and perpetuate 
the era of mutual brotherhood and concert of action.</p>
          <p>We claim that the spirit, nature and practice of the 
Colored Methodist Episcopal Church in America have done, 
and are doing much in this direction. Some have thought 
that Providence has placed it where it is for this 
purpose. Already it has enlisted the special attention of the 
Methodist Episcopal Church, South, which by legislative 
action has appointed a Commissioner of Education for the 
purpose of establishing and maintaining schools for “the 
education of preachers and teachers,” for the Colored 
Methodist Episcopal Church in America. This educational 
interest is controlled by the two churches jointly for the 
benefit of the Colored Church. It is the aim of this church 
to prosecute the work along these lines in the fear of God 
and in the love of a common humanity.</p>

          <pb id="hols220" n="220"/>
          <head>The Origin and Place of Religion in Civilization.</head>
          <p>Religion may be defined as that service, consisting in
worship, adoration and sacrifice which man renders to a
supreme, or some being or beings that he supposes to be
superior to himself—superior to himself in wisdom, power,
knowledge, and indefinite existence.</p>
          <p>The consciousness of a supreme, enduring, and 
all-pervading Energy is a faculty of the human mind. It is an 
ineradicable and indestructible element of man's nature. It 
is God-given, inherent, and not acquired by practice, reason, 
or learning. This religious faculty in man generates 
those elements of moral conceptions upon which the moral 
government of God is founded, and is the means of 
communication between the finite and the Infinite, and is that 
ever-present and far-reaching medium by which the voice 
of the Creator ever rings in the hearts of the created
intelligences.</p>
          <p>That man in his native elements is a religionist, not only
accords with the history of the race, but is reasonable and
consonant with his nature and the highest ends of his 
being. It is not necessary to be sinful before being religious. 
Had there been no sin in the universe, or no infraction 
of the laws that govern it, whether these laws be physical, 
mental, or spiritual, the religious faculty still would be
a real and constituent part of all intelligences. As man is
a thinking, free moral agency, he is necessarily a part of the
great whole—a part of the great intelligent system. So far
as the moral nature of man is concerned, it must be like that
which all other moral beings have. The different spheres 
in the great moral system of the universe have no tendency
<pb id="hols221" n="221"/>
to change the moral constitution so as to make it different 
in one class of moral beings from that in another, unless 
there could exist two moral systems in one, which is an 
absurdity. As there can be but one God, there can be but one 
government presiding over the whole. The moral laws are, 
therefore, the same in principle, and have the same ends 
in view in every part of the intelligent creation. It is also 
evident that the different modes of intelligent existence have 
nothing to do with the inherent qualities of their moral 
natures. Man would be man without his body or corporeal 
delineations, and angels would be none the less angels if 
clothed in mortal parts as we have. There may be lower 
and higher degrees of moral capability, as there are in 
intelligent capacity, but the innate and controlling principles
are the same. As place and mode of existence cannot 
change moral law and moral nature in their inherent qualities, 
neither can the siege of ages nor the extending cycles. 
In other words, conditions cannot change the moral 
universe so as to make it something else different from what it 
is. It is what it is because it is the moral system. The 
system cannot be changed, any more than right can be 
made wrong, and wrong can be made right. It may 
be possible to annihilate the subjects of the moral 
system, and any physical part that may be connected 
with it, but not its inherent qualities. These are 
what they are because they cannot cease to be, nor 
grow into something else. Thus the moral system must 
remain forever intact in all the <sic corr="plenitude">plentitude</sic> of its primary 
elements. If these premises are properly taken, then the 
government of God is necessarily a unit. It has an eternal
oneness in nature and execution in all places and times, and 
is unaffected by mere conditions. While the moral system 
itself is distinct and different from its subjects or participants, 
yet it presupposes their existence, while, if they do
<pb id="hols222" n="222"/>
exist, they cannot evade its obligations my more than they
can evade the realization of their own being. Wherever there
is intelligence, there must be consciousness and moral force
and sense of obligation and responsibility. These are 
prominent faculties of the mind, and prove the existence of it,
and force the thinking creature to think of his conscious
moral obligations. Here, in the virgin soil of his nature,
man finds those promptings, desires and proclivities that we
might well call <hi rend="italics">the religious faculty</hi>—faculty of his being,
or attributes of his mental constitution. It is no argument
against this position that some few have been found who
are destitute of moral ideas and religious proclivities, if,
indeed, there ever were such beings in existence. It is not
to be denied that it is possible, in some cases, to suppress
to a degree that is almost latent the religious faculty, yet
in such cases these are no more silent and latent than the
other faculties that are as little used. In any state below
and on the line of civilization the human intellect will use
those faculties that are most productive of the present and
greatest good, because they are factors and manufactories
of his immediate wants and daily needs. Forced by hunger
and thirst, and the desire for the comforts of life, man, like
the birds of prey or the beasts of the field, makes every effort
to supply and provide himself with the things that seem
needed for his happiness and well-being. Thus all his 
faculties that are useful for this purpose are especially
aroused, cultivated, and stimulated to high degrees. By
their use they are made more prominent and distinct. So
with the religious faculties. They may be active or 
dormant to a greater or less degree by culture or less culture.
So it is with all the attributes of the human mind. The
Creator gave the mind complete in all its distinct attributes
or characteristics, but its progressive development is left to
conditions. How far mankind is responsible for favorable 
<pb id="hols223" n="223"/>
or unfavorable conditions in which to culture the mind 
need not now be elaborated. But sufficient has been said
to disprove that, because the religious faculties are not
particularly active in all, they do not naturally exist in any.
The fact that all the great peoples of the earth have been
religious is clear evidence that man is naturally so, and it 
also proves that every man is religious, except where the 
faculties and proclivities have been overshadowed by 
artificial means, as in the case of the atheist.</p>
          <p>So far as we have come, we have dwelt upon the inherent
emanations of religion in its origin, and we conclude that 
man is naturally a religious being, that the religious 
faculty is organic, God-given, and is an essential element of his 
being, and is just as enduring and abiding as any other 
attribute of his nature. He is, therefore, most natural when 
he is religious, and most unnatural when he is not religious.</p>
          <p>False religion, so-called, is only a part of religion 
corrupted by superstitions, false additions, mutilations and
erroneous interpretations. From the beginning it was not
so. All the different forms of religious beliefs and faiths
must have had the same beginning and the same parent
stem. They must be branches of the same vine, or 
ramifications of the same great original. All their great moral
ideas that have come down to us through the ages came
through different channels, but came from the same true
and pure fountain whose great original is the Creator. He
first gave to His human offsprings, by symbolic and oracular 
demonstrations, as well as by internal emanations, what
He would have them do, and as the generations dispersed
into different climes they carried with them the germ
thoughts of religion. But being corrupted, these germ
thoughts of religion did not reproduce their exact originals,
and as time rolled on, the originals were more and more
corrupted until complete reproduction was impossible.
<pb id="hols224" n="224"/>
Then human additions were made to take their places.
Hence we have the so-called false religions. But let it be
remembered, that one and all of these must have had a
common origin.</p>
          <p>The name of God, in some form, is common in 
all known languages, and is spelled with four 
letters in almost all of them, indicating the unity and
oneness in the origin of religion. For instance, it
is in Latin, Deus; Greek, Theos; Hebrew, Adon; Syriac,
Adad; Arabian, Alla; Persian, Sjra; Tatarian, Idga;
Egyptian, Aumn, or Zeut; East Indian, Esgi or Zenl; 
Japanese, Zain; Turkish, Addi; <sic corr="Scandinavian">Scandivanian</sic>, Odin; 
Wallachian, Zenc; Croatian, Doga; Dalmatian, Rogt; Tyrrenian,
Eher; Etruian, Chur; Margarian, Oese; Swedish, Gud;
Irish, Dich; German, Gott; French, Dieu; Spanish, Dios;
Peruvian, Lian; English, Deity, God.</p>
          <p>As religion has a oneness in its origin, so the oldest form
of it must have been monotheistic, and not polytheistic.
And when God proclaimed himself to Israel as “one God,”
He merely reaffirmed the more ancient truth delivered to
the first of his human offsprings. He uncovered what, in
many instances, had been hidden for long ages, and the
broken lines of the first principles of religion were gathered
and rejoined in the brighter light of the ascending centuries. 
It is true that God represents himself by many names,
but never as more than one Being. The Elohistic and
Jehovistic views presented in Genesis present to the mind
only an individual God. The first conceptions of His
character and individual Being by His intelligent creatures
was that of oneness. We could not suppose God to be
more than one individual Being, and yet proclaiming
himself to be more than one. That is, we could not suppose
He would teach His natural offsprings what is not true, or 
false. God can only speak truth.</p>
          <pb id="hols225" n="225"/>
          <p>Again, as God is one, and religion has a oneness in origin,
so its first great moral idea is one, which is the conception
of Deity. The first thing in worship or adoration is the
attraction of the one to be adored. And if there are, in the
religions of the world, polytheistic ideas (and there are),
they are subsequent additions or interpolations. But no
matter what may have been the changes transpiring under
varied conditions and diversified experiences of mankind,
adoration has always been the central moral idea of 
religion. So far as we know, it is so in all religions, among
all peoples and ages. And so far as this central idea goes,
all religions are true when directed to the only one true
God. The term, “false religions,” is a misnomer, if we
include the honest adoration of the heart. The object may
be false, but not the adoration or the religion. It is possible 
for a man to be honest, even when he adores a false
deity, if he knows no better way to be religious. To that
extent all religions are true. The cardinal idea, then, is to
worship or to adore the Supreme Being, or any being whom
the worshipper supposes supreme. This is the first great
moral idea in religion, whether it be the Christian or any
other religion. And this great moral idea, found in all 
religions, and in all ages, takes us back to the oneness of
origin, where God first gave His commandments to the sons
of men. Religion rests, not only upon the nature of man
as regards his needs, but rests equally upon philosophical
bases. Of course, there is much connected with religion
that is not religious, nor religion. When we go out into the
kingdom and vast domain of religion, and view its subjects
and the results of its long and continuous administration
through the ages, we conceive that it has a powerful and
indestructible grasp upon human nature. This is so, not
only because religion is a fixed faculty in the nature of
moral beings, but also because it rests upon philosophical
<pb id="hols226" n="226"/>
bases, found in the needs of man and the government of
God. If there is a supreme moral Governor of the 
universe, then men and angels, or all intelligences come within
the limits of that supreme moral government. When,
therefore, adoration is demanded by the Creator, it is the
most reasonable service, and the greatest that may be 
rendered to the great Author of being. Man is not his own
creator. He did not make himself nor institute the laws
by which he came into being; he has no power to create or
to spring from elements already in existence. No affinity
of co-operative forces, controlling precipitant elements,
could produce and round into the masterly parts displayed
in the constitution of man. That which did not previously
exist, could not, of itself, begin to be. If it began to be,
there must have been a creative force and fiat that lay
deeper and beyond. Hence, intelligent creatures are all 
dependent—dependent upon that creative force and fiat that
gave them being. What, then, is more reasonable than the
praise and the adoration which mankind is required to 
render to God? By this we acknowledge his supreme greatness,
his authority, power, and glory. By this the moral organs
and mental sensibility come in contact with the Creator, and
the harmonious relations of the finite and Infinite are kept
in unison throughout an indefinite line of being in the
moral system. Remove religion from the intelligent
sphere, and the harmonious relations between God and His
intelligent creatures are broken off, and sin and rebellion
are the natural results.</p>
          <p>So far we have dwelt upon religion, pure and simple, as
to the oneness of its origin, and as a faculty of the human
race.</p>
          <p>Christianity is all of religion, and more than mere religion. 
Religion is a part of Christianity, but not all of Christianity. 
Religion is the nucleus of light in the moral system.
<pb id="hols227" n="227"/>
Christianity is the meridian sun of its day. One is the seed
planted and germinating, the other is the ripening corn in 
the ear. Yet, as the seed and ear are the same, so is 
religion and Christianity. They are two parts of a great 
whole in the developing and expanding moral system. 
Christianity reveals God and His government, not in a 
contrary nature, but in the more radiant splendors of the 
rising day and ascending centuries. Christianity is not only 
the doctrines and precepts of Christ, but a farther definition 
and clearer interpretation of the moral faculty and adoring 
proclivities of intelligent agents. It calls man to the 
worship and service of the Supreme Creator in stronger 
tones and deeper accents of love. It gathers up the broken 
threads of the ages, and rallies the moral forces to one 
bright center, and by its elective affinity, gathers all the 
gems of truth, and wreathes them about the brow of Christ. 
But religion is a sleepless active force in civilization. 
It is not bound by continents or ages. It is more than 
national, and more than cosmopolitan. As it is superhuman 
in its origin, it is universal in its operative function. Everywhere 
it has left its imprint upon individual character and 
national life. Christianity is not an ethnic religion, but the 
real and absolute religion of mankind. It is the religion 
of the universe, because it is obedience to God, love, and 
righteousness. It is an unchangeable fact, and abides 
forever the richest inheritance of man and angels. Its career 
is coeval with all the intellectual offsprings of God, and 
cognate with their incipient conceptions of Deity. They 
cannot think of themselves nor contemplate the dignity and 
wonders of creation without contemplating the masterly 
Hand that gave them their being. Everywhere God 
impresses himself upon His works. Every spring of the 
intelligent mind bounds toward Him. Ethereal splendors and 
terrestrial wonders attract every mind and thrill every 
heart.</p>
          <pb id="hols228" n="228"/>
          <p>As a factor and element in human civilization, it is the
strongest, and the most vivacious of all the regenerative 
forces among men. Step by step, it has weighed the 
nations in its scales, and measured the civilizations of the 
world. All the virtue and respect for law and order that 
have prevailed among the civilizations of man, have had 
their foundation in his religious proclivity. It awakens the 
most astounding inquiries respecting the greatest interests 
of man and God. It gives wings to the imagination, faith 
to the life, and light and energy to the understanding, and 
reveals to man that which he could not discover. It 
enlarges the desire, quickens the spiritual force, and expands 
the spiritual entities. Christianity is the only system that 
places man in his real and true relation to God, his Father, 
and man, his brother. All the great moral ideas that underlie 
the governments and institutions of mankind which have 
stood the shock of ages and the ravages of time, have lived 
because of those grains of religion that have more or less 
been prominent in their constitutional and executive fitness. 
The strength and durability of human governments do not 
lie in their mere capacity, force or power, arising from 
numbers, wealth and intelligence. Of course these elements 
are essentials of government, but not the preservatives. 
Back of these there must be a dominant force—a silent 
energy—far more reaching and widespread than mere 
capacity founded upon the devices and achievements of the 
intellect. The cornerstone of enduring institutions must
necessarily be founded upon truth and rectitude—the love 
of virtue and the fear of God—which are the essential parts 
or ideal contingencies of practical religion. To put the case 
in clearer light, we point with a sigh to the decay of all the 
great governments and empires that have acted their part 
in the ages and the dramas of nations. They were great, 
strong, rich and mighty in word and deed, but they passed
<pb id="hols229" n="229"/>
away because they violated all those great principles, 
promptings and practices that are the only fundamental 
basis of enduring institutions. No law of right, whether 
in heaven or earth, can be violated by intelligent beings 
unless they suffer at some time and in some place condign 
punishment. Religion in civilization is, therefore, not the 
criterion and revealer to aspiring <hi rend="italics">humanity</hi> only, but it 
presents the reasons why <hi rend="italics">kingdoms</hi> fail and <hi rend="italics">governments</hi> 
perish. There is nothing in the nature and theory of human 
government why they should not continue indefinitely. In
themselves they are neither sinful nor useless. They are 
the God-given instruments to promote the greatest good 
and the universal well-being of man. But when they 
defeat the ends of righteousness, only one thing can follow, 
and that is, “eternal sleep.” Still, as from the broken 
trunks of fallen trees, new growths repeat the acts of sires, 
so new nations arise upon the stocks of their predecessors, 
in which is continued the civilizations of the world. 
Civilization is but the product, or offspring of religion. Among 
the earliest of religious thoughts, come those efforts and 
inventions that have laid the foundation for civil and social 
comfort, and the employment of those resources and powers 
of mental and physical nature by which mankind has 
triumphed over difficulties and made obstinate elements yield 
their richest treasures to his happiness and glory. While 
religion is adorative in its primitive emanations, operating
in the deepest centers of character, yet it begets a lively 
hope and struggles for the larger goal beyond, where all 
the elements of expanding character and mental growth 
seek and use the fittest means to accomplish the fittest ends. 
Civilization is the difference between the kingdom of 
Dahomey and the British Isles. In the beginning both 
were alike—crude, low, vulgar, and beastly—in their 
primitive modes. The best explanation that may be given 
<pb id="hols230" n="230"/>
respecting the long distance between the two is: One is 
Christian and the other heathen—one religious intelligently, 
and the other religious superstitiously. The one has great 
intellectual light, which is largely the force of Christianity, 
while the other has less light with but the alphabet of 
civilization. Indeed, religion and civilization are so near akin 
that to destroy religion or remove it entirely from the state 
and the thoughts of men, there would remain no more of 
the one than of the other. The native constitution of man 
with his environments forbids him to be truly civilized without 
religion, or the prominence of the religious faculty. 
The place of religion in civilization is, therefore, to force its 
quickening energies along its lines and serial developments, 
and expand its golden peripheries amid the sleepless evolution 
of the ages. Its office is to elevate the standard of 
taste, direct the moral propulsion and dignity of humanity 
in all its phases.</p>
          <p>The prominent features of Christianity are its progressive 
and aggressive forces. It cannot absorb, but it disintegrates. 
It cannot change its teachings, practices, nor phases 
any more than it can change its origin and nature. 
Its momentum and agencies may be variant, but its 
inherent elements are changeless and eternal. There are 
depths and heights in the evolving problems of Christianity 
that can only come in the fulness of its career among 
the peoples of the world. Its inventory of successive 
manifestations constantly presents the moral and physical
systems, in more exalted fitness, as the only instrumentality to
bring out the highest and purest forms of social and civil 
life. Everywhere its theory of morals and purity of life 
present the highest ideal of perfection. It is the universal 
code without a codicil. It is so universal and minutely 
applicable that there is no room in the boundless sphere of 
being for another. No other system can take its place
<pb id="hols231" n="231"/>
among intelligent beings, because it has all the place that
can be occupied. It forces man to think of God, of heaven,
of hell, and those solemn and substantial realities that await
him in the endless future. All of its proposed measures,
tenets and doctrines are directed toward the amelioration
of the race of man. Man could not expect any richer 
inheritance from the Almighty Parent; for he had nothing
better to bestow upon his offspring.</p>
          <p>Christianity is never the foe of man, but is always the
foe of his foes, and as an armed sentinel it exists to guard
all the interests of the children of men, in all those great
concerns and multiform relations that make up the history
of being. It is not only progressive, but aggressive. It
comes to assault sin and evil in all their rock-ribbed and
steel-clad ramparts. It has an arm of power, backed by
infinite resources, even the whole breadth, depth, and
height of the changeless Absolute. Slowly but surely it is
at work upon the world's civilizations, transforming society,
changing sentiment and human thought, correcting judgment, 
enthroning reason, imparting justice and crowning
wisdom with the diadem of truth. It hushes the din of 
battles, breaks the iron sinews of bloody strife, stops the 
pursuits of war, and as sweetly and softly as fall the silent rays
of the setting sun, it calls the nations to the legitimate 
avocations of life. Christianity is here to stay as long as this
terrestrial sphere is the arena of thought and action. It
seeks not the favor of the rich, nor the hand of the powerful, 
nor does it need the doctrinal skill of the philosopher,
nor the metaphysics of the metaphysician. Neither does
it lean upon the arm of kings and princes, nor the subtle
diplomacy of skilled statesmen. It seeks not the palaces of
the great and noble lords of earth, nor the hoarded treasures 
of the miser. It lives with, or without the sacerdotal
robe, and is often driven from the paraphernalia of priestly
<pb id="hols232" n="232"/>
dignity and ecclesiastic authority. It lives through the 
fiercest ordeals, sparkles in the furnaces of afflictions, coming 
out without the smell of fire upon its garments. It 
lives in caves and dells, sings from the tops of mountains, 
shouts from the lions' den, and presides in the gorgeous 
palaces of kings and princes. It thrives in the midst of 
famine, lives in the path of blood and revolution, and shines 
and glows in the luster of its own diamond brightness when 
civil and political systems perish and dance on to annihilation.

          <head>Amalgamation or Miscegenation.</head>
          <p>Nothing has such a tremendous and powerful influence
upon racial and human destiny in their final results, as to
national phases and political conditions, as the passions and
unbridled lusts of men. This is especially true of that class
or people that rules over another class or people. No 
matter how great the social chasm between the upper and the
nether people dwelling together in the same country or 
territory, the upper will seek the lower at that point of 
contactability and clandestine intercourse where there is 
mixing, The craving, heaving and impulsive passion of men,
goads them on to blacklisted indulgences that even racial
prejudices, many of which are stronger than death, cannot
restrain. Even when the two peoples live in separate climes,
divided by wide seas, high mountains and extended plains,
they will seek each other in that way so as to produce
another race and a new progeny. It matters not what 
distinctions, racial or national, there may exist between the
peoples dwelling together, those who are regarded as 
inferiors will be sought after and will be debased by the 
superior. They proceed upon the theory that those who are
already debased and contaminated cannot be more 
debauched or lowered in the moral scale than they are, and
therefore it is a matter of small import to add to the sum
of villainy, vileness and crime. Not that it is a crime for
the races to intermix according to the laws of the land, as
it may be done in almost all the countries on the earth; but
the way amalgamation has been brought about in these
Southern States is enough to make the bushmen in the wild
jungles blush with shame. There is nothing in amalgamation
<pb id="hols234" n="234"/>
sinful or wrong, providing it is legal, or done 
according to the laws of the land. So far as we can see, there 
is nothing in the nature of the different races of mankind 
to prohibit legal marriages between them. There is no real 
fundamental or inherent constitutional differences that can 
be urged as an objection. It is true that many claim that 
some races of men are constitutionally superior to others; 
that the white man is naturally, inherently, superior to the 
African and the Negro; that Indians, Malays and Chinese 
are really and constitutionally the deficient races, and cannot 
measure or cope with the <sic>Caucassian</sic> intellectually, and 
are therefore inferior in their creation. If they are 
inferior in their creation, then they are incapable of reaching 
that high moral intellectual status that seems inherent in 
the Caucassian. But there are many things connected with 
this question that contradict this position: 1. It is to be 
acknowledged that there are degrees of differences among the 
races of mankind; but these differences are conditional and 
circumstantial rather than constitutional. No man is born 
higher, purer, and better than another, so far as his real 
nature and the faculties of his humanity are concerned. 
One man may be superior to another in degree of learning, 
refinement and intellectual acquisitions; but this is in 
degree and not in kinds. The difference is the same as that 
which is between quantity and quality in any two given 
substances. The difference is not in the constituent 
elements that make up the one or the other, but in the degrees 
in the best elements that have the largest and most extended 
part in the substance. There is a great difference between 
the cultivated and the uncultivated mind, and in some 
instances there seems to be an almost infinite difference. 
That is, one seems almost infinitely above the 
other in degrees of mind culture and mental ability; 
but this does not show natural or native superiority.
<pb id="hols235" n="235"/>
It only shows superior training, higher culture, and
better conditions. The untrained and the uncultured
have as many faculties of the mind as the refined and the
intelligent. Both characters have the same mental and
metaphysical constitutions. The province of knowledge is
not to create, but to discover, or uncover and set in their
native light the things that are already in existence. It is
above the power of the human mind to create, or bring
from naught to being a single atom in the universe. If
new things appear to the learned and the cultured, they are
not new in their elementary parts, but new only in their
relations and discovery. That is, they existed and had their
relations to other things before they were seen by the mind,
or comprehended by the reasoning faculties. If it was
possible for one mind to create—to make substance from
nothing—and impossible for another mind to create, then
the former would be inherently and really superior to the
latter. Upon this hypothesis men would not be created free
and equal, but one constitutionally superior to the other.</p>
          <p>2. The highest culture, discovery and learning of those
whose ancestry have had superior advantages for centuries
(not excepting the greatest minds that have acted upon the
arena of life), have never been able to make or add a single
new faculty to the human mentality; but men have been
found in all ages and countries and nations and conditions,
to have the same kind of minds and the same number of
faculties, physical and moral. Whatever, therefore, is
possible for one man, is possible for the generality of men,
so far as their mental qualities are concerned. All the superior 
intelligence and the achievements of culture that are
apparent among men are not founded on a higher native
ability, but on the degrees of culture and intellectual
altitudes that have been attained by education and
training. They are the natural result of labor 
<pb id="hols236" n="236"/>
bestowed upon the mental man. Culture not only 
develops the mind and extends the domain of thought and 
widens the mental possibilities, but, as a natural 
consequence, the mental actions and the mental forces have much 
to do with the physical stature, both directly and indirectly. 
Directly, because the body is the outward or physical 
instrument of the mind. It acts as it is acted upon by the 
spiritual and living reality that dwells within. Ambition, 
desires and aspirations, like perturbation, melancholia and
hypochondria, all have their mighty and changing 
influences upon the physical and bodily proportions. Equally
is it true that joy, hope and anticipations, like angels, bring
the light of heaven upon their golden wings to the despondent 
and unhappy, physically as well as mentally. Indirectly, 
men are under attending influences of which they
are not always cognizant. Many things are done from the
force of habit, taste and custom, when there is no real
reason for it. Men are partakers of the influences that 
surround them in spite of any resistance which they may make.
Hence, one type of social and civic life may be easily 
engrafted upon another, until the former loses its identity in
the engulfing <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> of the latter; and what was once
two distinct phases of civil life becomes one unconsciously.
It is by this absorbing and assimilating process that all 
civilizations are to become one in fact, if not in type and
phase. The aims and bottom principles of civilization are
always the same, since they must act upon human 
nature with the same ends in view. Civic, social and religious
regeneration can only reach or attain its ends by this absorbing 
and assimilating process, and this process is accelerated
when the introduction of the better elements is made and
the evils are eliminated. Hence, men yield to the 
conditions that surround them, and yield unconsciously.</p>
          <p>3. If there were any real constitutional differences in the
<pb id="hols237" n="237"/>
races of mankind, the process of amalgamation could not
proceed at all. The great disparity between the very superior 
and the very inferior would prevent, on natural and 
philosophical principles, the possibility of a progeny. There 
could be no half-breeds, nor cross-bloods, nor mongrel races 
or peoples, but there would have been but one race; and 
that one race would have maintained its perfect identity 
and individualism through all the decades and centuries. 
Vile Sodomy, for which “the cities of the plains were 
overthrown,” has never yet produced a single man or woman, 
nor is it a thing that is possible to be done. “The reign of 
law and the unity of nature” forbid the monstrosity. This 
goes to show, not only the superiority of man over the 
beasts, but it shows also the unity of the human race.</p>
          <p>4. It is in the conception of mankind that “all men are 
created free and equal,” because the moral requirements, 
at least in civilized countries, are the same for all men. The 
same law that presides over the intelligent, the educated and 
the learned, presides over the ignorant, the uneducated and 
the unlearned alike. Ignorance of the moral and civic 
features of the law makes no difference whatever on
account of race, color, or condition. This is not only true as 
regards human laws, but the Divine government in its 
righteous requirements makes no difference in its application 
of the law on account of a man belonging to this, that 
or the other race. All are treated as equals before the law, 
in their punishments and in their rewards. From this it 
seems clear that if one race of men wore innately superior to 
another race then more than one law would have to be 
established and executed for the one in distinction from the
other. Or, if the same law, as now, is to be applied to all 
men, one race being superior to the other, then there must 
be degrees in the same law to be applied according to the
<pb id="hols238" n="238"/>
guilt or innocence of the persons concerned. But we see 
the beauty of human and divine law executed alike upon 
all classes and races of men with the same ends in view, 
namely, to preserve the government of God for the 
happiness of the universe.</p>
          <p>In the Southern States the colored man is treated and 
regarded as an inferior. The public conscience has been 
educated under distorted views and a vicious sentimentalism 
by which nearly all of his civil rights have been 
abridged, if not entirely destroyed; yet the shameful 
practice of illegal and damnable miscegenation goes on without 
let or hindrance. While we deplore this state of things, and 
while we know of no practical remedy, yet we believe that 
the hand of God will overrule it all in such a way as to 
promote the national and international harmony, peace and 
prosperity of universal man.</p>

            </salute>
          </opener>
          <p>It is with great pleasure and profound respect that I 
appear before you on this occasion. I count it an honor as 
well as a pleasure to meet and to greet those lofty characters 
and princely heroes who bear the name and do the work 
of Methodist preachers. They are not only princely and 
heroic, but they constitute the world's greatest, and the 
most active moral force that comes within the limits of 
human agency. In their reformative movements, they are 
like “the living creatures” of Ezekiel's wheels who run and
return at God's command, thread and ramify the zones of 
civil and uncivil man, filling the world with the light of 
God, the majesty of His love, and the splendors of His 
grace. It is by your grace and Christian charity that I 
shall attempt to speak to you upon a question of vital 
interest, both to your people and to mine.</p>
          <p>In 1882, the General Conference of the M. E. Church, 
South, authorized the establishment and maintenance of a 
school for the training of preachers and teachers for “the 
Colored Methodist Episcopal Church in America,” and
accordingly in the winter of 1883 the school was organized, 
and the Board of Trustees gave it the name of “The Paine 
Institute,” in honor of the then venerable Senior Bishop of 
the M. E. Church, South, who also, with the assistance of 
Bishop McTyeire organized the Colored branch of the 
Church, and ordained its two first Bishops. Augusta, Ga., 
was selected as the place of its location. For several years
<pb id="hols240" n="240"/>
the school was taught in rented houses, but by the fortunate 
turn of events we went near the suburbs of the city and 
purchased the place that we now have, a beautiful site of 
ten acres of ground on an eminence overlooking the beautiful 
city of Augusta. This place was the home of a wealthy 
citizen, and contained his residence and outer buildings, 
which were his barns and stables. These were fitted up at 
small cost for dormitories and recitation rooms. Here the 
school has been taught for more than twelve years, and 
here it is still being taught.</p>
          <p>Dr. Morgan Calloway, who was the Vice-President of 
Emory College, was its organizer and first principal, having 
as his assistant the Rev. George Williams Walker, of 
the South Carolina Conference, who has always been with 
the school, and is its present faithful and honored President.</p>
          <p>The establishment and maintenance of this school is the
official work of the M. E. Church, South, and the only 
official work which that great church is now doing for the 
Afro-Americans in this country. We have reached that 
period in its work and history where its facilities for 
continued service and usefulness must be enlarged or else the 
prosecution of its work must stop. A building is 
indispensable and absolutely necessary. Seeing this condition 
of things, the Board of Education of the M. E. Church, 
South, at its last session, “being fully persuaded of the 
imperative need of a new building at Paine Institute, 
Augusta, Ga., determined to undertake at once the erection of 
the new building,” and I have been sent out by that board 
and the Board of Trustees to solicit your aid and co-operation, 
that the great work of Christianization of the Negro 
race may be enlarged and continued by the Christian 
people of this country.</p>
          <pb id="hols241" n="241"/>
          <p>The greatest single factor in the happiness of universal 
humanity is ideal Christianity, and the greatest work that 
can be done by man is the propagation of its truths, and the 
practical application of its principles. You need no especial 
argument to prove this position to be scriptural, philosophical, 
and divine. Christianity is the people's religion, and 
comes to the great world as God's greatest gift to all the 
long centuries of suffering humanity. It belongs to man in 
the broadest sense and in its minutest and deepest 
application. It belongs to man in every phase of life, and 
in every phase and zone of his cosmopolitan character. 
It has like effects upon all the branches and divisions of the
human race. Zones and parallels, and the character of 
civil, and the modes of <sic>incivil</sic> life, may change the physical 
aspect of man, beast, and flower, but divine Christianity 
knows no change, but, like the rose of eternal truth, 
forever buds and blooms upon its own native stock, kissing 
the ages of God in its own diamond brightness. Everywhere 
Christianity is emphatically Christianity, and everywhere 
it is propagated and planted in its purest forms and 
highest ideals, it produces itself in its native plenitude, 
bringing forth the cornerstone of its expanding empire, 
crying, “Grace, grace unto it.” There is no work like that 
of human redemption. There is no avocation beneath the 
sun or amid the awful tread of the cycles that can be 
compared to it. Indeed, as we have said, the greatest work that 
man can do is that of seeking and saving the lost. Jesus 
Christ himself set the example when he came as the Apostle
of human salvation; for, says he, “The Son of Man is come
to seek and to gave that which was lost.”</p>
          <p>Whatever people, nation, or race, has Christianity in its
highest ideals and purest forms, it is to that extent responsible
to God and to humanity for the salvation of the world 
and the redemption of man. It is a joyous truth, as we
<pb id="hols242" n="242"/>
as an efficient agency, to solve all great problems, to reform
all civilizations, banish the errors of men, clear the moral
atmosphere of the pestilential seeds of falsehood and mental
debasement, and save all men from sin and that death
that never dies.</p>
          <p>On all great occasions, and in every crisis of evolving
humanity, it has met the demands at the threshold of 
conflicting elements, adjusted the jarring forces, and filled the
centers and ramified the expanding peripheries with its own
greatness and ineffable fulness.</p>
          <p>It is also a happy thought that Christianity knows no
distinction of race or color or previous condition. It knows
no racial lines nor national boundaries, but leaps the
continents, plays on the silver-crowned waves of the seas, kisses
the islands with the kisses of truth, sweeps the plains with
its wing of flame, spreading its heavenly insignia over all
the sorrowing sons of Adam and the weeping daughters of
Eve. But as human work or labor is the greatest factor in
the spread of the Gospel, and is the God-appointed method
of its propagation, all Christians are called upon to
contribute their quantum to the world's salvation.</p>
          <p>Christian Europe and Christian America are at present
the great receptacles of the Christian religion, the repositories
of “the truth,” and are the spiritual and physical
dynamos that must thrill the world with its propulsions
and redemptive entities and agencies. From what other
point of the compass, in the moral hemisphere, shall
Christianity gather its strength and radiate the circles and
traverse the lines of human development?</p>
          <p>The Negro is here and <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> he is here to stay. He is
an important part of the body politic. He belongs to it as
the foot or hand belongs to the human body. As such he
is a factor in the growth and development of this great
civilization. Providence placed him here on the American
<pb id="hols243" n="243"/>
continent, and has suggested no way for his exit or
elimination. Evidently he is here for a purpose. Slavery was
only the occasion by which he came. It was not the end.
Nay, God had greater ends in view. As there are
something like two hundred and fifty millions of heathens in
Africa, and as it seems evident that the educated and
Christianized black man is best fitted for the preaching of the
Gospel in “the Dark Continent,” so Christian America, out
of its eight or ten millions of Negroes, must produce that
massive band of ebony-hued heroes by whom their fatherland
is to be redeemed. More and more it seems apparent
that American slavery was providential. It matters not
how deeply hidden or intricate the threads and lines of
Divine Providence may appear to be in the human concepts,
one thing is clear, and that is the Negro race has lost
nothing by it, but has gained a thousand pounds sterling
where it lost a penny. It is true that the Master enslaved
himself, and was a slave of slaves, but the asperities of the
now defunct institution were struck off and wonderfully
mitigated by that beautiful and lavish hand of Christian
charity and evangelistic labors bestowed upon the sons and
daughters of Ham by the Southern Methodist people. The
Negro did not march out of slavery empty-handed, but,
like Israel of old, came out with the rings and jewels of a
better civilization, and with the crown of truth upon his
head, and with a wreath of grace upon his brow and the
golden cup of salvation in the mouth of his sack. He came
out with deep touches of your Christianity and flashes of
your civilization, and received an upward propulsion that
he could not have obtained in his native land.</p>
          <p>But emancipation did not abrogate moral obligation.
Relations were changed, but humanity and Christianity
remained intact, and the Negro is yet in the twilight dawn
of a Christian civilization. He still needs help. He needs
<pb id="hols244" n="244"/>
Christianity in purer phases and broader morality and
higher forms in its reformative and practical ends.</p>
          <p>We admire that noble spirit and broad Christian charity
that sends your heroic and consecrated men and women
flashing across the vasty deep to preach the Gospel in the
regions beyond. We admire and almost adore that Christ-like
devotedness shown by those who go or by those who
send. It is high, holy and angelic and resplendent with the
seraphic flame of love. This, it is clear, is your plainest
duty, and we thank God that you are doing it. Every day
you are preaching and singing to the heathens “the old, old
story of Jesus and his love.” You are sowing the vital
seeds of the vital truth in foreign lands, and the living
propagators are heralding the melodies of the redemptive
scheme, and unfurling the blood-stained banner of the
cross, and as the word of God cannot fail there must be
fruitage in approaching days; but here at your doors, in
your streets and lanes, in your great cities and rural
districts, are heathens who sit “in darkness” and “in the
regions and shadow of death,” that need your aid, and have
first claims upon your liberality and Christian charity. As
their representative, I come to rehearse and to reverberate
the thrilling and all-awaking Macedonian cry.</p>
          <p>But you know the Negro. He is no stranger to you.
He has been with you all along through the diversified and
changing decades of two hundred and fifty years. He is
still the laborer, the <sic>mudsill</sic> of society, and the crudest
part of the social fabric.</p>
          <p>In the early decades of the American empire of sovereign
and independent States, and when this now mighty empire
of States was an infant of days, the Negro stood by its
cradle, and helped it to break and unwind its swaddling
bands of childhood, and labored to crown its youth with
glory, and its manhood with a diadem of golden stars. He
<pb id="hols245" n="245"/>
has been and is still a powerful factor in the development
of this country, and the expansion of its civilization. His
strong arm felled the forests, dried the swamps, cleared the
bogs, threw the sunlight upon its shady dales, made the
deserts to blush with flowers, the fields to smile with plenty,
and threw up a royal highway for a triumphant civilization.
He clothed your daughters with scarlet, your sisters with
gowns of silk, and your queenly ladies and “high-born
beauties” with jewels, and pinned the wreath of diamonds
upon their brow. When the war came, and the flower of
the land were slain upon its high places; when blood flowed
and carnage and death swept the Southern tier of States;
when your fathers, sons, and brothers were at the front upon
the field of battle, the Negro stood by you. He planted the
fields, sowed and reaped, and bent with devotion and silent
energy over the plowshare, and made bread and clothing
for the armies and the defenseless mothers, sisters, and little
children at home. The black women—the sable daughters
of toil and of song—nursed your children, gave them the
milk of kindness from their own breasts, and with tender
care, and the soft touches of love, and the dulcet strains of
sweetest carols in cadence low, they sang the child angel
to sweet repose. In kitchen, hall, dining room, and sick
chamber, these black maidens of love and tenderness carried
the sunshine of God, filled ten thousand homes with hope
and comfort. Likewise “the brother in black” cared for
your sick, buried your dead, wept over your slain, and with
arms of iron and fingers of steel wrote angelic deeds of
kindness upon the open scroll of two centuries and a half.
The Negro shared in your sorrows and rejoiced in your
prosperity, and in the great civil onflow of the age he is
your armor-bearer. When freedom came, it came without
his seeking or any effort on his part, for it was in the divine
decrees that he should be free. Even then he did not
<pb id="hols246" n="246"/>
forsake you nor the land of his nativity, but regathered the
broken cords of an ancient civilization, and like the moving
phalanx of a great army, or the steady flow of the Nile,
he continued with the even tenor of his way. Nowhere
has he broken friendship with you, or left the old landmarks
of love and esteem. Though we are two distinct peoples,
or two great bands in one great nation, there is a common
interest and a common destiny. Whatever results may
come from such a combination, it must take place in our
common country. Whatever affects you, affects us.
Whatever advances your interest, must, in a greater or less
degree, advance ours. We live in the same zone, born on
the same soil, breathe the same vital air, drink from the
same streams, bask in the same sunshine, and in the silent
cities of the dead we shall dwell together until the trump
of the Archangel and the deep rolling thunders of the
judgment shall summon us to stand before the Great Judge of
all. We profess the same religion, read the same Bible,
sing the same songs. Indeed, your religion is our religion,
your church is our church, your God is our God, your
Christ is our Christ, your heaven is our heaven, and your
hell is our hell.</p>
          <p>You need our brawn and muscle; we need your brain and
culture. You need our sinews of brass and bones of iron.
We need your steady hand to prosecute the noble ends of
life, and the triumphs of a Christian civilization. You
have the mental force, we have the physical power, and I
come to plead for a combination of both, united in a grand
national manhood, so attuned and attenuated that the
national mechanism may play in harmony as the mechanism
of a great steam engine. Why not?</p>
          <p>Of course you know our church was organized by your
great church, and we delight to honor our parentage and
are proud of our origin. In 1870, we were “set up” as a
<pb id="hols247" n="247"/>
distinct and independent branch of the great Methodist
family by and under the authority of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, South. I understand that we were “set up”
and not “set off.” In no sense does this “setting up” business
destroy, neither was it intended to destroy the religious
inter-racial relation that had obtained in days of old. We
are the same sable sons and sable daughters whom your
noble sires and princely men taught the way of life, and
who the sugar zones, the rice belts and the cotton empires
of the South labored to make them sons and daughters of
the Lord Almighty. We are the “offspring,” the legitimate
ecclesiastical children of the church of which you are
representatives. We have kept “the faith once delivered to the
saints; and as yet” there “is no variableness nor shadow of
turning.” Radiating from the central sun of Wesleyan
Methodism, and glowing in the heat and activity of its
power, like an arrow from its bow we are striking off in
straight lines of truth and love, preaching the simple
Gospel of the Cross.</p>
          <p>The new building that is now in process of erection at
Paine Institute is to be called “The Haygood Memorial
Hall,” as a monument to that great man, who stood for so
many years as a wall of brass in the defense of the Negro
race in this country. In him, the Negro race had its
strongest, its broadest, its truest, and its most eloquent and
sincere friend. He was our Martin Luther, who with pen
and voice, and with the deepest flow of soul, stood at the
foot of the cross, and amid the declining decades of the
dying century wrote his theses and nailed them upon the
door of public opinion, and changed the tide of public
sentiment in this country in behalf of the Negro race. He is
not dead. He has only ascended to the city beyond the
stars of God, while his thundering theses, so ably advocated,
are ringing through the decades and over the surging waves
<pb id="hols248" n="248"/>
of the expanding civilization, appealing to the considerate
judgment, the patience and Christian charity of the Christian
people of this country. Negroes should build it monument of
steel to his precious memory higher than the <sic corr="Eiffel">Eifel</sic> tower,
covered with gold and tipped with diamonds.</p>
          <p>But there is a higher motive, a loftier impulse, to which we
appeal. The Negro is a man, an immortal soul. Like the balance of
the human race, he must be saved or lost. Christ died for him, as
he died for all others. He is within the limits of the covenanted
grace, a lost jewel carved out by the hand of God. He is an
indestructible, self-conscious entity, “made in the image of God.”
Thousands, if not millions, of them were preached to and taught
the way of life by the Southern Methodist preachers. They were
not wise, great or rich, neither could they fathom the profundities
of the intellectual deeps, or span the zones of thought,
philosophy and research, but they understood the spiritual power
and the essentialities of simple Christianity, and the power of
saving grace. Day by day, through the long years of sweat and toil,
their simple Christianity spoke to them in golden sentences, and
brought to them the cheering news of God and the joys of his
Christ. Tens of thousands lived in the truth of the Gospel, died
in the triumphs of a living faith, and on the burning wings of the
plantation melodies they swept the airy path of the ethereal
seas, and fled to heaven and to God.</p>

          <head>Religion.</head>
          <p>Whatever may be the various phases or aspects of religion
that have existed among the different branches of the human race,
and which present themselves for the consideration of the
thoughtful and philosophic, to be true in itself and of itself,
must be of one origin and of one nature. Not only is this true, but
all religion must spring from a common center, and must rest
upon the basic principles, strike the same chords in human nature,
and have the same ends in view, namely, to please God and to
benefit and bless intelligent natures in the highest possible
degree. Religion was not made for man, nor for angels; but men
and angels and all the high intelligences of the intelligent
systems were made for religion. Hence, there is a fitness of
corresponding adaptedness of the first and second subjects. This
view of the subject must be true since the ground principles of
religion are increatable and exist because of the nature of God
and the principles upon which His government rests. Form and
symbolism in religion have no real connection with its principles
and its inherent elements, Principles and natures have no forms,
although they are important agencies and powerful factors in
preserving, developing, and propagating original religious ideas.
Every form in religion at one time, and in some state or
condition, had a meaning and was a symbolic representation of
an impressive idea embodied in religion, whose intent and
purpose looked deeper than the mere surface. The digits are not
principles themselves any more than the rainbow is peace. The
former represents mathematical principles in the science of the
universe, while the latter is
<pb id="hols250" n="250"/>
an emblem, in its seven-fold arch, of pacification, founded upon
certain natural attitudes of matter. Both are mere representatives
of abstract ideas, while their material outlines are the sensitive
vehicles and exterior preservatives. So the symbolisms of
religion are the sensible or tangible representatives of deeper
truths or basic principles that lay in the realm of the abstract. All
things not only come from the center, but all things tend toward
the center. All actions, elements, and forces have objects and
ends to attain, although their threads of relations and infinite
intricacies, with their respective bearings upon the center and the
circumference are beyond the limit of human or angelic
concepts. In harmonious relations and mutual conditions, they
play on all the threads of infinite design to magnify their
functions in those depths, expansions, and altitudes where none
but the Infinite treads the golden sands or traverses the open seas
of limitless spaces, forcing the entities and activities to their
centers or designed ends. From this view, the principle and
fundamentals of religion lay beyond their symbols and are in the
central zone of the abstract. The commands of religion may not
always be understood by those who are commanded to obey its
precepts; neither does that class always understand the symbols
or reasons why, yet they must obey, because it is possible that
they have not the full capacity to understand the whole nature
and design, should they be explained to them. Perhaps,
also, there are things in the establishment and economies
of religion that none can understand, and in the notion
of the Deity and divine things, that none can comprehend;
therefore, obedience upon presumptive faith is the only
prerogative of intelligent activities. Accordingly religion
is of faith or reliances upon those subtle substances that
belong to the fundamentals in the abstract.</p>
          <pb id="hols251" n="251"/>
          <p>All ideas of God came from God, independent of the
creatures who received them. Their perfect ideals and
concepts are not only grounded in the dual nature of man, but
they are the perfect emanations of a full and perfect God or
perfect original. All the ideas of men and angels have their first
perfect parts in the Deity, and as they are grasped and
apprehended, they are woven into the warp and woof of creature
comprehension and must be obeyed. Everywhere the threads of
God and religion <sic>interramify</sic> all intelligent natures. It is God
that acts upon the sphere of being and pours Himself into the
activities of force and universal existence. We cannot hide from
God, nor from being, nor nullify the <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> of the self-consciousness,
and therefore must assume all the responsibility
that belongs to intelligent personalities. To obey the precepts of
religion is, therefore, to obey the law of our being and the laws
that govern all being. God is more obedient to the principles of
religion than men or angels. That is, the laws of righteousness
that He commands us to keep are binding upon Him in the
highest degree, as well as upon all the intelligent offsprings of
the universal system. He does not want us to do what He does
not do. He loves and obeys all righteousness. He requires us to
do nothing more, and we must do nothing less. Nothing is more
natural than religion, and nothing is more unnatural than
irreligion. There is no such thing as supernatural religion, if we
mean by that term that religion, in its nature, requirements, and
principles, is contrary to or above nature. It is not even
superhuman, nor superangelic except in its degrees and effects.
That is, no intellect nor mental capacity, God excepted, can
comprehend the depth and infinite scope of religion in those
endless and countless contingencies that operate in the
government of God. Religion's eternal and unending principle
begins in Deity, and lingers in the endless
<pb id="hols252" n="252"/>
cycles, uniting all the depths of being, intensifying their
forces and activities. In essence, native reality, and requirements,
religion is not only always the same, but is as universal and as
extensive as the peopled empire of God. It is the law of being,
the natural law of the intelligent creation, bearing upon all in a
greater or less degree. There is no heaven or hell, and no
punishment or rewards without it. To obey its precepts is heaven,
to disobey them is hell. The mental character is so constituted in
the eternity of its native elements that it carries hell and
disobedience together in the same bosom, while heaven and
obedience are always found in the same place. In short,
the fundamentals of religion are the moral code of the universe,
as well as the inherent law of being in its moral capacity, since
the moral nature has much, if not everything to do with, mental
purity and development. As the internal influences the exterior,
giving shape and tone to life, and ameliorating the public aspect
of society, so the moral force expands mentality, accelerating its
momentum toward the heaven of full capacity. The moral
universe is an inclined plane along whose highway countless
multitudes struggle up the steep ascent of development,
experiencing the wonderful transitions that lay in the road to
those galaxies of mental and moral acquisitions where the eldest
children of eternity are crowned and glorified in the “Father's
house of many mansions.” Onward the struggling multitudes and
spiritual caravans of the universe move, while sinking suns
and crushing systems perish, and cycles upon cycles pile, ages
crumble beneath the tread of the universal armies, marching to the
music of the spheres and the drum the ages. Progression, eternal
progression, is the order and law of being and intelligent natures,
and, consequently, perpetual evolution and struggle for
personal fitness and perfection.</p>

          <head>Southern Methodism and the Slaves.</head>
          <p>Living in the dimness or the days of slavery, few, if
any, could prognosticate the future as to the social,
political or religious outcome of the system of American
slavery that then prevailed in the “Union of States.”
However unrighteous or repugnant to a Christian civilization
the institution seems to have been, and whatever
changes have come over the public mind since its abolition,
one thing is clear, and that is, the Negro race has
lost nothing by it, but has gained a thousand pounds sterling
where it has lost a penny. It was one of those mysterious
acts or permissions of the Divine administrations
whose complicated connections and results we could not
comprehend, but one in which was displayed the wisdom,
power, and goodness of Him who doeth all things well.
It is a trite saying, “all is well that ends well.” It is a
case where it seems that disease upon the body politic
was necessary to heal. Both parties—the slave and
slave-holder—were at fault. For some sins unknown to us in
the Hametic line, perhaps coming down through the centuries
of awful sweep, culminating in national dissolution
and tribal confusion, the black man of Africa, when
his iniquities came to the full had to suffer; and for every
transgression the God of nations demanded principal and
interest. The debt had to be paid, for “the wages of sin
is death.” But in enslaving the Negro, the master enslaved
himself, and was himself a slave of slaves. His
in the final settlement—God being the arbiter—was
more, perhaps, than that of the man of black skin. But
the system of slavery was wonderfully mitigated, and a
heavy percentage of its asperities struck off by that beautiful
and lavish hand of Christian charity and evangelistic
<pb id="hols254" n="254"/>
labors bestowed upon the slaves by the Southern Methodists.
Everywhere the sons and daughters of Ham were preached to,
looked after, and sought out by a class of Methodist preachers
with a care and pure simple devotion that were angelic,
heavenly, and unparalleled in the annals of Christian charity and
Christ-like devotion.</p>
          <p>In those days there were intellectual giants and blazing seraphs
of oratory whose piety was deep, all-spreading and bright as the
morning star. None of them were afraid or ashamed to preach the
gospel to Negroes. There was nothing like the simple gospel in
those days, and nothing more beautiful and consistent than those
faithful and true Negro veteran Christians that were the fruit of
those great and noble men's labors for the salvation and
Christianization of the Negro race. When the war came the Methodist
Episcopal Church, South, had more than two hundred thousand
persons of color in her membership, besides there was a large
number of Sunday-schools, in which the best blood, both male
and female, engaged in catechising and teaching the young
Negroes the simple and fundamental principles of the gospel.
Thousands of churches were built especially for the colored
people, and often a pastor was sent to them as to the whites.
Sometimes the Negroes got the best preacher and the most
talented man. No matter what Methodist Church has come into
the Southern States, it has simply built on the old foundation laid
by “the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.” That church justly
claims the ground against all comers, all invasions and invaders.
It laid the foundation deep, strong, and wide, upon which all
subsequent buildings have been reared as religious and
intellectual institutions established for the elevation and
advancement of the Negro race. Every question has two sides to
it, and whatever may be said about slavery and slaveholders does
not concern us at present. To recall the past with its sleepy
memories of strife and bitterness,
<pb id="hols255" n="255"/>
recasting its shapeless forms into post-bellum thought, and thus
confusing and confounding the present, is not only unwise and
suicidal, but detrimental and obstructive to the progress of the
colored race in too many ways to be mentioned. The earnest,
consecrated and noble Southern men who proclaimed the gospel
of salvation to the aspiring sons and daughters of Ham, were
doing all they could under prevailing conditions, and the
established laws, customs, and institutions of the land. Neither
did they whine, nor sulk in the tents of idleness, nor consult the
whimsical in human nature; but they consecrated their lives, their
ease, and wealth, and, as apostles of the fullest and freest
salvation, went forth to the black sons of Ham and founded
enduring monuments to their greatness, and built a power-house
of strength whose living and propulsive energies still thread and
thrill the evangelistic forces and redemptive activities of all
denominations. It may be truly said that the simple Christianity
impressed upon the Negro race by these men of God in ante-bellum
decades was the purest, the sublimest, and the most
apostolic since the days of Pentecost, <sic corr="vying">vieing</sic> with that of the
Waldenses, the Huguenots, and those devoted Piedmontese who
dwelt in their rock-bound land of the skies. There were Christians
in those days. Black men and white men, black women and white
women, lived for God and heaven, and the pure and simple Christ
of the New Testament was the only most exalted and consummate
ideal of the Christian life, while his death of perfect resignation
was the plenary gauge by which they died. While other
denominations helped to some small degree in preaching the
Gospel to the slaves, yet the Methodists led the way, cleared the
ground, and burnt the stubble with the ardent flames of love and
sacred, far-reaching devotion that was pure, splendid and heroic.
By their preaching and evangelistic labors, thousands, if not
millions, of Negroes lived and died in the <sic corr="ecstasies">ecstacies</sic>
<pb id="hols256" n="256"/>
of a living faith, and in “the mysterious translation,” that
awful flight to the celestial center, they fled on the burning
wing of the plantation melodies to hymn in eternal
anthems that Saviour preached to them by the Southern
Methodist preachers.</p>

          <head>The Papacy.</head>
          <p>Whatever may betide the peace, the happiness, and the
development of man in the onward trend of his civilization;
whatever civil forms, social aspects, or religious
tendencies may claim the attention of mankind, one of
the most powerful and potent agencies that is to influence
the destiny of nations is that wonderful and aged organization
known as the papacy or the Catholic hierarchy.
While we have no hatred or malice toward any man or
set of men because of their church, faith, or religious
opinions, yet, because of the doctrines, claims and fearful
record of the Catholic church, it presents to-day, as of
old, a profound study and the deepest concern. It is not
denied that there are millions of honest hearts, pure souls
and good Christian people in that church. Throughout
its long tramp through the ages, amid the birth and death,
of years and the mutations of centuries, many of its
<sic>hehoic</sic> devotees and pronounced followers have stood as
monuments of honor, piety and virtue. Many of its
sainted heroes and majestic apostles shine in the galaxy
of blazing suns and golden stars with an enduring and
unfading lustre that shall outlast the roll of years and
the flight of centuries. Their ancient priests with rosary
and cross have traversed sea and land, and stood among
the evanescencies and reversions of states and empires,
and with tenderness and love have sought to bind up the
broken-hearted and dry up the tears of the widow and
orphan. They have stood amid contagions, epidemics and
the wide sweep of endemics and the wild play of even “the
black death.” In the track of blood and revolution, and
the debris of broken kingdoms and shattered empires,
they have remembered the sons of toll and the daughters
of misery.</p>
          <pb id="hols258" n="258"/>
          <p>The papal regime has produced scholars, poets, states, men,
historians, inventors, explorers, lawyers, doctors, philosophers,
discoverers, painters, and sculptors. Thus far the papacy has been
an aid to mankind in his betterment and the expansion of the
world's civilization. But perhaps one of the most noticeable and
distinguishing characteristics of the papacy's history and
procedure is its skill in art and sublimity in architecture.
Grandeur in style, loftiness in dignity, and immensity in height
and extent, are the ponderous faculties by which the multitudes of
its blind and besotted devotees are overshadowed and awed into
a profound reverence that makes the physical church everything,
the invisible spirit of Christianity a little thing, and the freedom
of the people nothing. Mountains of superstition rise, the church
is greater than Christianity, and the Roman See the only lord and
potentate. If there are seven wonders of the ancient world and
seven wonders of the modern, the papacy is seven times more
wonderful than each, and in its stability and blind assumption
stands out in greatness and singleness of a sublimity that has
awed the masters of the world. The multitudes of its followers
eschew reason, surrender the rights of conscience, and
implicitly obey the iron mandates and cosmopolitan edicts of
the Roman See. In other words, the church is everything,
principles and people nothing. As an organized institution, all the
rights of conscience and the rights of men and nations are held
subordinate to the rule, usages, history and doctrines of the
church. Throughout its wide sway and long reign it has presumed
to be the only church on earth, and the Pope is the <sic>vicegerent</sic> of
Christ, the master of states and empires, the ruler of kings as
well as the supreme ruler and pontiff of the universal church.</p>
          <p>Now, it is not the individual persons of the Roman Catholic
church that Protestant nations fear, neither can
<pb id="hols259" n="259"/>
any reasonable man who believes in religious liberty and
freedom of speech and conscience object to the church nor its
peculiar doctrines and forms of worship. Every man is free, and
ought to be free, to select any church, believe any doctrine, or
espouse any form of worship which seems right to him. But this
freedom certainly gives no license to go to the extent of
interfering with the rights, privileges, and freedom of others,
and when the church, so-called, attempts to limit or prescribe the
faith and consciences of men, it becomes non-churched, and
claims more authority than Jesus Christ himself. None but God,
the Master and Supreme Ruler of the universe, can dictate to the
consciences of men or prescribe their religious proclivities and
aspirations. Eternal conformity to established forms of
religious obligations, based on the mere demands of
ecclesiastical legalism, is in no sense religion nor Christianity.
To bow the knee and subscribe to dogma, leaving the heart
untouched and the conscience unmoved, is not only irreligious,
but is also the basest form of Pharisaism, a profane prostitution
of the noblest powers of manhood and the sacred functions of
religion.</p>
          <p>From whatever standpoint we view the Catholic hierarchy, it
presents to the considerate mind marvels that approximate the
miraculous. To the superficial view it has the appearance of a
perpetual and continuous miracle. It has a wonderful amount of
tact, and an extent of versatility and adaptedness of strategem
that surpass anything that has occurred in the historic
transactions of men. It lives while it is dead, and is dead while it
lives. The defeats, repulsions and deadly wounds which it has
received from the edicts of governments and acts of
reformations, have never destroyed it, nor even paralyzed its life
and energies. After all its baptisms of blood and fire, it has risen
from the ashes of its death, stood upon the brink of its grave and
smiled in triumph
<pb id="hols260" n="260"/>
in the face of its powerful foes. It yields for a time in meek
submission to Protestant thrones, reserving its latent forces and
energies to rekindle its fires upon the expanding arenas of
advancing civilizations. It is always, rising and coming amid
changeful evolutions and eventful dispensations. It is ever the
same in design, but ever changeful in its methods to reach its
ends. Its <sic corr="propaganda">propoganda</sic> is unscrupulous, besotted, superstitious and
full of that blind bigotry that knows nothing but to demand
obedience to the papal head. Its slogan is: “The means are sanctified
by the ends.” It is not a question of holiness and purity of the
public morals, and freedom of the conscience, but with them the
only question is, the extension of the Roman See and papal
authority. In its lust for power and greed for universal conquest,
anything and everything is right, and nothing is worth redemption
but the church and the iron rule of the supreme Roman pontiff.</p>
          <p>Romanism is a factor in human history, government and
progress. Its effects and influence upon the political status of
nations and kingdoms is weighty, far-reaching, and immense in
results. It is the greatest antagonist of freedom of speech, of a
free press and of a free religion. It is a grand oligarchy, with
immense force and push—with cunning and skilful intrigue—in
whose plenipotent fingers the threads of the universal octopus
centralizes its splendid capabilities in a papal head.</p>
          <p>The Roman Catholic church is incapable of progress except so
far as it is necessary to preserve the church. It antagonizes higher
education for the masses, and is a deadly foe to the public school
system unless the public school system is entirely and completely
under the control of the priests and bishops of the Catholic regime.
Ignorance and mental darkness (with them) is better than light and
freedom of thought and investigation by the masses better than
that education that reaches those
<pb id="hols261" n="261"/>
degrees of mental endowments and capacities, where the
enlightened manhood may think for itself. It is a curious fact
that the so-called “Church of God” should be afraid of the light
of knowledge and the keenest investigation by an intelligent
citizen. If it is “the true church of God,”
and is the pillar and ground work of the truth, why should it
fear investigation? Truth has nothing to fear, but invites the
keenest investigation and the profoundest criticism. There must
be something wrong in the men or those doctrines and
establishments that are afraid of calm review and the crucial test
of keen criticism. If it is afraid to be weighed in the judgment of
men and measured by the legal tests of enlightened reason, then
it must have something about it that is inconsistent with the best
interests and the highest aims and aspirations of man.</p>
          <p>But it is certain that the nations of mankind have a subtle,
schemeful and powerful foe to deal with—a foe whose gigantic
arm of power sweeps the seas, grasps the islands with an iron
grip; and wraps the belted zones of human civilization in the
meshes of its nimble fingers, and with cords of steel and bands of
iron ties them on to the papal car. Papal diplomacy is the most
skilled and artful, and full of that cunning and manipulation that
plays on human nature and pours itself into its superstitions,
thrilling its religious faculties with the grandeur, augustness and
bright paraphernalia of its orders and the tinsilized symbolisms
of its public worship and service. Romanism claims all the
churchism and prelatical authority that is worth claiming. There
is nothing true, heavenly and divine, but that that is from the
Roman See, or emanates from the pope and his great conclaves.
His bulls, encyclicals and edicts, as <hi rend="italics">excathredra,</hi> are the
essence of unerring mandates and infallibility, and <hi rend="italics">“the high <sic corr="arcana">arcanna</sic>”</hi>
of “the Most High” is profanely assumed by the Bishop of Rome.</p>
          <pb id="hols262" n="262"/>
          <p>No man of common judgment, with any degree of acquaintance
with the history of the Roman church, doubts the sagacity, the
wisdom, the farsightedness of its popes, premiers, statesmen,
cardinals, bishops and leaders. They have astonished the world
with feats of diplomacy and an eternal series of brilliant intrigues
that seem at times to be almost superhuman. Its 150,000,000 of
devoted followers embraces all nations, and the sun never sets
upon this politico-religious empire of the Roman pontiff. He is
the highest ruler and the greatest king on earth,, and the only one
that wears the triple crown and dictates to the hearts and
consciences of men.</p>
          <p>But the most fearful thing connected with this gigantic
power is its claims to universal power and authority,
both in church and state. This is not only a spiritual, but
political kingdom as well. The Pope claims all the kingdoms
of the world, and looks forward to the day when he
alone shall hold all crowns in his hand, and wield the
golden scepter of universal sway, and dictate to all
the governments of the world. The church of Rome
wants nothing less than supreme political power. It will
be contented with nothing short of it, and wherever and
in whatever part of the habitable earth it shall gain this
power, it will persecute and seek to accomplish by physical
force what it cannot do by moral suasion. Where
it has the control, it will not hesitate to resort to cruel
tortures upon the wheel and the rack, and by fire and
sword, put to death thousands and even millions who may
dissent from its teachings and usages. This accords with
its history and practice through its steady march of it
thousand years, and there are no signs or probability of
a change of doctrine, nature or practice. It is true, at
present, its endeavors to put on a decent appearance and
hold its political aspirations in abeyance, and politely
bows to “the powers that be,” but it is the same old
bloody Monarch and gay beast that has scattered the
<pb id="hols263" n="263"/>
bones of innocent men and women through its long reign
of tyranny, persecution and death. Its “Spanish Inquisitions,” its
great court of death, has written its history in blood and
reddened the soil with human gore. Nowhere in the annals of
human history has there been presented to men, devils, or
angels, greater cruelties and a more shocking, diabolical regime
than those of the hellish and damnable Court of the Inquisition.</p>
          <p>The enormity of vileness, the plenitude of the outflow
of blood and tears, the multitudes of the slain and the
valleys of bleaching bones, the dark, damp pits and rock-bound
dungeons, the weeping widows and sighing orphans,
and the burning highway and smoking track of
this so-called church of God, is enough to put a tingy
blush upon the cheeks of the world's civilizations and
make mankind forever hate and execrate this blood-thirsty
Moloch of the centuries. All this, too, is done in the
name of the religion of love, and in the name of and for
that meek and lowly Son of Mary that died on the cross
to save the world of sinners. If the Roman hierarchy in
its history and practice during ages past is a true exponent
and illustration of Christianity, then the world is
infinitely better off without it, and its utter annihilation
or total banishment from the abodes of men will be not
only a riddance of intolerable evils in the name of God
and man, but also a blessing of unmeasured depth and dimensions.
To-day, as of all days, she is laying plans, forging chains for
the sixty millions of American freemen and
American Protestantism, and doing it in a way so as to
excite as little apprehension and uneasiness as possible.
Quietly and silently she is stealing the hearts of men,
proselyting and adding converts to her already enormous
membership of nine millions of duped and devoted followers.
Great schools and immense churches, nunneries and
cathedrals rise in splendid trim and tower upon their
mighty foundations in the heart of empire, holding the
<pb id="hols264" n="264"/>
hub of American life and civilization in embrace and belting its
arenas with its iron arm of power. Representatives, senators and
presidents, with governors of states, mayors of great cities and
councilmen, are bowing the knee, making concessions and
confessions, and finally kissing the big toe of the Pope. “What
fools we mortals be!”</p>
          <p>One of these mornings the American people will awake to find
themselves fettered and chained and bound hand and foot and
made to do homage to the Roman See. What is the remedy? How
shall the encroaching power of this mighty octopus be curtailed?
Who can stand before the beast? We would reply by saying that
there is no power on earth that can stop this encroachment of
Rome but the civil power, and that can only be done while the
mighty Roman pontiff is in the minority. In great Britain, in
Germany and the United States of America, Roman Catholicism
is making rapid progress, especially in England. And, so far as we
can see, she is doing much more to bring the world to herself
than all of Protestantism is doing to bring the world to Christ.
Everywhere she is earnestly, if not honestly, at work to conquer
the world for the papal head, and to bring universal humanity
under the control of the Pope. As in Britain and Germany, so in
America, special efforts are being made to reach a safe majority
in political influence and to control the public school system of
the states and municipalities. The public press, which should be
free, impartial and untrammeled as moulders of thought and
public opinion, are cringing, bowing and scraping, and making
concessions to a power whose aim is to make slaves of the souls
and bodies of men and tread and crush the nations of man beneath
the iron heel of the greatest despot that ever sat upon an earthly
throne or reigned over an empire. It is truly astonishing when we
see great men—senators, governors, renowned writers, Protestant
ministers, political parties, and the mighty men of the
<pb id="hols265" n="265"/>
nation—allowing, and even encouraging, the growth and
expansion of a power that is seeking to destroy their liberty
and reduce them to a foreign monstrosity nominally
Christian, yet truly and intensely political.</p>
          <p>Viewing this whole question from an impartial standpoint, we
see a fearful conflict approaching—a conflict between the
Catholic power and the civil power—unless there is at
Work beneath the trend of events some unknown element or
force that will set bounds to Popish aspirations and the subtle
intrigue of the Roman See. Of course, this is a Protestant
country at present, and a government of the same phase, but it
may not be so very long. Evidently two diverse elements and
powers, or two antagonistic forces, are moving beneath the civil
and religious surface, and there are indications of an increased
ratio of procedure and concentration, or an intense aggregation
of opposing elements and forces. So greatly are these forces and
elements being intensified that agitation is continuous, and at the
end of another decade there may be an explosion of the internal
fires of the civic order. Protestants will have to fight for liberty,
government and religion, and as the strife is to be internecine
and intensified by the freedom of conscience on the one hand,
and the blind and bigoted assumptions of the Roman pontiff on
the other, the conflict will be short but fearful, bloody and
dreadful beyond description, compared to which the French
Revolution will be a baby. In the meantime the same sort or
similar forces are at work in England and Germany, and the
results, in the culmination of events, may be very much the
same. At any rate, it seems clear, not only in prophetic vision, but
in the quiet contemplation of the thoughtful, that something will
soon have to be done to check the encroachments of the Roman
church and save the people of several nations from a flow of
blood unparalleled in the history of the world, and unanticipated
by the wisest of mankind.</p>

          <head>The Image of God in Man.</head>
          <p>Whatever else may exist in the human personality, apart from
its tangible attributes and component elements, it has in some
way the image of the Absolute Intelligence. That intelligence is
more than coextensive with matter which must within itself live
above and beyond its own material creations. No matter how
extensive and calculable the tangible parts of the universe may
appear to human conception, there are no faculties possessed by
man or any other created intelligences to measure its depths and
heights and weigh its imponderable masses. Everywhere we look,
conceive, or think, thought quails before the wonders, powers,
forces, infinite varieties, and majesties amaze us. In this category
of splendors, this endless chain of wonders, there dwells a
“soulful life,” a splendid and all-subduing actuality, whose
potentialities are infinitely absolute. For the want of a better
name, or rather the want of a capacity in man to use a better
name, we call it God. In this image man is made. In Genesis it is
declared that “God created man in his own image—in the image of
God created he him; male and female created he them.” St. Paul
tells us that “he is the image and glory of God.” St. Paul makes the
“glory” here referred to an attribute of “the image.” The glory is
not the “image” of the Great Original, but is a product of that
original. There is a “glory <hi rend="italics">of</hi> God” and a glory <hi rend="italics">in</hi> God. The
former is a product “of God,” the latter is an attribute, or an
inherent quality, or part of his being or nature. If there is a seen
and tangible universe, there must be an unseen and intangible
universe, and the former must be the product of the latter. In
other words, the unseen must have produced or brought
<pb id="hols267" n="267"/>
into being the seen and the thinkable. Thus “In the
beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” The
earth is a part of the seen, also the heavens that shine
above us. But the Creator, or the invisible Universe,
must be forever hid from man and all his intelligent
associates. Now an image is the likeness of a thing either
in form or substance, or in both, but not in the sense that
the image is a part of or a dissepiment of the original.
In that case there could be no image at all. It would
simply be a part of the original, or a part of the first part,
and not a product or creation of the first part. The possibility
of making a perfect likeness of a thing in kind, possessing
the same elements and attributes of the original,
is an indispensable faculty or power that belongs to, and
must inhere in the Creator alone. None but God can
create, and the creative fiats and acts can only proceed
from this unseen Intelligence that was always the unthinkable,
the unknowable, and infinite embodiment of
concepts that had no time, place, or condition from which
to start into being. This is the universal Original in
whose “image” man is made. To be made “in the image
of God,” is the only possible way that man and all intelligent
creatures can be, or could have been, made or created.
Angels and men, all spirits, whether they be in
heaven, on earth, or in hell, or in any other part of the
habitable spheres of the universe, are made “in the image
of God,” and therefore are like man, or man is like
them. They are images of one another, just as a thousand
photographs drawn from one face at one sitting are images
of that face. Each one of the thousand is precisely
like every other one of the nine hundred and ninety-nine.
If there were but one man in the universe, and these one
thousand images were the likeness of his face, and if this
man should die and all his pictures be lost or burned in
the flames, it would be impossible to reproduce them except
from the negative, or the glass plate upon which his
<pb id="hols268" n="268"/>
face was formerly photographed. This is the original from
which all the thousand photographs were taken. Let us particularly
note the fact, that every one of these thousand photographs was
exactly alike in their fundamental outlines and constituents. In
other words, every single one of them would correspond to or
have those characteristics that distinguished the face from which
it was taken; and every one, to all intents and purposes would be
an image of that man. If any of them should become blurred or
soiled, that would be a condition, and would have nothing to do
with the fundamentals. It is still a photograph, although soiled and
changed in the externals, and, in that sense, is bleared or dimmed,
but not lost.</p>
          <p>The mind of the universe is a mirror. It reflects and absorbs
images. If an angel flies through the skies, he is mirrored in the
deep track of space, and in the deeper, broader, and perfectly
receptive mind of God. An angel or man may blend in the most
subtle ether, or in the most attenuated elements of the nebulæ, but
he is himself still, and is the same in image, and consequently
retains his personal reality to that degree where he is forever
himself and eternally no other self.</p>
          <p>Every man is photographed in the absorbent universe, both in his
mental and physical personal outlines. He is not only the highest
(God excepted), but also a distinct rationality, equal in mental
quality, if not in degree, to any other intelligence that inhabits the
spheres of the universe. Everywhere man is man. Conditions dwarf
his mental stature, or enlarge it, blear or clarify it, but do not,
because they cannot, change his real self and vital humanity.
Paradise, nor hell, nor the corrosions of centuries can have any
effect upon the innate possibilities of mind, because that is the
image of its Creator, and the only possible image of the Creator
that can be made or can exist. God made man in His “own
image,” because
<pb id="hols269" n="269"/>
there was in the nature of things no other way to make him. To be
was to be made this way, and not to be made this way was not to
be made at all. This brings us to the conclusion that man, like all
other intelligent creatures, was finished in the fiat act that gave
him the birth of his being. He was finished in his creation, and in
those higher and deeper finalities where he became a living soul
or an intelligent actuality. His nature is full-orbed in all those
essentials upon which all subsequent possibilities must rest. If
this is not so, then there must have, been not only one creation,
as in the first fiat act of his being, but there must still be
subsequent creations and consequently additions to his being,
and soon the real self must become another self, and a distinct
<hi rend="italics">ego</hi> from the original personality. This would not only destroy
the nature of man, but it would unbalance the unseen universe,
subvert “the unity of nature and the reign of law.” Men and
angels, and all the intelligences of the universe, would lose their
identity of character and their moral responsibility.</p>
          <p>Neither do actual developments nor possibilities imply a
change in the fundamentals of being. These simply imply
progress, those intellectual expansions where new conditions are
attained. On these lines and principles there may be infinite
lengths, depths and heights. There are broad areas for the mental
force. They are open and clear for the eternal transitions of
mind. Indeed, our mental humanity may not only have the power
of perpetual development in endless space, but for all that
we know there may be sleeping forces and even latent faculties
that have not as yet reached those planes in evolution and
those arenas in endless progression where they are needed
in the mental sphere. All the powers of nature used for the
improvement of mankind are not new energies or forces in
themselves, but old forces and energies newly discovered, and
together with new combinations
<pb id="hols270" n="270"/>
and new uses they make up the discoveries of
science and the inventions of civilization. Steam and
electricity are as old as creation, and ether is as old
as the heavens in which it floats, and all minerals
were here from the foundation of the world. So nothing
in creation is new in itself. If, then, man is made
“in the image of God,” and that image is the mental
constitution, then all the intellectualities of the universe
are images or photographs taken from the same negative,
or, in other words, made like God. But they are made like
God how? Man is not made like God in his physical properties,
nor those delineations of his material embodiment
that we call the body. As yet there is nothing discovered
in science to prove the truth of the doctrine of anthropomophism.
“God is a spirit, and they that worship him
must worship him in spirit and in truth.” This is not
only a declaration of Holy Writ, but is a scientific
certainty and an absolute necessity. God cannot be God
unless he is spirit or mental individualism, including all the
faculties of the universal intelligence. He can be nothing
lower and nothing less than spirit or mind, and we
are taught that he has neither shape nor form, nor bodily
parts. That is, if he has these faculties at all, they are
on a plane too high and exalted to be conceived by His
intelligent offsprings. In the very nature of the
metaphysical universe, we cannot see or handle spirit any
more than we can see or handle thought. It exists everywhere
as the all-pervading life and activity of the universe,
but nowhere, so far as our knowledge goes, has it
any perceptible parts or tangible properties. Rising
higher and incumbent upon all space and all things therein
contained, spirit is the finest, the most subtle and
attenuated substance that can possibly be. While it is the
highest form of existence possible, yet it exists, not only
independent of all other things and beings, but because it cannot
cease from existing. In other words, the
<pb id="hols271" n="271"/>
universal intelligence cannot become annihilated, because it is not an
entity in the sense that it ever began. It had no time, place, or
conditions upon which to enter. It was here before all entities. It
is the entirety of the unbeginning and universal actuality, whose
qualities and altitude of faculties are too high to be reached by
others.</p>
          <p>The moral sense is only a part of the mental. If man loves,
hates, obeys, or fears, it is the action of the human mentality,
and not anything separate and distinct from it.</p>
          <p>All of the mental natures of the universe are alike in the
constituent elements of their being. Not only are they alike in
this particular, but they are alike because they are made in the
image of the Creator. This being the true metaphysical nature of
beings in the sphere of life, all are related to each other, not only
because they are the common inhabitants of a common universe,
but especially because they are made in the same image in their
mental constitution, and of the same substance. There exist
between them the closest, the nearest, and highest function of
affinity and kinship. Angels, devils, men, and all the intelligent
inhabitants of the universe, whether they have fallen from any
state of purity, or kept their state of obedience and happiness, are
all our nearest and dearest brothers. All are of the same Father,
possessing in common the same nature, with all that is in implied in
the term. Adam was the father of his children, but not the father
of their spiritual humanity. Spirit can only come from spirit.
Flesh can beget flesh, but it cannot beget spirit or mental
humanity. This is God's specific work, and belongs in the realm
of the spiritual. The views here presented are substantiated from
the facts of history, respecting man's nature in all ages, nations
and conditions. In the fundamentals of human nature, Asiatics,
Europeans, Africans, Americans, with all the people of Oceania,
no matter how distinct in their habits and customs, present to
the considerate judgment
<pb id="hols272" n="272"/>
of all the same proclivities and mental aspects. The climate and
the modes of life may change the color of the skin, distort the
features, giving the whole physique an appearance of marked
differences, but still the mental nature remains the same in all. If
it can be shown that there have been several creations of man, or
that the family of man had different starting points in their lower
physical generation, yet this would not affect the human relation
in any of its phases, nor destroy that intimate kinship that of
necessity belongs to all intelligent creatures. No individual can
evade or destroy the duties and relations which the constitution
of his being imposes upon him, any more than he can get out of
the universe. There is no way in the nature and fitness of things
for any mental character to get off the spheres of being and
responsibility any more than he can get out of himself or the
eternal <hi rend="italics">ego.</hi> As a citizen, he is one, and only one, but all of one,
and can never be any less than one, or any less than the present
self. The image of God cannot be lost or annihilated. The
individuals themselves, whether men, angels, or devils, have no
power or capacity to bring on total death to their mental being or
destroy their personal identity. Mirrored in the universe, and
engraved upon the potentialities of the eternal possibilities of
the spiritual activities, each one of us shall ascend the scales
and planes of evolution, transition and development, through
long ages to come, forever retaining the image
of God and the conscious self.</p>

          <head>The Trend of Civilization.</head>
          <p>Whatever may be the distinctions of one race from another in
the qualities and inherent elements that constitute those
distinctions, there is one civilization and one common destiny
for all the human race. In essential qualities and characteristics,
mankind is one and the same. The different phases of social,
civic, and individual life that have presented themselves to the
consideration of the student of history and philosophy are mere
ramifications that radiate from the same centers, or parent stems.
The foundation of civilization is found in the nature, conditions,
necessities, and aspirations of men. Because of the desire to
better his condition and to make the way of human life pleasing
and joyous, he seeks to bend the powers of nature to his wants and
coerces its forces and agencies along those lines and planes that
will produce the greatest amount of those results by which he
ascends the altitudes of civilization. The very construction of his
native constituency that permeates “the human form divine”
involve those agitative and sleepless precipitants that ever stir,
stimulate, and woo him on to investigate, to weigh, and measure
principles of the universe that draw his chariot from the individual
center to the impalpable periphery. Man is nothing if not
agitative and exploring. The mental attributes are the restless
aggregates of divine sunbeams formed into the sphere of mind
whereby man seeks those lofty climes and grasps those splendid
qualities which make men become as gods, “knowing good from
evil.” To what extent the elements of nature and the mental and
physical forces of the universe may be made to serve and develop
the earthly side of humanity or to develop mankind as we see it in
this state of being,
<pb id="hols274" n="274"/>
can only be determined by the output of the ages and the
wonders of the cycles. Like the universe around us, nowhere
does man stand still. He is coming and going, living and dying,
rising and falling, ascending and descending, on the ladder of
evolution, dissolution and revolution. He springs forth to the
depth of his own center, and from it rebounds to the utmost
limits of his hemisphere, widening his own sphere of action and
mental ebullitions, gaining every step he takes towards the great
center of a unified and common civilization. What is wonderful
to-day may be lost as insignificant to-morrow, and the raindrops
of the morning may be the cloudbursts of the night. In the mental
and physical immensity human expansion, in degrees of civilized
life, is in its infancy. Its greatest possibility lies in the
undiscovered depths of metaphysical science. There are latent
forces whose vital cords are still untouched by the occultist or
the metaphysician. There are gems of thought and jewels of
wisdom in the bays and gulfs and deep seas of the manhood of
humanity that shall be set to “the music of the spheres” and the
song of the ages, in the day of their coronation amid the jubilees
of an all-conquering, centralized, and unified civilization. All
things move toward the center. It is the generous, free, and full
combination of the elements and agencies that deify humanity
and make men princes and kings, and women and little children
angels.</p>
          <p>Slowly, but surely, the oneness of civilization, like the
oneness of humanity, is everywhere asserting itself and
gathering its momentum until all its holding points shall center
in a common unit of a civic, political, and inter-commercial
metropolis, from whose brightness the earth shall be
enlightened with “the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of
man.”</p>
          <p>The first great obstacle in the way of the unification of the
world's civilizations is the want of the unification of the human
race. As long as there are broad and deep
<pb id="hols275" n="275"/>
racial distinctions, produced by the various conditions
under which the different wings of the human kind have
existed, there will be those racial antipathies and
prejudices that have so long been the bane of society and the
curse of the nations. Everywhere the blighting and
withering blasts of caste and prejudice have left their
deep imprint upon the social, civic, moral and political
records of the peoples of the world. Race hatred is the
strongest, the most enduring of all hatred. It is a despicable
culmination of the hatred of all the individuals
of a race or people, collected and crowded into the heart
and life of many individuals of another race or people.
They despise each other, not because they are the lower
class of the same race, but they despise because they are
of a different and distinct race. In the instincts of man,
as in the instincts of the lower animals, there is, apparently
at least, an inherent or natural propensity for class
to seek its class. Hogs do not like the company of goats,
nor horses the company of cows. The rich and the educated
will not seek the association of poor and ignorant
because they are of different tastes, feelings and practices
in the social sphere. They live on different planes in the
same country, and there is a manifest incongruity and a
want of harmony in the social state that prevent that
close personal contact that exists between social equals.
If, then, there is such a difference among individuals of
the same race, merely because of their class, then there
will be a greater difference between individuals of two
or more distinct races; and as long as these real and supposed
differences exist between man and man, there will
be a conflict of forces and interests, so directed in their
exhaustive regime as to delay, if not despoil, the world
of the speedy redemption from the evils that have grown
up from the pestiferous soil of human prejudices. Be
it understood that we do not want to make the impression
that, because one man does not associate with another
on account of the difference of race or class, he necessarily
<pb id="hols276" n="276"/>
hates the other. This is not necessary, neither is it always
the case. On the contrary, there are thousands of people in all
classes and races who love all classes and races, and thousands
have given their lives to ameliorate and better the condition of
others. On the other hand, race hatred is perverse and criminal,
and proceeds from the depraved and “downright cussedness of
human nature.”</p>
          <p>Why should one man hate another because he is of a different
race? Who does it, or who can it help or benefit? It makes no
one better, but always makes the man who hates worse and more
depraved in his nature and proclivities. Hatred contains the
essential elements of murder, and the Scriptures of Holy Writ
substantiate this when they declare: “He that hateth his brother is
a murderer.” As human nature is one and inseparable as to its real
substantial qualities and tendencies, civilization is destined to
become so changed and revolutionized in its works and effects
that this race prejudice is to become a thing of the past; because it
is in the way of those aggregated interests and intellectual
propulsions that have given the world its present degree of
advancement in the social state. The world moves. It dips its
expanding horizon into out-lying seas and oceanic fathoms to
disgorge from the deep the hidden treasures and unpolished gems
that seem to sleep on the pebbly bottom. These when polished by
human culture shall bedeck the crown and bestud the heavens of a
triumphant and unified civilization. Nothing but physical disaster
and material dissolution can absorb the force, or subtract that
driving universal intellectual energy that now collects its agencies
and moulds the thought, the life, and the sentiment of ages into
one great intellectual, international, and inter-racial man. Then a
mighty force is driving the wheels of a new civilization in a new
age. Not new is it as to its ground principles and native
elements, but new in the facts discovered, the truths revealed, and the
<pb id="hols277" n="277"/>
exhibition of hidden life, by the touch of whose fingers the
rocks are turned to silver, silver into gold, gold into diamonds,
and diamonds into those lost jewels that fell from the crown of
angels in the conflicting transition from the old to the new. The
age itself is full of energy, drawing man upward and upward to
himself—his more and perfect self. The selfhood of self is
becoming more asserted. Man is rounding into that high and
ethereal realization that himself is one, that he is an entity with
an ineffacable identity, whose essential and divine personale
shall outlast the stars, and glow in its ineffable splendors amid
the ages of newer domains and brighter dispensations.</p>
          <p>So forcible and widespread, so deep and earnest are the
movements of the spiritual and intellectual energy to reach and
conquer the powers of nature, in behalf of her thinking
exponents, that wide seas lose their terrors, high mountains are
bored through, commerce harnesses the waves, and the lightning
flashes the accents of truth around the globe.</p>
          <p>The advancements and discoveries of science have brought all
nations near together, and so far as intercourse—commercial,
political, and religious—is concerned, they speak to each other
daily—almost face to face. The market's of London, New York,
Paris, Berlin, and Canton are so intermit, so near each other, and
each so full of all the rest, that whatever affects one affects all
the commercial centers of the great family of man. There are
now no more strangers and foreigners, but all are of the
household of the same civilization to an astonishing degree; and
this tendency must increase as the interests of the world
demand. Nothing will be allowed to stand in its way.</p>
          <p>Here racial prejudice must fall and bow to the better and
higher interests of man.</p>
          <p>Nothing seems more apparent than the tendency of all the
nations to become one in blood as well as in interest.
<pb id="hols278" n="278"/>
Shem, Ham, and Japhet are all nearly ill the same house and eating at
the same table, saying the same prayers, singing the same songs,
and worshipping the same God. These are the children of a common
mother and a common sireship with a common destiny.</p>
          <p>In the onward trend and rounding out of this great civilization,
white and black, red and swarthy, with all the seven colors of the
rainbow, shall be ground to dust and calcined by the stately tramp of

          <head>The Great Presence.</head>
          <p>That we are in the midst of some great, all-pervading and
extraordinary influence, is a most touching and signal fact. We
have reached that period in the step of centuries and the cycles,
and that degree of spiritual and mental development, where we
seem to touch the hem of the Great Master's garment. We seem
to sit at his feet, feel his throbbing heart, hear his thrilling
voice, while the halo of his countenance fills the whole human
hemisphere in the twilighted splendors of a majesty that comes
from beyond the stars of God. The Great Galilean is visiting the
islands, treading the waters and walking through the continents
of human consciousness as never before in the long history of
nations and ages. The very air that we breathe, and the sunbeams
that gild the horizon with golden light, bear him gently, though
strongly, to human consciousness, and the intelligence of
universal humanity. The winds are His chariot, the clouds His
throne, and the mists of the foaming deep His pavilion.</p>
          <p>Indeed, there is a universal presence of an increasing
and centralizing force that is stronger than nature, more
pungent and deep-throbbing than electricity or the subtle
activities of ethereal currents. Beneath the active force
and energies of human progress, there is an arm of power,
a thrilling somewhat that is silently at work sending its
awakening influence to all parts of the mental and conscious
humanity. We are in the presence of the great Christ—not
the Christ of modern or ancient days, but the
universal and eternal Christ of God, crowned from eternity
and sceptered before the sun blazed, stars twinkled,
or angels played on their harps. He is the God-sent, the
divine Legate, who is to propagate and diffuse His inspiring
spirituality until the august and adorable Son of
<pb id="hols280" n="280"/>
Man shall stand in the presence of all men, and pour Himself
into the entire drama of human life. Evidently, Christianity is
crystalizing its forces, concentrating its energies, so as to give
the greatest momentum to the evolutions of thought and actions.
We see, as we never saw before, the moral concept and the
spiritual comprehensions stricken off in clearer lines and more
radiant with distinctiveness of character than in former ages.
Faith is becoming more and more a tangible matter of fact, and
with its spanning arches is seen to rest upon the fundamentals of
the spiritual universe. Christ was a great philosopher as well as a
great prophet. His teachings, along with the demonstrations of
power displayed in the healing art, were based upon the laws or
governing principles of nature. He took hold of nature in its
deepest mental and physical phases, tied its broken cords and
cables, belted their disobedient elements about His arm of
power, coerced their rebellious fragments into line, commanded
the molecular universe, and its activities obeyed the voice of the
Son of God.</p>
          <p>All through the long ages of human darkness He has
been their rising Sun and the living Power from whose
central throne the peeping and glinting rays of resplendent
hope that have inspired their upliftings and aspirations
have sprung. His voice is the music that wooed and
thrilled the human spheres, vibrated the human mechanism
and taught respondent souls the ways of divine providence,
and cheered the millions with the truth of God
and the realization of the eternal future. He is drawing
nearer and nearer to all human hearts and human
consciousness. Onwards the overshadowing presence climbs
the ecliptic of the busy world, dislodging from its high
places the subtle children of hell and the black squadrons.
of sin and darkness. The great presence—what is it?
What is that mysterious force that seems to play on the
universal harp of universal humanity? What is this wondrous
power, this magic wand that sweeps the zones of
<pb id="hols281" n="281"/>
human devices and plays with almighty momentum on the social
and civil planes of organized society? What is this that is
changing the sentiment of men, expanding the mental vision and
enlarging the moral periphery in the sphere of thought,
philosophy and philanthropic activity? Is it mere science,
progress and discovery, or the mere product of human genius?
Or is the force of age upon age filing its victories upon
victories, and achievements upon achievements? Nay, these are
the fruits of the great presence—of the active Christ in personal
transition, the living embodiment of truth and the active Jehovic
Dispenser of the reforming and transforming kingdom of heaven.
“The whole earth is crammed with heaven, and every common
bush is afire with God,” in the great personality of His Son. Mark
the steps of modern civilization, read the signs of the times, and
measure the strength and weigh the momentum of the trembling
forces of evil. A mighty Prince with signal power and the
dynamic forces of the spiritual <hi rend="italics">arcana</hi> is standing at the end of
the dying century, and, like the rising sun on a calm sea, the soft
rays of His bright and resplendent light adumbrate His coming
and depict His majestic presence. The Song of Solomon says,
“The voice of my beloved! Behold he cometh, leaping upon the
mountains, skipping upon the hills.” Already we are immersed in
the fullness of His joy and the plenitude of His presence. But as
He advances upon the sphere of human thought and activity, both
good and evil are intensified. The wicked grow more wicked, and
the righteous more righteous. As the conflict approaches active
engagement, and as the two dissimilar powers line up in battle
array, the lines of demarcation are more fully drawn. The devil
will be more devilish, and the Christ more Christly. Reserved
powers, latent activities, and long pent-up magazines of force
will explode, and, the onslaught will be more dreadful and
fearful as the Great Presence permeates the moral mass, and
vibrates the centers of the human arena.</p>
          <pb id="hols282" n="282"/>
          <p>Who is it that has not felt the Great Presence? What
zone or parallel is there in the habitable earth that does
not feel His wondrous touch, the thrilling force of His divine
magnetism and the impressiveness of His unique
personality? The entire kingdom of men “is the Lord's.”
“His kingdom ruleth over all,” and he will come “whose
right it is.” Say what you please and do what you please,
“the kingdom is the Lord's.” “It is not by might, nor by
power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord.” Hence, it “is not
power” by which the process of redemption is carried
on. Not by armies and navies or the unsheathed sword,
or the skilled diplomacy and intrigue of wise statesmanship
is it carried on. No flourish of trumpets, no bugle
blasts, no rattling of drums, no high-sounding clarionets,
no metal ring of cymbals, no chariots of iron with prancing
steeds and amber wheels stained with human gore
and rolling in the blood of the slain, mark His coming.
Nay, verily, His coming is in silent power of the wonderful
God. His steps are softer than the fragrance of the
rosebud, and as gentle as the evening zephyrs laden with
the music of the spheres and the breath of flowers. “The
kingdom of God cometh not with observation,” but like
the noiseless flow of a river. He treads the veins of commerce,
walks the royal highways of the world's greatness
unobserved, and is found in the palaces of kings, the diamond
chambers of queens, the secret precincts of premiers,
and in the chair of national executives. Surely we
are in the midst of a Great presence. How wonderful is
this age! How forceful and resourceful is the Divine
Presence! Then, children of God, look up and look
around you. He is here in your midst, in the highways
of your cities, plains and rural districts. He stands at
your doors, turning the knob or pulling the latchstring.</p>

          <head>The Connection of Spirit and Body.</head>
          <p>It is evident that there is a spirit and that there is a body. The
oldest, the most real and most extensive is spirit. The difference
between the two is the difference of life and death, or that that is
self-active, and that that is not self-active. Spirit acts without
matter or body, or acts when there is nothing to act upon, by, or
through. Where there is action there must be spirit, since
nothing can act without its presence, either mediately or
immediately. If matter moves, takes form, or assumes condition,
change, or progression, its activity is dependent upon a deeper,
broader and more sensitive force, which embraces the elements
or properties of a perfect entirety, or an eternal reality. As the
human body is the mere instrument of the soul or spirit, so God,
the Spirit of spirits, is the hidden or indwelling Life of all life,
and the active forces of nature are but the instruments, as well
as the manifestations, of the divine presence and power, and are
the only means by which the intelligent universe can behold the
power and presence of the Infinite. There are first and second
causes, or rather there is a first and central cause, and all else are
but second causes, results or emanations of the only cause. All
second causes in the physical spheres and immensities are
nothing but the moving changes or precipitations of the
molecules of the whole or parts of the universal system; and as
precipitant elements move as they are moved upon by the
causative, they constitute molecular force. This molecular force
is the tangible activities of the world and the universe which we
call nature. In this sense nature, in its multiform and complex
mechanism, is as much the instrument of God as the human hand
or foot or tongue is the instrument of the human mind. Strictly
speaking, spirit is the
<pb id="hols284" n="284"/>
only perfect reality in the universe, because it is the only thing
that has attributes of perception and is utterly incapable of
annihilation. It is incapable of annihilation because it is not an
entity in the sense of limitation. That is, it has all the faculties
and properties of perfect self and perfect realization without
beginning, growth or accretions of parts or combination of
elements. Hence, spirit has neither body, nor parts, nor
tangibility. Or, in other words, if spirit has form, or any kind of
molecular constituency, its peculiar nature is so high, ethereal,
and attenuated in itself, that we, in common with all intelligent
creatures of the universal spheres, have no faculties by which we
can comprehend its nature. This rests upon perfect and true
philosophical grounds, since nothing call be greater than the
greatest, and before the intelligent personalities of the universe
call comprehend the Spirit of spirits, these personalities must
have existed prior to, and independent of, the Eternal. The
opposite conclusion is splendidly absurd and presents a solecism
that distresses thought and tortures the imaginary faculties.</p>
          <p>In their real nature there is no difference between those
atoms or molecules that compose the human body and those
that compose the bodies of the inferior animals, or even those
that enter or compose the vegetable or mineral kingdoms, and
the bodies of men are as much of earth and air as the hills, mines
or other material forms and elements that compose the universe.</p>
          <p>Hence form has nothing to do with the inherent properties of
matter any more than it has to do with the nature of spirit or
mental individuality. Change of state, condition or relation,
cannot affect the nature, or the inherent qualities of spirit.
Punishment may bring repentance and obedience to the laws of
God and the requirements of righteousness in this or in some
other state of conscious existence, or disobedience may bring on
sin and inject the virus of wickedness into the spiritual or
mental reality; but none of them can produce deterioration,
<pb id="hols285" n="285"/>
or change, the real mental conscious individual. If it
were otherwise, there could be no such thing as eternal or
indefinite punishment. Even human laws presuppose the
continuous personal conscious identity of the mental character,
since men are often punished upon the supposition that they
will remain the same person, or the same mental character to
the end of natural life that they were when first adjudged guilty
and assigned to life commitment.</p>
          <p>There must be something in the character or nature
by which every spirit or mental individual will be
known of distinguished from every other such character in the
universe. The very nature of government, whether it be of God
or man, presupposes that every single individual is separate and
distinct from every other one in the great whole, and it is a
special and particular attribute of justice in the administration of
government to avoid the infliction of punishment upon the
innocent, and withhold rewards from the unworthy. The greatest
scrutiny and care are exercised in the distribution of rewards and
punishment lest the wrong person should be dealt with. In
their fundamentals, there is no difference in the government
of God and the government of men. Both are based upon
righteousness, equity and justice. Mercy is not an attribute of
government any more than it is an attribute of
God. There may be a government without mercy, but there
can be no government in the strict sense of the term without
justice, equity and righteousness. This is government and all else
is anarchy. No transgressor can claim mercy as of right or justice.
It does not belong to him as a part of his inherited right,
but justice belongs to him because he is a citizen of the
universe and under the protection of its government and laws.
Again, every intelligent being has an inherent claim on justice,
because he is a conscious intelligence, and because he is in
no way responsible for his being or his creation, or those eternal
mental
<pb id="hols286" n="286"/>
endowments or faculties of which he is possessed and
which he cannot destroy or reduce to nonentity. No attribute
of intelligent natures can disappear or be annihilated
by any power less than itself, and therefore it is incapable
of decay or inaction. Presuming that the above
is predicated upon sound metaphysical reasoning, we
reach the sequence that man, in common with all other
intelligent existences, is an eternal conscious fixture in
the universal circle of being. He is an eternal citizen
with an indestructible identity, forever dwelling on a
plane where annihilation can never come. This plane is in
his being, or his being is in or on this plane. Here dwell
in ethereal marvels and empyrean splendors all the expansive
personal majesties and towering intellects in
their universal home, forever aspiring in the highest,
broadest and profoundest spheres of the countless and
infinite activities. But as matter is incapable of punishment
and rewards, and as it has no principles or faculties
as a basis for responsibility, it is agreeable to truth and
philosophy when we say that nothing is and nothing can
be punished, or can receive rewards, but the mental or
spirit man, and those capable spiritualities that belong
to the intellectual sphere. Every spiritual reality must
be a capacity, that is, it must have capability to that degree
of volition that involves personal responsibility, and
consequently this responsibility is upon the moral plane.
This not only makes them subjects of rewards and punishment,
but involves that high degree of individualism by
which one mental character is distinguished from every
other. Since this is the case, there must be some outline
or characteristic inherent in all intelligent beings by,
which they are to be known. It may not consist in vital
or constitutional properties, but it may consist in some
exterior delineations through which the piercing art of
intuition may comprehend those differentia that must exist
among the individuals of the populous universe. We
could not perceive the identification of things or persons
<pb id="hols287" n="287"/>
if every one were exactly alike; neither could we distinguish
one place from another if all places were precisely
alike in all that make up each of all the places. Intuition
itself presupposes a differentiation among a multitude of
individuals—those necessary distinguishing features by
which one person may be known from every other person
or mental individual. Indeed, personal identity seems to
be an essential part or element of intellectual natures, as
without it one person cannot be known from other conscious
intellectualities. When an individual is disrobed
of his earthly habiliments and wrapt in the habit of the
spiritual, there can be no essential change in character
because of the transition. He is still himself in all the
plenitude and fundamentals of his being. He does not
become an impersonal reality or a mere thing because of
the change. In this world, expressions that consist in
many things form those features or idiosyncracies of
character and person by which one person is known from
all the rest, and who knows but that spirits, men, angels
and devils, and all the intellectualities of the universe,
are clothed in ethereal integuments, though imperceptible
to human vision and contact, yet suited to their nature,
plane and occupation? Yea, “He maketh his angels
winds and his ministers flames of fire.” Then we reach
the conclusion, upon philosophical deductions, that we
carry with us into the mysterious realities beyond not
only all the personal consciousness of tangible and intangible
being, but we carry with us the shape, form and
expressions that were given us in the creation, and which
we had from the beginning of our being. The human
form is divine, not in its inherent or native qualities, but
in its chartered shape, expression, features and outlines.
The contour of the personality is divinely appointed and
stereotyped as an essential part or element of being. It
cannot be thrown off, covered or disguised, and wherever
the individual moves, speaks or acts in the sphere of
being, he will be known as that special and specific
<pb id="hols288" n="288"/>
personality. As every living actuality is a self-acting entity
under law and responsibility, his history is registered in
space and all the personal data are reflected and wafted
in and through the radiating spheres and immensities.
The acts and facts of his being cannot be obliterated, lost
or forgotten, neither can they be extracted from the
enfolding records of the progressive spheres. Man is a book,
a history within himself. On and in the mental inlays of
growth and development he engraves himself upon himself,
and unconsciously he writes his own history, records
his own acts and thoughts, and his life keeps its own
register. As he is self-acting, he is self-registering, and
the universe, with its faithful records, is a duplicating
mirror in which every man and mental activity can find
himself faithfully portrayed in the eternal archives of
the eternal spheres.</p>
