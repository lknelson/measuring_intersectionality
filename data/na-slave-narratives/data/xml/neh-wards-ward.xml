        <opener>
<salute>MADAM:</salute></opener>
        <p>The frank and generous sympathy evinced by
your Grace in behalf of American slaves has been
recognized by all classes, and is gratefully cherished by the
Negro's heart.</p>
        <p>A kind Providence placed me for a season within the
circle of your influence, and made me largely share its
beneficent action, in the occasional intercourse of Nobles
and Ladies of high rank, who sympathize in your
sentiments. I am devoutly thankful to God, the Creator of
the Negro, for this gleam of his sunshine, though it should
prove but a brief token of his favour; and desire that my
oppressed kindred may yet show themselves not unworthy
of their cause being advocated by the noblest of all lands,
and sustained and promoted by the wise and virtuous of
every region.</p>
        <p>I cannot address your Grace as an equal; though the
generous nobility of your heart would require that I should
use no expression inconsistent with the dignity of a man,
the creation of God's infinite wisdom and goodness. I
cannot give flattering titles, or employ the language of
adulation:
<pb id="wardiv" n="iv"/>
I should offend your Grace if I did so, and prove myself
unworthy of that good opinion which I earnestly covet.</p>
        <p>To you, Madam, I am indebted for many instances of
spontaneous kindness, and to your influence I owe frequent
opportunities of representing the claims of my oppressed
race. I should not have felt emboldened to attempt the
authorship of this Volume, had it not been for a conviction,
sustained by unmistakable tokens, that in all classes, from
the prince to the peasant, there is a chord of sympathy
which vibrates to the appeals of my suffering people.</p>
        <p>Before your Grace can see these lines, I shall be again
traversing the great Atlantic. Will you, Madam, pardon this
utterance of the deep-felt sentiment of a grateful heart,
which can only find indulgence and relief in the humble
dedication of this Volume to you, as my honoured
patroness, and the generous friend of the Negro people in
all lands?</p>
        <p>I am not versed in the language of courts or the etiquette
of the peerage; but my heart is warm with gratitude, and my
pen can but faintly express the sense of obligations I shall
long cherish toward your noble House and the illustrious
members of your Grace's family, from whom I have
received many undeserved kindnesses.</p>
        <closer><salute>I have the honour to be, Madam,
<lb/>
Your Grace's most obedient and grateful Servant,</salute>

        <head>PREFACE.</head>
        <p>THE idea of writing some account of my travels was first
suggested to me by a gentleman who has
not a little to do with the bringing out of this work. The
Rev. Dr. Campbell also encouraged the suggestion. I then
thought that a series of letters in a newspaper would answer
the purpose. Circumstances over which I had no control
placed it beyond my power to accomplish the design in that
form of publication.</p>
        <p>A few months ago I was requested to spend an evening
with some ardent friends of the Negro race,
by the arrangement of Mrs. Massie, at her house, Upper
Clapton. Her zeal and constancy in behalf of
the American Slave are well known on both sides of the
Atlantic. Nor is there, I believe, a more earnest friend of my
kindred race than is her husband. With him I have
repeatedly taken counsel on the best modes of serving our
cause. Late in August last, Dr. Massie urged on me the
propriety of preparing a volume which might remain as 
a parting memorial of my visit to England, and serve to 
embody and perpetuate the opinions and arguments I had 
often employed to promote
<pb id="wardvi" n="vi"/>
the work of emancipation. Peter Carstairs, Esq., of
Madras, being present, cordially and frankly encouraged the
project; and other friends, in whose judgment I had confidence, 
expressed their warmest approval. My publisher has generously 
given every facility for rendering the proposal practicable. To 
him I owe my warmest obligations for the promptitude and elegance 
with which the Volume has been prepared.</p>
        <p>I do not think the gentlemen who advised it were quite
correct in anticipating that so much would be acceptable, in
a Book from me. I should have gone about it with much
better courage if I had not felt some fears on this point.
However, amidst many apprehensions of imperfection, I
place it before the reader, begging him to allow me a word
by way of apology. I was obliged to write in the midst of
most perplexing, most embarrassing, private business, and
had not a solitary book or paper to refer to, for a fact or
passage; my brain alone had to supply all I wished to
compose or compile. Time, too, was very limited. Under
these circumstances, that I should have committed some
slight inaccuracies, will not appear very strange, though I
trust they are not very great or material. I beg the reader
generously to forgive the faults he detects, and to believe
that my chief motive in writing is the promotion of that
cause in whose service I live. I hope that this Book will not
be looked upon as a specimen of what a well educated
Negro could do, nor as a fair representation
<pb id="wardvii" n="vii"/>
of what Negro talent can produce—knowing that, with
better materials, more time, and in more favourable 
circumstances, even <hi rend="italics">I </hi>could have done much
better; and knowing also, that my superiors among my own
people would have written far more acceptably.</p>
        <p>It will be seen that I have freely made remarks upon other
things than slavery, and compared my own with those of
other peoples. I did the former as a Man, the latter as a
Negro. As a Negro, I live and therefore write for my people;
as a Man, I freely speak my mind upon whatever concerns
me and my fellow men. If any one be disappointed or
offended at that, I shall regret it; all the more, as it is
impossible for me to say that, in like circumstances, I should
not do<hi rend="italics"> just the same </hi>again.</p>
        <p>The reader will not find the dry details of a journal, nor
any of my speeches or sermons. I preferred to weave into
the Work the themes upon which I have spoken, rather than
the speeches themselves. The Work is not a literary one, for
it is not written by a literary man; it is no more than its
humble title indicates—the Autobiography of a Fugitive
Negro. In what sense I am a fugitive, will appear on perusal
of my personal and family history.</p>

          <head>FAMILY HISTORY.</head>
          <p>I WAS born on the 17th October,  1817, in that part of
the State of Maryland, U. S., commonly called the
Eastern Shore. I regret that I can give no accurate
account of the precise location of my birthplace. I may
as well state now the reason of my ignorance of this
matter. My parents were slaves. I was born a slave.
They escaped, and took their then only child with
them. I was not then old enough to know anything
about my native place; and as I grew up, in the State of
New Jersey, where my parents lived till I was nine
years old, and in the State of New York subsequently,
where we lived for many years, my parents were 
always in danger of being arrested and re-enslaved. To
avoid this, they took every possible caution: among
their measures of caution was the keeping of the
children quite ignorant of their birthplace, and of their
condition, whether free or slave, when born; because
children might, by the dropping of a single 
<pb id="ward4" n="4"/>
word, lead to the betrayal of their parents. My brother,
however, was born in New Jersey; and my parents,
supposing (as is the general presumption) that to be
born in a free State is to be born free, readily allowed
us to tell where my brother was born; but <hi rend="italics">my</hi>
birthplace I was neither permitted to tell nor to know.
Hence, while the <sic corr="secrecy">secresy</sic> and mystery thrown about
the matter led me, most naturally, to suspect that I was
born a slave, I never received direct evidence of it,
from either of my parents, until I was four-and-twenty
years of age; and then my mother informed my wife, in
my absence. Generous reader, will you therefore
kindly forgive my inability to say exactly where I was
born; what gentle stream arose near the humble
cottage where I first breathed—how that stream
sparkled in the sunlight, as it meandered through
green meadows and forests of stately oaks, till it gave
its increased self as a contribution to the Chesapeake
Bay—if I do not tell you the name of my native town
and county, and some interesting details of their
geographical, agricultural, geological, and
revolutionary history—if I am silent as to just how
many miles I was born from Baltimore the metropolis,
or Annapolis the capital, of my native State? Fain
would I satisfy you in all this; but I cannot, from sheer
ignorance. I was born a slave—where? Wherever it
was, it was
<pb id="ward5" n="5"/>
where I dare not be seen or known, lest those who
held my parents and ancestors in slavery should
make a claim, hereditary or legal, in some form, to the
ownership of my body and soul.</p>
          <p>My father, from what I can gather, was descended
from an African prince. I ask no particular attention to
this, as it comes to me simply from tradition—such
tradition as poor slaves may maintain. Like the sources
of the Nile, my ancestry, I am free to admit, is rather
difficult of tracing. My father was a pure-blooded 
negro, perfectly black, with woolly hair; but, as is 
frequently true of the purest negroes, of small, handsome 
features. He was about 5 feet 10 inches in height, of good figure,
cheerful disposition, bland manners, slow in deciding,
firm when once decided, generous and unselfish to a
fault; and one of the most consistent, simple-hearted,
straightforward Christians, I ever knew. What I have grouped 
together here concerning him you would see in your first 
acquaintance with him, and you would see the same
throughout his entire life. Had he been educated, free,
and admitted to the social privileges in early life for
which nature fitted him, and for which even slavery
could not, did not, altogether <hi rend="italics">unfit</hi> him, my
poor crushed, outraged people would never have had
nor needed a better representation of themselves—a
better specimen of the black gentleman.
<pb id="ward6" n="6"/>
Yes: among the heaviest of my maledictions against
slavery is that which it deserves for keeping my poor
father—and millions like him—in the midnight and
dungeon of the grossest ignorance. Cowardly system
as it is, it does not dare to allow the slave access to
the commonest sources of light and learning.</p>
          <p>After his escape, my father learned to read, so that
he could enjoy the priceless privilege of searching the
Scriptures. Supporting himself by his trade as a house
painter, or whatever else offered (as he was a man of
untiring industry), he lived in Cumberland County,
New Jersey, from 1820 until 1826; in New York city
from that year until 1838; and in the city of Newark,
New Jersey, from 1838 until May 1851, when he died,
at the age of 68.</p>
          <p>In April I was summoned to his bedside, where I
found him the victim of paralysis. After spending
some few days with him, and leaving him very much
better, I went to Pennsylvania on business, and
returned in about ten days, when he appeared still
very comfortable; I then, for a few days, left him. My
mother and I knew that another attack was to be
feared—another, we knew too well, would prove fatal;
but when it would occur was of course beyond our
knowledge; but we hoped for the best. My father and
I talked very freely of his death. He had always
maintained that a Christian ought
<pb id="ward7" n="7"/>
to have his preparation for his departure made, and
completed in Christ, before death, so as when death
should come he should have nothing to do BUT TO
DIE. “That,” said my father, “is enough to do at once:
let repenting, believing, everything else, be sought at a
proper time; let dying alone be done at the dying time.”
In my last conversation with him he not only
maintained, but he <hi rend="italics">felt</hi>, the same. Then, he seemed as
if he might live a twelvemonth; but eight-and-forty
hours from that time, as I sat in the Rev. A. G.
Beeman's pulpit, in New Haven, after the opening
services, while singing the hymn which immediately
preceded the sermon, a telegraphic despatch was
handed me, announcing my father's death. I begged
Mr. Beeman to preach; his own feelings were such, 
that he could not, and I was obliged to make the effort. 
No effort ever cost me so much. Have I trespassed 
upon your time too much by these details? Forgive the 
fondness of the filial, the bereaved, the fatherless.</p>
          <p>My mother was a widow at the time of her marriage
with my father, and was ten years his senior. I know
little or nothing of her early life: I think she was not a
mother by her first marriage. To my father she bore
three children, all boys, of whom I am the second.
Tradition is my only authority for my maternal
ancestry: that authority saith, that on the paternal side
my mother
<pb id="ward8" n="8"/>
descended from Africa. Her mother, however, was a
woman of light complexion; her grandmother, a
mulattress; her great-grandmother, the daughter of an
Irishman, named Martin, one of the largest
slaveholders in Maryland—a man whose slaves were so
numerous, that he did not know the number of them.
My mother was of dark complexion, but straight silklike
hair; she was a person of large frame, as tall as my
father, of quick discernment, ready decision, great
firmness, strong will, ardent temperament, and of
deep, devoted, religious character. Though a woman,
she was not of so pleasing a countenance as my father,
and I am thought strongly to resemble her. Like my
father, she was converted in early life, and was a
member of the Methodist denomination (though a
lover of all Christian denominations) until her death.
This event, one of the most afflictive of my life,
occurred on the first day of September, 1853, at New
York. Since my father's demise I had not seen her for
nearly a year; when, being about to sail for England, at
the risk of being apprehended by the United States'
authorities for a breach of their execrable republican
Fugitive Slave Law, I sought my mother, found her,
and told her I was about to sail at three p.m., that day
(April 20th, 1853), for England. With a calmness and
composure which she could always command when
emergencies
<pb id="ward9" n="9"/>
required it, she simply said, in a quiet tone, “To
England, my son!” embraced me, commended me to
God, and suffered me to depart without a murmur. It
was our last meeting. May it be our last parting! For
the kind sympathy shown me, upon my reception of
the melancholy news of my mother's decease, by many
English friends, I shall ever be grateful: the recollection
of that event, and the kindness of which it was the
occasion, will dwell together in my heart while reason
and memory shall endure.</p>
          <p>In the midst of that peculiarly bereaved feeling
inseparable from realizing the thought that one is both
fatherless and motherless, it was a sort of melancholy
satisfaction to know that my dear parents were gone
beyond the reach of slavery and the Fugitive Law.
Endangered as their liberty always was, in the <hi rend="italics">free</hi>
Northern States of New York and New Jersey—doubly
so after the law of 1851—I could but feel a great deal of
anxiety concerning them. I knew that there was no
living claimant of my parents' bodies and souls; I
knew, too, that neither of them would tamely submit to
re-enslavement: but I also knew that it was quite
possible there should be creditors, or heirs at law; and
that there is no State in the American Union wherein
there were not free and independent democratic
republicans, and <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fre">soi-disant</foreign></hi> Christians,
<pb id="ward10" n="10"/>
“ready, aye ready ” to aid in overpowering and
capturing a runaway, <hi rend="italics">for pay.</hi> But when God was
pleased to take my father in 1851, and my mother
in 1853, I felt relief from my greatest earthly
anxiety. Slavery had denied them education,
property, caste, rights, liberty; but it could not
deny them the application of Christ's blood, nor an
admittance to the rest prepared for the righteous.
They could not be buried in the same part of a
common graveyard, with whites, in their native
country; but they can rise at the sound of the first
trump, in the day of resurrection. Yes, reader:
we who are slaveborn derive a comfort and solace
from the death of those dearest to us, if they have
the sad misfortune to be BLACKS and AMERICANS,
that you know not. God forbid that you or yours
should ever have occasion to know it!</p>
          <p>My eldest brother died before my birth: my
youngest brother, Isaiah Harper Ward, was born
April 5th, 1822, in Cumberland County, New Jersey;
and died at New York, April 16th, 1838, in the triumphs
of faith. He was a lad partaking largely of my father's
qualities, resembling him exceedingly. Being the
youngest of the family, we all sought to fit him for
usefulness, and to shield him from the thousand
snares and the ten thousand forms of cruelty and
injustice which the unspeakably cruel prejudice of the
whites visits upon the
<pb id="ward11" n="11"/>
head and the heart of every black young man, in New
York. To that end, we secured to him the advantages of
the Free School, for coloured youths, in that city—
advantages which, I am happy to say, were neither lost
upon him nor unappreciated by him. Upon leaving
school he commenced learning the trade of a printer,
in the office of Mr. Henry R. Piercy, of New York—a
gentleman who, braving the prejudices of  his craft
and of the community, took the lad upon the same
terms as those upon which he took white lads: a fact
all the more creditable to Mr. Piercy, as it was in the
very teeth of the abominably debased public sentiment
of that city (and of the whole country, in fact) on this
subject. But ere Isaiah had finished his trade, he
suddenly took a severe cold, which resulted in
pneumonia, and—in death.</p>
          <p>I expressed a doubt, in a preceding page, as to the
legal validity of my brother's freedom. True, he was
born in the nominally Free State of New Jersey; true,
the inhabitants born in Free States are <hi rend="italics">generally</hi> free.
But according to slave law, “the child follows the
condition of the mother, during life.” My mother being
born of a slave woman, and not being legally freed,
those who had a legal claim to her had also a legal
claim to her offspring, wherever born, of whatever
paternity. Besides, at that time New Jersey had not
entirely ceased to be
<pb id="ward12" n="12"/>
a Slave State. Had my mother been legally freed before
his birth, then my brother would have been born free,
because born of a free woman. As it was, we were all
liable at any time to be captured, enslaved, and 
re-enslaved—first, because we had been robbed of our
liberty; then, because our ancestors had been robbed
in like manner; and, thirdly and conclusively, in law,
because we were black Americans.</p>
          <p>I confess I never felt any personal fear of being
retaken—primarily because, as I said before, I knew of
no legal claimants; but chiefly because I knew it
would be extremely difficult to identify me. I was less
than three years old when brought away: to identify
me as a man would be no easy matter. Certainly,
slaveholders and their more wicked Northern parasites
are not very particularly scrupulous about such
matters; but still, I never had much fear. My private
opinion is, that he who would have enslaved me
would have “caught a Tartar”: for my peace
principles never extended so far as to <hi rend="italics">either seek or
accept peace at the expense of liberty</hi>—if,
indeed, a state of slavery can by any possibility be a
state of peace.</p>
          <p>I beg to conclude this chapter on my family
history by adding, that my father had a cousin, in
New Jersey, who had escaped from slavery. In the
spring of 1826 he was cutting down a tree, which
accidentally fell upon him, breaking both
<pb id="ward13" n="13"/>
thighs. While suffering from this accident his master
came and took him back into Maryland. He continued
<hi rend="italics">lame</hi> a very great while, without any <hi rend="italics">apparent</hi> signs
of amendment, until one fine morning he was gone!
They never took him again.</p>
          <p>Two of my father's nephews, who had escaped to
New York, were taken back in the most summary
manner, in 1828. I never saw a family thrown into such
deep distress by the death of any two of its members,
as were our family by the re-enslavement of these two
young men. Seven-and-twenty years have past, but
we have none of us heard a word concerning them,
since their consignment to the living death, the
temporal hell, of American slavery.</p>
          <p>Some kind persons who may read these pages will
accuse me of bitterness towards Americans generally,
and slaveholders particularly: indeed, there are many
<hi rend="italics">professed</hi> abolitionists, on both sides of the Atlantic,
who have no idea that a black man should feel
towards and speak of his tormenters as a white man
would concerning his. But suppose the blacks had
treated <hi rend="italics">your</hi> family in the manner the Americans have
treated <hi rend="italics">mine,</hi> for five generations: how would you
write about these blacks, and their system of
bondage? You would agree with me, that the 109th
Psalm, from the 5th to the 21st verses inclusive, was
written almost purposely for them.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
          <head>PERSONAL HISTORY.</head>
          <p>I HAVE narrated when and where I was born, as
far as I know. It seems that when young I was a
very weakly child, whose life for the first two years
and a half appeared suspended upon the most fragile
fibre of the most delicate cord. It is not probable
that any organic or constitutional disease was
afflicting me, but a general debility, the more
remarkable as both my parents were robust, healthy 
persons. Happily for me, my mother was permitted to
“hire her time,” as it is called in the South—<hi rend="italics">i.e.,</hi>
she was permitted to do what she pleased, and go
where she pleased, provided she paid to the estate
a certain sum annually. This she found ample
means of doing, by her energy, ingenuity, and 
economy. My mother was a good financier (O that
her mantle had fallen on me!) She paid the yearly 
hire, and pocketed a <hi rend="italics">surplus,</hi> wherewith she did
much to add to the comforts of her husband and her
sickly child. So long and so hopeless was my illness,
that the parties owning us feared I could not
<pb id="ward15" n="15"/>
be reared for the market—the only use for which,
according to their enlightened ideas, a young negro
could possibly be born or reared; their only hope was
in my mother's tenderness. Yes: the tenderness of a
mother, in that <hi rend="italics">intensely</hi> FREE Country, is a matter of
trade, and my poor mother's tender regard for her
offspring had its value in dollars and cents.</p>
          <p>When I was about two years old (so my mother
told my wife), my father, for some trifling mistake or
fault, was stabbed in the fleshy part of his arm, with a
penknife: the wound was the entire length of the
knife blade. On another occasion he received
a severe flogging, which left his back in so wretched
a state that my mother was obliged to take peculiar
precaution against mortification. This sort of
treatment of her husband not being relished by my
mother, who felt about the maltreatment of her
husband as any Christian woman ought to feel, she
put forth her sentiments, in pretty strong language.
This was insolent. Insolence in a negress could not
be endured—it would breed more and greater mischief
of a like kind; then what would become of wholesome
discipline? Besides, if so trifling a thing as the <hi rend="italics">mere
marriage relation</hi> were to interfere with the supreme
proprietor's right of a master over his slave, next we
should hear that slavery must give way before
marriage! Moreover, if a negress may be allowed free
speech, touching the flogging of a
<pb id="ward16" n="16"/>
negro, simply because that negro happened to be
her husband, how long would it be before some such
claim would be urged in behalf of some other
member of a negro family, in unpleasant 
circumstances? Would this be endurable,
in a republican civilised community, A. D. 1819?
By no means. It would sap the very foundation of 
slavery—it would be like “the letting out of water”: for
let the principle be once established that the negress
Anne Ward may speak as she pleases about the
flagellation of her husband, the negro William
Ward, as a matter of right, and like some alarming
and death-dealing infection it would spread from
plantation to plantation, until property in husbands
and wives would not be worth the having. No, no:
marriage must succumb to slavery, slavery must
reign supreme over every right and every institution,
however venerable or sacred; <hi rend="italics">ergo,</hi> this free-speaking Anne Ward must be made to fell the greater 
rigours of the domestic institution. Should she be 
flogged? that was questionable. She never
had been whipped, except, perhaps, by her parents;
she was now three-and-thirty years old—rather late
for the commencement of training; she weighed
184 lbs. avoirdupoise; she was strong enough to
whip an ordinary-sized man; she had as much
strength of <hi rend="italics">will</hi> as of mind; and what did not
diminish the awkwardness of the case was, she
<pb id="ward17" n="17"/>
gave most unmistakeable evidences of “rather tall
resistance,” in case of an attack. Well, then, it were wise
not to risk this; but one most convenient course was
left to them, and that course they could take with
perfect safety to themselves, without yielding one
hair's breadth of the rights and powers of slavery, but
establishing them—they could sell her, and sell her they
would: she was their property, and like any other stock
she <hi rend="italics">could</hi> be sold, and like any other unruly stock she
<hi rend="italics">should</hi> be brought to the market.</p>
          <p>However, this sickly boy, if practicable, must be
raised for the auction mart. Now, to sell his mother
<hi rend="italics">immediately,</hi> depriving him of her tender care, might
endanger his life, and, what was all-important in his life, 
his saleability. Were it not better to risk a little from the 
freedom of this woman's tongue, than to jeopardize the 
sale of this <hi rend="italics">article?</hi> Who knows but, judging from the 
pedigree, it may prove to be a prime lot—rising six feet in 
length, and weighing two hundred and twenty pounds, more 
or less, some day? To ask these questions was to answer
them; there was no resisting the force of such valuable
and logical considerations. Therefore the sale was
delayed; the young animal was to run awhile longer
with his—(I accommodate myself to the ideas and facts
of slavery, and use a corresponding nomenclature) 
<pb id="ward18" n="18"/>
—dam. Thus my illness prevented the separation of my
father and my mother from each other, and from their
only child. How God sometimes makes the afflictions
of His poor, and the very wickedness of their
oppressors, the means of blessing them! But how
slender the thread that bound my poor parents
together! the convalescence of their child, or his
death, would in all seeming probability snap it 
asunder. What depths of anxiety must my mother have
endured! How must the reality of his condition have
weighed down the fond heart of my father, concerning
their child! Could they pray for his continued illness?
No; they were parents. Could they petition God for his
health? Then they must soon be parted for ever from
each other and from him, were that prayer answered.
Ye whose children are born free, because you were so
born, know but little of what this enslaved pair
endured, for weeks and months, at the time to which I
allude.</p>
          <p>At length a crisis began to appear: the boy grew
better. God's blessing upon a mother's tender nursing
prevailed over habitual weakness and sickness. The
child slept better; he had less fever; his appetite
returned; he began to walk without tottering, and
seemed to give signs of the cheerfulness he inherited
from his father, and the strength of frame (and, to tell
truth, of will also)
<pb id="ward19" n="19"/>
imparted by his mother. Were not the owners
right in their “calculations”? Had they not
decided and acted wisely, in a business point of
view? The dismal prospect before them, connected 
with the returning health of their child,
damped the joy which my parents, in other 
circumstances, and in a more desirable country,
would have felt in seeing their child's improved
state. But the more certain these poor slaves
became that their child would soon be well, the
nearer approached the time of my mother's sale.
Motherlike, she pondered all manner of schemes
and plans to postpone that dreaded day. She
could close her child's eyes in death, she could
follow her husband to the grave, if God should so
order; but to be sold from them to the far-off State
of Georgia, the State to which Maryland members
of Churches sold their nominal fellow Christians—
sometimes their own children, and other poor 
relations—<hi rend="italics">that</hi> was more than she could bear. 
Submission to the will of God was one thing, she was
prepared for that, but submission to the machinations 
of Satan was quite another thing; neither her
womanhood nor her theology could be reconciled
to the latter. Sometimes pacing the floor half the
night with her child in her arms—sometimes kneeling 
for hours in secret prayer to God for deliverance
—sometimes in long earnest consultation with my
<pb id="ward20" n="20"/>
father as to what must be done in this dreaded
emergency—my mother passed days, nights, and weeks
of anguish which wellnigh drove her to desperation.
But a thought flashed upon her mind: she indulged in
it. It was full of danger; it demanded high resolution,
great courage, unfailing energy, strong determination;
it might fail. But it was only a thought, at most only an
indulged thought, perhaps the fruit of her very excited
state, and it was not yet a plan; but, for the life of her,
she could not shake it off. She kept saying to herself, 
“supposing I should”—Should what? She scarcely dare
say to herself, what. But that thought became familiar,
and welcome, and more welcome; it began to take
another, a more definite form. Yes; almost ere she knew,
it had incorporated itself with her will, and become a
resolution, a determination. “William,” said she to my
father, “we must take this child and run away.” She
said it with energy; my father felt it. He hesitated; he
was not a mother. She was decided; and when decided,
<hi rend="italics">she was decided</hi> with all consequences, conditions,
and contingencies accepted. As is the case in other
families where the wife leads, my father followed my
mother in her decision, and accompanied her in—I
almost said, her <hi rend="italics">hegira.</hi></p>

          <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
          <head>THE FUGITIVES FROM SLAVERY.</head>
          <p>WHAT was the precise sensation produced by the
departure of my parents, in the minds of their 
owners—how they bore it, how submissively they
spoke of it, how thoughtfully they followed us with
their best wishes, and so forth, I have no means of
knowing: information on these questionable topics
was never conveyed to us in any definite, systematic
form. Be this as it may, on a certain evening,
without previous notice, my mother took her child
in her arms, and stealthily, with palpitating heart,
but unfaltering step and undaunted courage, passed
the door, the outer gate, the adjoining court, crossed
the field, and soon after, followed by my father, left
the place of their former abode, bidding it adieu for
ever. I know not their route; but in those days
the track of the fugitive was neither so accurately
scented nor so hotly pursued by human sagacity, or
the scent of kindred bloodhounds, as now, nor was
slave-catching so complete and regular a system as
it is now. Occasionally a slave escaped, but seldom
<pb id="ward22" n="22"/>
in such numbers as to make it needful either to watch
them very closely when at home, or to trace them
systematically when gone. Indeed, our slave-catching
professionals may thank the slaves for the means by
which they earn their dishonourable subsistence; for if
the latter had never reduced running away to system,
the former had never been needed, and therefore
never employed at their present wretched occupation,
as a system. “ 'Tis an ill wind that blows nobody
good.”</p>
          <p>At the time of my parents' escape it was not always
necessary to go to Canada; they therefore did as the
few who then escaped mostly did—aim for a Free State,
and settle among Quakers. This honoured sect, unlike
any other in the world, in this respect, was regarded as
the slave's friend. This peculiarity of their religion they
not only <hi rend="italics">held,</hi> but so <hi rend="italics">practised</hi> that it impressed itself on
the ready mind of the poor victim of American tyranny.
To reach a Free State, and to live among Quakers, were
among the highest ideas of these fugitives; accordingly, 
obtaining the best directions they could,
they set out for Cumberland County, in the State of
New Jersey, where they had learned slavery did not
exist—Quakers lived in numbers, who would afford the
escaped any and every protection consistent with their
peculiar tenets—and where a number of blacks lived,
who in cases of emergency
<pb id="ward23" n="23"/>
could and would make common cause with and for
each other. Then these attractions of Cumberland
were sufficient to determine their course.</p>
          <p>I do not think the journey could have been a very
long one: but it must be travelled on foot, in some peril,
and with small, scanty means, next to nothing; and with
the burden (though they felt it not) of a child, nearly
three years old, both too young and too weakly to
perform his own part of the journey. One child they had
laid in the grave; now their only one must be rescued
from a fate worse than ten thousand deaths. Upon this
rescue depended their continued enjoyment of each
other's society. The many past evils inseparable from a
life of slavery, their recently threatened separation, and
the dangers of this <hi rend="italics">exodus,</hi> served to heighten that
enjoyment, and doubly to endear each to the other; and
the thought that they might at length be successful, and
as free husband and wife bring up their child in the
nurture and admonition of the Lord, according to the
best of their ability, stimulated them to fresh courage
and renewed endurance. Step by step, day after day,
and night after night, with their infant charge passed
alternately from the arms of the one to those of the
other; they wended on their way, driven by slavery,
drawn and stimulated by the hope of freedom, and all
the while trusting in and committing themselves to Him
who
<pb id="ward24" n="24"/>
is God of the oppressed. I can just remember one or
two incidents of the journey; they now stand before
me, associated with my earliest recollections of
maternal tenderness and paternal care: and it seems to
me, now that they are both gathered with the dead,
that I would rather forget any facts of  my childhood
than those connected with that, to me, in more
respects than one, all-important journey.</p>
          <p>Struggling against many obstacles, and by God's
help surmounting them, they made good progress until
they had got a little more than midway their journey,
when they were overtaken and ordered back by a
young man on horseback, who, it seems, lived in the
neighbourhood of my father's master. The youth had a
whip, and some other insignia of slaveholding
authority; and knowing that these slaves had been
accustomed from childhood to obey the commanding
voice of the white man, young or old, he foolishly
fancied that my parents would give up the pursuit of
freedom for themselves and their child at <hi rend="italics">his bidding.
They thought otherwise;</hi> and when he dismounted, for
the purpose of enforcing authority and compelling
obedience by the use of the whip, he received so
severe a flogging at the hands of my parents as sent
him home nearly a cripple. He conveyed word as to our
flight, but prudently said he received his hurts by
<pb id="ward25" n="25"/>
his horse plunging, and throwing him suddenly against
a large tree. Through this young man our owners got
at the bottom of their loss. There was the loss of the
price of my mother, the loss of my present and
prospective self, and, what they had had no reason 
before to suspect, the loss of my father! Some say it 
was the commencement of a series
of adversities from which neither the estate nor the
owners ever afterwards recovered. I confess to
sufficient selfishness never to have shed a tear, either
upon hearing this or in subsequent reflections upon it.</p>
          <p>After this nothing serious befell our party, and
they safely arrived at Greenwich, Cumberland County,
early in the year 1820. They found, as they had been
told, that at Springtown, and Bridgetown, and other
places, there were numerous coloured people; that the
Quakers in that region were truly, practically friendly,
“not loving in word and tongue,” but in deed and truth;
and that there were no slaveholders in that part of the
State, and when slave-catchers came prowling about
the Quakers threw all manner of <hi rend="italics">peaceful</hi> obstacles in
their way, while the Negroes made it a little too <hi rend="italics">hot</hi> for
their comfort.</p>
          <p>We lived several years at Waldron's Landing, in
the neighbourhood of the Reeves, Woods, Bacons,
and Lippineutts, who were among my father's very
<pb id="ward26" n="26"/>
best friends, and whose children were among my
schoolfellows. However, in the spring and summer of
1826, so numerous and alarming were the
depredations of kidnapping and slave-catching in the
neighbourhood, that my parents, after keeping the
house armed night after night, determined to remove
to a place of greater distance and greater safety. Being
accommodated with horses and a waggon by kind
friends, they set out with my brother in their arms for
New York City, where they arrived on the 3rd day of
August, 1826, and lodged the first night with relations,
the parents of the Rev. H. H. Garnett, now of
Westmoreland, Jamaica. Here we found some 20,000
coloured people. The State had just emancipated all
its slaves—viz., on the fourth day of the preceding 
month—and it was deemed safer to live in such a city than in a
more open country place, such as we had just left.
Subsequent events, such as the ease with which my
two relatives were taken back in 1828—the truckling of
the mercantile and the political classes to the slave
system—the large amount of slaveholding property
owned by residents of New York—and, worst, basest,
most diabolical of all, the cringing, canting, hypocritical
friendship and subserviency of the religious classes to
slavery—have entirely dissipated that idea.</p>
          <p>I look upon Greenwich, New Jersey, the place
<pb id="ward27" n="27"/>
of my earliest recollections, very much as most
persons remember their native place. There I followed
my dear father up and down his garden, with fond
childish delight; the plants, shrubs, flowers, &amp;c., I
looked upon as of his creation. There he first taught me
some valuable lessons—the use of the hoe, to spell in
three syllables, and to read the first chapter of John's
Gospel, and my figures; then, having exhausted his
literary stock upon me, he sent me to school. There I
first read the Bible to my beloved mother, and read in
her countenance (what I then could not read in the book)
what that Bible was to her. Were my native country
<hi rend="italics">free,</hi> I could part with any possession to become the
owner of that, to me, most sacred spot of earth, my
father's old garden. Had I clung to the use of the hoe,
instead of aspiring to a love of books, I might by this
time have been somebody, and the reader of this
volume would not have been solicited by this means
to consider the lot of the oppressed American Negro.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
          <head>STRUGGLES AGAINST THE PREJUDICE OF COLOUR.</head>
          <p>I GREW up in the city of New York as do the children of
poor parents in large cities too frequently. I was
placed at a public school in Mulberry Street, taught by
Mr. C. C. Andrew, and subsequently by Mr. Adams, a
Quaker gentleman, from both of whom I received great
kindness. Dr. A. Libolt, my last preceptor in that
school, placed me under lasting obligations. Poverty
compelled me to work, but inclination led me to study;
hence I was enabled, in spite of poverty, to make some
progress in necessary learning. Added to poverty,
however, in the case of a black lad in that city, is the
ever-present, ever-crushing Negro-hate, which
hedges up his path, discourages his efforts, damps
his ardour, blasts his hopes, and embitters his spirits.</p>
          <p>Some white persons wonder at and condemn the
tone in which some of us blacks speak of our
oppressors. Such persons talk as if they knew but
little of human nature, and less of Negro
<pb id="ward29" n="29"/>
character, else they would wonder rather that, what with
slavery and Negro-hate, the mass of us are not either
depressed into idiocy or excited into demons. What
class of whites, except the Quakers, ever spoke of <hi rend="italics">their</hi>
oppressors or wrongdoers as mildly as we do? This
peculiarly American spirit (which Englishmen easily
enough imbibe, after they have resided a few days in
the United States) was ever at my elbow. As a servant,
it denied me a seat at the table with my white fellow
servants; in the sports of childhood and youth, it was
ever disparagingly reminding me of my colour and
origin; along the streets it ever pursued, ever ridiculed,
ever abused me. If I sought redress, the very
complexion I wore was pointed out as the best reason
for my seeking it in vain; if I desired to turn to account a
little learning, in the way of earning a living by it, the
idea of employing a black clerk was preposterous—too
absurd to be seriously entertained. I never knew but
one coloured clerk in a mercantile house. Mr. W. L.
Jeffers was lowest clerk in a house well known in Broad
Street, New York; but he never was advanced a single
grade, while numerous white lads have since passed up
by him, and over him, to be members of the firm. Poor
Jeffers, till the day of his death, was but one remove
above the porter. So, if I sought a trade, white
apprentices would
<pb id="ward30" n="30"/>
leave if I were admitted; and when I went to the house
of God, as it was called, I found all the Negro-hating
usages and sentiments of general society there
encouraged and embodied in the Negro pew, and in
the disallowing Negroes to commune until <hi rend="italics">all the
whites,</hi> however poor, low, and degraded, had done. I
know of more than one coloured person driven to the
total denial of all religion, by the religious barbarism of
white New Yorkers and other Northern champions of
the slaveholder.</p>
          <p>However, at the age of sixteen I found a friend in
George Atkinson Ward, Esq., from whom I received
encouragement to persevere, in spite of Negro-hate. In
1833 I became a clerk of Thomas L. Jennings, Esq.,
one of the most worthy of the coloured race;
subsequently my brother and I served David Ruggles,
Esq., then of New York, late of Northampton,
Massachusetts, now no more.</p>
          <p>In 1833 it pleased God to answer the prayers of my
parents, in my conversion. My attention being turned
to the ministry, I was advised and recommended by
the late Rev. G. Hogarth, of Brooklyn, to the
teachership of a school for coloured children,
established by the munificence of the late Peter
Remsen, Esq., of New Town, N.Y. The most distinctive
thing I can say of myself, in this my first attempt at the
profession of a pedagogue, is
<pb id="ward31" n="31"/>
that I succeeded Mr., now the Rev. Dr., Pennington. I
afterwards taught for two-and-a-half years in Newark,
New Jersey, where I was living in January 1838, when I
was married to Miss Reynolds, of New York; and in
October 1838 Samuel Ringgold Ward the younger was
born, and I became, “to all intents, constructions, and
purposes whatsoever,” a family man, aged twenty-one
years and twelve days.</p>
          <p>In May, 1839, I was licensed to preach the gospel by
the New York Congregational Association, assembled
at Poughkeepsie. In November of the same year, I
became the travelling agent of first the American and
afterwards the New York Anti-slavery Society; in
April, 1841, I accepted the unanimous invitation of the
Congregational Church of South Butler, Wayne Co.,
N.Y., to be their pastor; and in September of that year I
was publicly ordained and inducted as minister of that
Church. I look back to my settlement among that dear
people with peculiar feelings. It was my first charge: I
there first administered the ordinances of baptism and
the Lord's supper, and there I first laid hands upon and
set apart a deacon; there God honoured my ministry, in
the conversion of many and in the trebling the number
of the members of the Church, most of whom, I am
delighted to know, are still walking in the light of
<pb id="ward32" n="32"/>
God. The manly courage they showed, in calling and
sustaining and honouring as their pastor a black man,
in that day, in spite of the too general Negro-hate
everywhere rife (and as professedly pious as rife)
around them, exposing them as it did to the taunts,
scoffs, jeers, and abuse of too many who wore the
cloak of Christianity—entitled them to what they will
ever receive, my warmest thanks and kindest love. But
one circumstance do I regret, in connection with the
two-and-a-half years I spent among them—that was, not
the poverty against which I was struggling during the
time, nor the demise of the darling child I buried among
them: it was my exceeding great inefficiency, of which
they seemed to be quite unconscious. Pouring my
tears into their bosoms, I ask of them and of God
forgiveness. I was their first pastor, they my first
charge. Distance of both time and space has not yet
divided us, and I trust will ever leave us one in heart
and mind.</p>
          <p>Having contracted a disease of the uvula and
tonsils, which threatened to destroy my usefulness as
a speaker, with great reluctance I relinquished that
beloved charge in 1843, and in December of that year
removed to Geneva, where I commenced the study of
medicine with Doctors Williams and Bell. The skill of
my preceptors, with God's blessing, prevailing over
my disorder, I was enabled to
<pb id="ward33" n="33"/>
speak occasionally to a small Church in Geneva, while
residing there; and finally to resume public and
continuous anti-slavery labours, in connection with
the Liberty Party, in 1844. In 1846 I became pastor of
the Congregational Church in Cortland Village, New
York, where some of the most laborious of my services
were rendered, and where I saw more of the
foolishness, wickedness, and at the same time the
invincibility, of American Negro-hate, than I ever saw
elsewhere. Would that I had been more worthy of the
kindness of those who invited me to that place—of
those friends whom I had the good fortune to win
while I lived there—especially of those who showed me
the most fraternal kindness during the worst, longest
illness I have suffered throughout life, and while
passing through severe pecuniary troubles. My
youngest son, William Reynolds Ward, is buried
there; and there were born two of my daughters, Emily
and Alice, the former deceased, the latter still living.</p>
          <p>From Cortland we removed to Syracuse in 1851,
whence, on account of my participating in the “Jerry
rescue case,” on the first day of October in that year,
it became quite expedient to remove <hi rend="italics">in some haste</hi> to
Canada, in November. During the last few years of my
residence in the United States I was editor and
proprietor of two newspapers, both of which I survive,
and in both of which
<pb id="ward34" n="34"/>
I sunk every shred of my property. While at this
business, it seemed necessary that I should know
something of law. For this purpose, I commenced the
reading of it: but I beg to say, that after smattering
away, or teaching, law, medicine, divinity, and public
lecturing, I am neither lawyer, doctor, teacher, divine,
nor lecturer; and at the age of eight-and-thirty I am
glad to hasten back to what my father first taught me,
and from what I never should have departed—the tilling
of the soil, the use of the hoe.</p>
          <p>I beg to conclude this chapter by offering to all
young men three items of advice, which my own
experience has taught me:—</p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item>1. FIND YOUR OWN APPROPRIATE PLACE OF
DUTY.</item>
            <item>2. WHEN YOU HAVE FOUND IT, BY ALL

            <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
            <head>ANTI-SLAVERY: WHAT?</head>
            <p>IT may be thought that the biographical portion of
this volume is brief and summary; but it will be
seen, as we proceed, that some points, deserving
more attention, belong more properly to other parts
of the work. In proceeding to write about my 
anti-slavery labours, I may be allowed to give my own
definition of them. I regard all the upright demeanour, 
gentlemanly bearing, Christian character,
social progress, and material prosperity, of every
coloured man, especially if he be a native of the
United States, as, in its kind, anti-slavery labour.
The enemies of the Negro deny his capacity for 
improvement or progress; they say he is deficient in
morals, manners, intellect, and character. Upon
that assertion they base the American doctrine,
proclaimed with all effrontery, that the Negro is
neither fit for nor entitled to the rights, immunities 
and privileges, which the same parties say belong 
naturally to <hi rend="italics">all men;</hi> indeed, some of them go
<pb id="ward38" n="38"/>
so far as to deny that the Negro belongs to the human
family. In May, 1851, Dr. Grant, of New York, argued to
this effect, to the manifest delight of one of the largest
audiences ever assembled in Broadway Tabernacle.
True, two coloured gentleman, one of whom was
Frederic Douglass, Esq., refuted the abominable
theory; but Dr. Grant left, it is to be feared, his
impression upon the minds of too many, some of whom
wished to believe him. A very learned divine in New
Haven, Connecticut, declared, to the face of my
honoured friend, Rev. S. E. Cornish, that “neither
wealth nor education nor RELIGION could fit the Negro
to live upon terms of equality with the white man.”
Another Congregational clergyman of Connecticut told
the Writer, in the presence of the Rev. A. G. Beeman,
that in his opinion, were Christ living in a house
capable of holding two families, he would object to a
black family in the adjoining apartments. Mr. Cunard
objected to my taking a passage on any other terms—in
a British steamer, be it remembered; and Mr. Cunard is
an Englishman—than that I should not offend
Americans by presenting myself at the cabin <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fre">table
d'hôte.</foreign></hi> I could number six Americans who left Radley's
Hotel, while I was boarding there, because I was
expected to eat in the same coffee-room with them, at a
separate table, twenty feet distant from them, being
ignorant
<pb id="ward39" n="39"/>
of their presence. In but five of the American States
are coloured persons allowed to vote on equal terms
with whites. From social and business circles the
Negro is entirely excluded—no, not that; he is not
admitted—as a rule.</p>
            <p>Now, surely, all this is not attributable to the fact
that the Americans hold slaves, for the very worst of
these things are done by non-slaveholders, in 
non-slaveholding States; and Englishmen, Irishmen, and
Scotchmen, generally become the bitterest of Negro-haters, 
within fifteen days of their naturalization—some
not waiting so long. Besides, in other slaveholding
countries—Dutch Guiana, Brazil, Cuba, &amp;c.—free
Negroes are not treated thus, irrespective of character
or condition. It is quite true that, as a rule, American
slaveholders are the worst and the most cruel, both to
their own mulatto children and to other slaves; it is
quite true, that nowhere in the world has the Negro so
bitter, so relentless enemies, as are the Americans; but
it is not because of the existence of slavery, nor of the
evil character or the lack of capacity on the part of the
Negro. But, whatever is or is not the cause of it, there
stands the fact; and this feeling is so universal that
one almost regards ‘American’ and ‘Negro-hater’ as
synonymous terms.</p>
            <p>My opinion is, that much of this difference between
the Anglo-Saxon on the one and his brother
<pb id="ward40" n="40"/>
Anglo-Saxon on the other side of the Atlantic is to be
accounted for in the very low origin of early American
settlers, and the very deficient cultivation as
compared with other nations, to which they have not
attained. I venture this opinion upon the following
considerations. The early settlers in many parts of
America were the very lowest of the English
population: the same class will abuse a Negro in
England or Ireland now. The New England States were
settled by a better class. In those States the Negro is
best treated, excepting always the State of
Connecticut. The very lowest of all the early settlers
of America were the Dutch. These very same Dutch,
as you find them now in the States of New York, New
Jersey, and Pennsylvania, out-American all
Americans, save those of Connecticut, in their
maltreatment of the free Negro. The middling and
better classes of all Europe treat a black gentleman as
a gentleman. Then step into the British American
colonies, and you will find the lowest classes and
those who have but recently arisen therefrom, just
what the mass of Yankees are on this matter. Also,
the best friends the Negro has in America are persons
generally of the superior classes, and of the best
origin. These are facts. The conclusion I draw from
them may be erroneous, but it is submitted that it may
be examined.</p>
            <pb id="ward41" n="41"/>
            <p>We expect, generally, that the progress of
Christianity in a country will certainly, however
gradually, undermine and overthrow customs and
usages, superstitions and prejudices, of an unchristian
character. That this contempt of the Negro is
unchristian, perhaps I shall be excused from stooping
to argue. But, alas! <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">pari passu</foreign></hi> with the spread of what
the pulpit renders current as Christianity in my native
country, is the growth, diffusion, and perpetuity of
hatred to the Negro; indeed, one might be almost
tempted to accredit the words of one of the most
eloquent of Englishmen, who, more than twenty years
ago, described it in few but forcible terms—“the 
Negro-hating Christianity.” <hi rend="italics">Religion,</hi> however, should be
substituted for Christianity; for while a religion may be
from man, and a religion from such an origin
may be capable of <hi rend="italics">hating,</hi> Christianity is always from
God, and, like him, is love. “He who hateth his
brother abideth in darkness.” “Love is the fulfilling of
the law.” Surely it is with no pleasure that I say, from
experience, deep-wrought conviction, that the 
oppression and the maltreatment of the hapless 
descendant of Africa is not merely an ugly excrescence 
upon American <hi rend="italics">religion</hi>—not a blot
upon it, not even an anomaly, a contradiction, and an
admitted imperfection, a deplored weakness—a
lamented form of indwelling, an easily 
<pb id="ward42" n="42"/>
besetting, sin; no, it is a part and parcel of it, a cardinal
principle, a <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">sine quâ non,</foreign></hi> a cherished defended
keystone, a corner-stone, of American faith—all the
more so as it enters into the practice, the everyday
practice, of an overwhelming majority (equal to 
ninety-nine hundredths) of its professors, lay and 
clerical, of all denominations; not excepting, too, many 
of the Quakers! How these people will get on in Heaven, 
into which sovereign, abounding, divine mercy admits
blacks as well as whites, I know not; but Heaven is not
the only place to which either whites or blacks will
enter after the judgment!</p>
            <p>In view of such a conclusion, what is anti-slavery
labour? Manifestly the refutation of all this miserable
nonsense and heresy—for it is both. How is this to be
done? Not alone by lecturing, holding anti-slavery
conventions, distributing anti-slavery tracts,
maintaining anti-slavery societies, and editing 
anti-slavery journals, much less by making a trade of these,
for certain especial pets and favourites to profit by
and in which to live in luxury; but, in connection with
these labours, right and necessary in themselves,
effective as they must be when properly pursued, the
cultivation of all the upward tendencies of the
coloured man. I call the expert black cordwainer,
blacksmith, or other mechanic or artisan, the teacher,
the lawyer, the
<pb id="ward43" n="43"/>
doctor, the farmer, or the divine, an anti-slavery
labourer; and in his vocation from day to day, with his
hoe, hammer, pen, tongue, or lancet, he is living down
the base calumnies of his heartless adversaries—he is
demonstrating his truth and their falsity: indeed, all the
labour which falls short of this—much more, such as
does not tend in this direction—must, from the nature of
the case and the facts and demands of the cause, be
defective, lamentably defective, to use no stronger
term. I shall be understood, I hope, then, if I include
the chief facts of my life, whether in the editorial chair,
in the pulpit, on the platform, pleading for this cause
or that, in my anti-slavery labours. God helping me
wherever I shall be, at home, abroad, on land or sea, in
public or private walks, as a man, a Christian,
especially as a <hi rend="italics">black man,</hi> my labours must be 
anti-slavery labours, because mine must be an anti-slavery
life.</p>

            <head>WORK BEGUN.</head>
            <p>I SHALL not inflict the dry details of a journal upon
my readers. Treating of my labours in the American
States, in this part I shall briefly speak of the incidents
which in Providence led to my entering upon the
lecturing field, those connected with my settlement in
the ministry, and some events occurring in the course
of both, and the reasons for the termination of those
labours.</p>
            <p>That the announcement of a meeting for the
formation of an anti-slavery society should create a
sensation among the coloured people of New York no
one will wonder. Having been abused, and befooled,
and slandered, disparaged, ridiculed,
and traduced, by the Colonizationists, we could not
but look on, first, with very great distrust upon any
persons stepping forward with schemes professedly
for our good. But a young printer had suffered
imprisonment in Baltimore, for exposing there what
Clarkson had long before exposed in Liverpool—viz.,
the paraphernalia of a systematic,
<pb id="ward45" n="45"/>
authorized, lucrative slave trade; and this young man
being released through the munificence of one of our
then wealthiest Pearl Street merchants, we could not
doubt the real motives of either of these. Garrison
would not suffer imprisonment in our behalf,
insincerely; Arthur Tappan would not liberate Garrison
from imprisonment, <hi rend="italics">on such a charge,</hi> at the cost of
one thousand dollars, insincerely; indeed, we know
too well that no white man would suffer for our sakes,
without more than ordinary philanthropy. These
gentlemen deserved, and they received, our
confidence. In 1830 I heard, in New Haven,
Connecticut, at the Temple Street Coloured
Congregational Church, the Rev. Simeon S. Jocelyn
preach. I learned that, when a young man, a bank-note
engraver by trade, he studied theology and entered the
ministry, on purpose to serve the coloured people.
When a lecture was announced to be delivered on the
subject of slavery by that gentleman, I was but too
glad to hear him. I learned to love him as a child; I now
have the honour of his friendship as a man. His was
the first anti-slavery lecture I ever heard, and it was
delivered in 1834. In the spring of the same year
Professor E. Wright, jun., who had been in the
enjoyment of a Professorship in a Western College,
but relinquished it, and with it surrendered a salary of
eleven hundred dollars
<pb id="ward46" n="46"/>
for one of four hundred, that he might be at liberty
to serve the anti-slavery cause, lectured upon the
same subject. I was among his many delighted
auditors. The same gentleman is now E. Wright,
Esq., of Boston, the Douglas Jerrold of America.
A lawyer well known to fame, David Paul Brown,
Esq., of Philadelphia, was always ready to render
his peerless services in defence of any person
claimed as a slave. On the fourth day of July,
1834, this gentleman was invited to deliver an
anti-slavery oration in Chatham Chapel,  and, of
course, the coloured people mustered in strong
array to hear so well known a champion of 
freedom; but the meeting was dispersed by a mob,
gathered and sustained by the leading commercial
and political men and journals of that great city.
It was Independence Day—a day, of all days,
sacred to freedom. What Mr. Brown came to tell
us was, that the principles, enunciated in few words, 
in the Declaration of Independence—“We hold these 
truths to be self-evident truths, that all men are created
equal, and are endowed by their Creator with certain
inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness”—applied as well to black men
as to white men. This the aristocracy of New York
could not endure; and therefore, just fifty-eight years
from the very hour that the Declaration of 1776
<pb id="ward47" n="47"/>
was made, the mob of the New York merchants broke
up this assembly.</p>
            <p>On the 7th of the same month the coloured people
held a meeting in the same place, to listen to an
address from one of the ablest of their number,
Benjamin F. Hughes, Esq. That meeting was dispersed
by a mob led by a person holding a lucrative political
office in the city. This <hi rend="italics">gentleman</hi> (I like to indulge in
poetry sometimes) thought to do as he pleased with
the blacks, kicking them about at will; and while Mr.
Hughes was speaking, ordered other parties to come in
and occupy the building. Seeing resistance made by
some of the coloured people, and fearing he might
receive a blow for a kick, he elevated a chair over his
head, and stood witnessing the <hi rend="italics">mêlée</hi> himself had
begun, when Mr. Jinnings knocked him over with a
well-aimed missile. Leaving his men to fight or run, as
might seem wisest, this general of the mob escaped
from a window 22 feet from the ground, injuring
himself so as to keep his house for a fortnight—in
his own person the leader of the mob and the only man
injured in the affray. The blacks were victors; every
white man was driven from the place. But while a few
of us lingered, a reinforcement of the white
belligerents came, and, finding some few lads of us in
the place, they drove us out with a rush to the door.
Then they 
<pb id="ward48" n="48"/>
commenced beating us in the most cowardly manner.
The public watchman arrested the parties beaten
 instead of those committing the assault, and it was 
my lot to be among the former number. For the crime 
of being publicly assaulted by several white persons, 
I was locked up in the watchhouse throughout the night. 
Shortly after my imprisonment, four others were brought 
into the same cell by the officers of peace and justice, 
for the same crime. In the meantime the mob went to the 
house of Lewis Tappan, Esq., broke it open, sacked it, and
burned the furniture. Mr. Tappan was brother and
partner of the gentleman who liberated Garrison; he
also believed in the Declaration of Independence;
hence the mutilation and burning of his property. My
oath of allegiance to the anti-slavery cause was taken in
that cell on the 7th of July, 1834. In the morning we
were brought before the police magistrate, with other
prisoners. Those against whom no one appeared, or
whom no one charged with any offence, were
discharged. None appeared against us. The watchman
who arrested us had no charge to bring: he simply
said, in the chaste diction of a New York official,
“Thur was a row in Chatham Chapel last night,
and these niggers was there.” The magistrate, a
sample specimen of the New York Dogberry, abused
us, and, instead of discharging us according
<pb id="ward49" n="49"/>
to law and custom, remanded us to Bridewell, to give
parties an opportunity of appearing against us. I never
knew the same course taken in any other case. To
Bridewell we went, and were put into a cell with
nineteen others. In a most filthy state was that cell. All
the occupants, besides my four companions, were
charged with crime—one with killing a man; and though
<hi rend="italics">we</hi> were searched before we were incarcerated, this
man had, and showed us, the knife with which he had
inflicted the murder. The murderer, Johnson, had been
fettered in the same cell, and we saw the chain by
which he had been fastened to the floor. When the
prison cup was offered us to drink from, and when the
prison food was brought us, feeling our innocence and
our dignity (lads of seventeen seldom lack the latter),
we refused both. About ten o'clock, my father and G.
A. Ward, Esq., procured my liberation, by paying the
turnkey. As an innocent subject, unrighteously
doomed to a felon's prison, without either accuser or
trial, when liberated, I should have gone out <hi rend="italics">free.</hi> My
fellow prisoners were liberated soon after. That
imprisonment initiated me into the anti-slavery
fraternity.</p>
            <p>In July, 1837, I was selected to deliver an oration
before a Literary Society of which I was a member. It
was my first public attempt at public speaking. Among
those present was Lewis Tappan, Esq.
<pb id="ward50" n="50"/>
In August of the same year I was invited to speak in
the Broadway Tabernacle. In 1839 I was engaged in
Poughkeepsie, as teacher of the Coloured Lancasterian
School. Anxious to pursue further studies, I applied to
one or two gentlemen for aid. One of them confessed
himself but a beginner in one of the branches in which
I had made some progress; and he soon after gave me
a deeper wound, and more severe discouragement,
than any other man ever did. A debate upon the peace
question was to occur, in a hall of which this gentleman
and I were joint proprietors for the time. I had another
engagement to speak, at some distance from home,
within a day or two of the time of the debate. This
gentleman urged my return in time to participate in the
discussion. I complied, went to the hall. A few only
attended; and after a little conversation instead of a
debate, it was concluded to form a Literary Society. My
friend was requested to pass a paper for the names of
such persons present as would enter such a society.
He did <hi rend="italics">not</hi> solicit my name. He came to me after the
proceeding had terminated, and said, “ Mr. Ward,
you must have noticed that I did not hand the paper to
you for your signature. I omitted you on
purpose, because I saw that if your name was taken
several of those present would bolt.” Then, thought
I, what is the use of my acting uprightly, seeking
<pb id="ward51" n="51"/>
to win fame, and gaining it, if in this country a
professed friend, a man who goes with me to the house
of God, hearing me preach, visits my house, after all
treads upon me to please his neighbours? My
determination was formed to leave the country. I
accordingly wrote to Mr. Burnley, of the Trinidad
Legislature, a relation of the late Joseph Hume, Esq.,
M.P., who kindly encouraged my going to that island. I
wrote also to Rev. Joshua Leavitt, asking for letters of
recommendation. Mr. L. deprecated my leaving
America, thinking I might be of some service to the 
anti-slavery cause. I wrote him again, bitterly stating my
utter despair of doing anything for myself or my
people amid so many discouragements. The reply I
received was an appointment as agent of the American
Anti-Slavery Society, to travel and lecture for them. I
accepted the appointment, my commission being
signed by Henry B. Stanton, Esq., who was <hi rend="italics">then,</hi> and
Hon. James Gillespie Birney, who <hi rend="italics">yet</hi> professes to be,
an abolitionist; these gentlemen being secretaries of
that Society; in the same capacity they came to
London, to attend the World's Anti-Slavery
Convention of 1840. Thus was I introduced into the
anti-slavery agency.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
            <head>THE FIELD OCCUPIED.</head>
            <p>IN November, 1839, I made my <hi rend="italics">début</hi> as a lecturer.
It cost me a great deal of effort and self-denial. My
youthful wife and my infant boy I must leave, to
go hundreds of miles, travelling in all weathers,
meeting all sorts of people, combatting some of the
most deeply seated prejudices, and in the majority of
instances denied the ordinary courtesies of civilized
life. I suffered more than can be here described.
At length I considered that every Christian has not
only <hi rend="italics">a</hi> cross to bear, but <hi rend="italics">his</hi> peculiar cross; and
that God, not man, must judge and decide in what
shape that cross must come: aye, and he too would
give grace to bear it. Thus fortified, I went forth;
and from that day to this I have never been able to
see this travelling, homeless, wandering part of the
work in any other light than a cross. No place <hi rend="italics">can</hi>
be a substitute for home, though the latter be a
hovel, the former a palace. No observer can enter
into one's inner feelings, live over again one's life,
as does the loving wife. In sickness, in sorrow, to
<pb id="ward53" n="53"/>
be away from home adds mountain weights to what
the wanderer's bosom must bear; and I may as well
add, that the poisoned tongue of censure—cool,
deliberate, granite-hearted censure—censure from
unbridled but professedly Christian tongues, to be
found alike on both sides of the Atlantic, even among
brethren and others—doth not diminish the rigour of
the cross.</p>
            <p>Still, with God's blessing I went forth, making my
first speech at a private house, and afterwards
speaking in public places until I become accustomed
somewhat to the sound of my own voice, and a little
skilled in the handling of the subject, receiving kind
encouragement from one friend and another; until,
being transferred to the service of the New York State
Society in December 1839, I had the unspeakable
pleasure of making the acquaintance of some of its
most distinguished members and officers, and, at the
same time, of avoiding official connection with the
quarrels which divided the Anti-Slavery Society in
1840, and the subsequent dissensions among them.</p>
            <p>This same December, 1839, was eventful as the
month in which I became personally acquainted with
Hon. Gerrit Smith, Rev. Beriah Green, and William
Goodell, Esq.—three men whose peers are not to be
found in New York or any other State.</p>
            <p>Gerrit Smith had not then been sent to Congress,
<pb id="ward54" n="54"/>
but he had shown himself every way qualified for the
highest seat in any legislature, for the highest office in
the gift of any people. Not that office would adorn or
ennoble him, but that, in office as everywhere else,
the majestic dignity of his mien, the easy, graceful
perfection of his manners, his highly cultivated
intellect, his rich and varied learning, his profoundly
instructive conversation, his princely munificence, the
natural stream springing in and flowing from a most
benevolent heart—and, above all, his sweet, childlike,
simple, earnest, constant piety, pervading his whole
life and sparkling in all he says or does—these traits
would have shed lustre upon any office, and have
made their possessor the most admired and most
attractive as they make him one of the very best of
men. In spite of all that was said of this gentleman by
his enemies during his short career in Congress,
fourteen years after the time I speak of, the very
bitterest of his foes—or, what is tantamount, the falsest
of his professed friends—were obliged to acknowledge
him to be one of the noblest of earth's noble sons.</p>
            <p>Never shall I forget the first time I heard that model
man speak. Standing erect, as he could stand no other
way, with his large, manly frame, graceful figure and
faultless mannerism, richly but plainly dressed, with a
broad collar and black ribbon upon his neck (his
invariable costume, whatever be
<pb id="ward55" n="55"/>
the prevailing fashion), his look, with his broad
intellectual face and towering forehead, was enough to
charm any one not dead to all sense of the beautiful;
and then, his rich, deep, flexible, musical voice, as
capable of a thunder-tone as of a whisper—a voice to
which words were suited, as it was suited to words;
but, most of all, the words, thoughts, sentiments,
truths and principles, he uttered—rendered me, and
thousands more with me, unable to sit or stand in any
quietness during his speech. This was in May, 1838.
Mr. Smith was speaking against American Negro-hate.
He is a descendant of the Dutch, who have
distinguished themselves as much for their ill nature
towards Negroes as for anything else. He belonged by
wealth and position to the very first circles of the old
Dutch aristocracy; he was the constant and admired
associate of the proudest Negro-haters on the face of
the earth; he had for years been a member of that most
unscrupulous band of organized, systematic, practical
promulgators of Negro-hate, the Colonization Society:
and yet, in Broadway Tabernacle, upon an antislavery
platform, in the city of New York (the worst city, save
Philadelphia, since the days of Sodom, on this
subject), Gerrit Smith stood up before four thousand
of his countrymen to denounce this their cherished,
honoured, they believe Christianized
<pb id="ward56" n="56"/>
vice. To mortal man it is seldom permitted to
behold a sight so full of or so radiant with moral
power and beauty. Among the things he said, I may
attempt to recall one sentiment—he asserted that, in
ordinary circumstances, a person does not and cannot
know how or what the Negro, the victim of this
fiendish feeling, has to endure. Englishmen coming to
America at first look upon it as a species of insanity.
We are not all conscious of what we are doing to our
poor coloured brother. “The time was, Mr. Chairman,”
said this prince of orators, “when I did not understand it; 
but when I came to put myself in my coloured brother's 
stead—when I imagined myself in <hi rend="italics">his</hi> position—when 
I sought to realize what he feels, and how he feels 
it—when, in a word, I became a COLOURED MAN—then 
I understood it, and learned how and why to hate it.”</p>
            <p>To enforce his personal illustration there was one
great fact. Mr. Smith had read of One “who made
himself of no reputation,” and he chose to imitate
Him. Long, long before the anti-slavery question
agitated the American mind, Mr. Smith and his
excellent lady had concluded that, by whomsoever
they might be visited, no coloured person should be
slighted or treated with any less respect in their
mansion because of his colour. Mr. and Mrs. Smith
knew that they were visited by some of the first
<pb id="ward57" n="57"/>
families of the land—they were such; their relatives
were such; and no inconsiderable number of them
were slaveholders. They knew what would be said;
but they also knew what was right, and upon that
principle had Mr. Smith invariably acted—scorning,
spurning, and trampling upon the vile demon of 
Negro-hate for twenty years before he made that ever
memorable speech. Such was his qualification to make
such a speech, in such a presence. Now, a man of no
position, a mere mechanic or artisan, who makes
himself by means of his cause, and who earns his
bread by his philanthropy, may talk cheaply enough
about what he dares and suffers for the poor slave;
but one who, in Mr. Smith's position, gives untold
wealth in lands and money, must be judged otherwise.
Mr. Smith has given 120,000 acres of land to coloured
people—has sacrificed his position, and, from sympathy with
the coloured people, has identified himself with them.
Here then we see philanthropy, real, pure, self-sacrificing
—philanthropy, indeed, such as very few in
any country exhibit, and fewer still in <hi rend="italics">that</hi> country.
But, God be praised, Gerrit Smith belongs to that few.
The honour and pleasure of making that gentleman's
acquaintance was mine in 1839, at his house, in
Peterborough. No honour I ever enjoyed do I esteem
more highly than that I may call the Honourable Gerrit
Smith my personal
<pb id="ward58" n="58"/>
friend. Of him I say, sometimes, he is the
Shaftesbury of America; and those who enjoy the
pleasure of knowing both know that I honour the
noble Earl in nothing more highly than in speaking of
his Lordship as the Gerrit Smith of England, of
Europe.</p>
            <p>The Rev. Beriah Green, President of Oneida
Institute (the <hi rend="italics">alma mater</hi> of several of my dear
schoolfellows, among them Henry Highland Garnet
and Alexander Crummell), was among the
acquaintances I had the privilege of making in 1839.
Few clergymen, of any denomination, in any country,
equal the profound, the learned, the original Beriah
Green. His love for humanity, especially the poorest
of the poor, is of the most ardent type. Upon its altar
he will lay salary, name, place, reputation, not only,
but submit to all manner of abuse and
misrepresentation, and toil at any kind of hard labour,
“for dear humanity's sake,” to use his own beautiful,
expressive, emphatic phrase. Such was this devoted
philanthropist, sixteen years ago; such is he now, in
spite of increasing years and undiminished sacrifices.
I never knew a person who put a higher estimate
upon simple manhood, and who relied upon the
simple truth more fully, than he. In argument, in
analyzing principles, in applying metaphysical tests, I
never saw nor read of his equal.</p>
            <pb id="ward59" n="59"/>
            <p>William Goodell, then the editor of the “Friend of
Man,” differs somewhat from both of his contemporaries, 
but he is a great man in all that makes a man
truly great. He has not the eloquence of Mr. Smith,
nor, technically speaking, the metaphysical acumen
and power of Mr. Green; but for pure, sound, strong
logic—for clear, consecutive reasoning—for the keen
ability to detect a fallacy, a sophism, a tendency to
defect or unsoundness—for a downright refinement and
sublimation, as well as an acute and well tempered use,
of common sense—William Goodell has not his
superior, if his equal, among all whom I have met on
either side of the Atlantic. If, then, these gentlemen
differ in taste, education, former pursuits, habits of
thought, and intellectual character, as doubtless they
do, they agree in one thing—the earnest, simple
devotion of the entire soul to the love of God and the
love of man.</p>
            <p>To have formed the acquaintance of these three
personages, to work under their advice and direction,
to acquire their friendship, and to be unconscious of
any diminution of it for sixteen years, was and is, to
me, a priceless privilege. This is the best apology I can
offer, if indeed any is needed, for occupying so much
of these pages in speaking of them. To know them is
to love them; and it is among the most pleasing of
one's anticipations of
<pb id="ward60" n="60"/>
the happiness of the future state, that eternity will be
enjoyed in such excellent association. Is it not one of
the highest proofs of the power of divine grace, that it
can and does furnish such specimens of redeemed
man, in the midst of a generation however wicked and
perverse? Is it not an earnest of God's favour to the
anti-slavery cause, that he calls into labour and
sacrifice gifts so sound, talent so exalted, intellects so
cultivated, piety so Christlike?</p>

            <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
            <head>THE ISSUE CONTEMPLATED.</head>
            <p>IT is a matter of surprise to people in England that the
Americans should profess so loudly the <hi rend="italics">Christian</hi>
religion, and insist so strongly upon republicanism as
the only proper form of government, and yet hold
slaves and treat Negroes, as they do, in the directest
possible opposition both to republicanism and
Christianity. The opposition which the citizens of the
United States, of both the North and the South, make
to the anti-slavery cause, is, to Europeans, an
inexplicable mystery. Far be it from me to attempt a
solution of it. I will endeavour to state the real issue
betwixt anti-slavery men and their opponents; and, in
doing so, I fear I shall make the matter more, instead of
less, mysterious.</p>
            <p>Those who recollect, or who have read of, the
opposition Clarkson, Wilberforce, and Buxton had to
encounter in their day, on the subject of the slave
trade, in the British senate, and from Englishmen
interested in the slave trade, know what
<pb id="ward62" n="62"/>
class of arguments were used against the measures of
righteousness advocated by them. Precisely the same
class of arguments have been made against the
abolition of slavery in the United States, by American
senators, and by American merchants, theologians,
and politicians: indeed, I have seen where the very
words used by His Royal Highness the Duke of
Clarence, against the abolition of the slave trade, were
uttered in the American Senate against the abolition of
slavery there. When the abolition of West India
slavery was urged by Brougham, Stanley, and others,
they in their turn were assailed with the same sort of
opposition which their anti-slavery fathers, so to
speak, met; and just such opposition have Sumner,
Wilson, Seward, Giddings, and others, to overcome in
the American Senate now. We explain the opposition
of British slaveholders and slave traders to abolition,
on the ground of interest, long continued use and
abuse of authority, degenerating into petty tyranny
and worse than brutal cruelty. These, however, sailed
under no flag of boasted freedom. They did not
clamour for the equality of all men. They found no
fault with other than republican forms of government.
They did not set themselves up as universal reformers.
They said but little—wisely—about religion, for they had
but little religion to talk about; and such as they had,
<pb id="ward63" n="63"/>
judging from their lives, was more honoured by
silence than profession.</p>
            <p>In America the case was different. Parties having the
least to do with the South, or with slavery, are among
the fiercest opposers of the anti-slavery cause. Ladies—
save the mark!—and gentlemen of the most amiable and
benevolent dispositions, such as contribute to every
local charity, listen to all the cries of misery from the Old
World, and honour all drafts made upon them for the
spread of the gospel among the distant heathen, are the
most active and, from their high religious position, the
most powerful abettors and defenders of the slave
system—not as it was in some ancient country two
thousand years ago, but as it is now in the United
States. Northern pulpit orators defend slavery from the
Bible, the Old Testament and the New; and this is not
true of one here and there only, it is so of the most
learned, most distinguished of them, of all
denominations. The very men who cater for British
popularity, are the loudest declaimers in favour of this
“domestic institution.” Another class of them maintain
the most studious silence concerning it. If they speak at
all, they condemn only “slavery in the abstract,” and
condemn abolition in the concrete. They neither hold
nor treat slavery as sinful; and when pressed, declare
that “<hi rend="italics">some</hi> sins are not to be preached against.” Such
was the
<pb id="ward64" n="64"/>
teaching of a distinguished theological professor to
his class in a “school of the prophets” in New York
State. Besides, all the machinery of the benevolent
societies is so framed, and set, and kept at work, as
not only not to interfere with slavery, but to pander to
it. The American Tract Society not only publishes no
tract against slavery, but they favour that abominable
system in the two following ways:—1. If an English
work which they republish has a line in it
discountenancing slavery, however indirectly, it is
either taken out, or so altered as to lose its force in
that particular direction. Their emasculation of 
“Gurney on the Love of God” is notorious. 2. They
refuse to publish a tract on the subject, when other
acknowledged Christians and Christian ministers
propose to write and prepare one, and defray the
expense of publishing the same. No, poor slave: dumb
as thou art, dumb shalt thou ever be, so far as this
Society is concerned.</p>
            <p>The American Bible Society distributes no Bibles
among the slave population. To do so, it is freely
admitted, were contrary to law in some States—not in
all. It is so in nine of the fifteen Slave States, but not in
the other six; and some of these laws were framed, and
all of them are upholden, and many of them
administered and executed, by members, friends, and
patrons of this Society. Not one
<pb id="ward65" n="65"/>
word ever escapes the lips of that Society, as such,
against these anti-Protestant laws! In 1841 I knew of
an agent of an auxiliary to that Society who was
distributing Bibles in Louisiana, and, being ignorant of
the laws upon the subject, asked a free coloured man if
he could read, with the intention of giving or selling
him a Bible if he could. Some one overheard him, and
informed against him. He was arrested, tried, found
guilty, but leniently discharged, on account of his
ignorance of the law which he had violated.
Slaveholders and their abettors belong to and are
officers of the American Bible Society, and they
control it. That slavery forbids the searching of the
Scriptures, which Christ enjoins, is to them not even a
matter of complaint. Albeit, they pledge themselves to
give the Christian Scriptures to every family in the
Union.</p>
            <p>The American Sunday-school Union stands in
precisely the same category, and is controlled by
precisely the same influences; and the American
Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions is, and
always has been, both in its policy and its officers, of
the very same character. The several religious bodies,
with their respective branches, of all denominations,
except the Quakers and the Free-Will Baptists
(although the majority of their numbers are Northern
men), are completely subject to the control of their
slaveholding members. But 
<pb id="ward66" n="66"/>
the most lamentable fact is, that in Congregational New
England the sons of Puritan sires are as guilty as the
guiltiest enemies of the down-trodden slave. Such was
the state of the case in 1839, when my labours began;
such, I regret to say, continues the case at this
moment: and here I will take the liberty of saying that,
although my connection with the New York State 
Anti-Slavery Society dissevered me from the division of the
abolitionists in 1840, and although I never belonged to
the Garrison branch of the abolitionists, so-called, I
will do them the justice to record, that the least,
slightest tendency towards infidelity, or even of
impatience with the Churches, was never seen or
suspected in them until after the New England clergy,
as a body, had taken ground distinctly and openly
against the anti-slavery cause (<hi lang="lat" rend="italics">vide</hi> Goodall's
“History of the Anti-Slavery Cause”).</p>
            <p>What reason is given for this strange action on the
part of religious denominations, benevolent
institutions, theological professors, and individual
clergymen? I will state it as fairly as I can.</p>
            <p>Their chief reason is, that it will disturb their
existing harmony so to take up, discuss, and consider
this question, as, it seems to abolitionists, its
importance demands. In the Churches, while they
maintain silence upon it, or ignore it altogether, they
have nothing to cause disagreement. This
<pb id="ward67" n="67"/>
question would be an apple of discord, as brethren of
equal piety would range themselves on opposite sides
of it. So it would be in the benevolent societies.
Harmony, peace, are sought in that country by
religious people, at almost any expense; slaveholders
are members of the different religious denominations;
in fact, one sixth of all the slaveholders belong to
Methodists, Baptists, Episcopalians, and
Presbyterians. To treat slavery as sinful, would
offend these brethren; and what is
the use of that? They are good Christians; they treat
their slaves well; and so long as they give
signs of piety, are regular in their standing, pious in
conversation, sound in doctrine, and correct in other
matters, save the one of slavery, why should they be
disturbed? why offend them?</p>
            <p>Some deny the sinfulness of slaveholding; others
shelter themselves behind the faults of the
abolitionists; others defend slaveholding from the
Bible; but I think their love of harmony is their chief
alleged reason for their present attitude. Let it not be
forgotten, however, that behind all this—and going
very far, I think, to explain it—is the contempt they all
alike maintain towards the Negro. Surely, if they
believed him to be an <hi rend="italics">equal brother man,</hi> such miserable 
pretexts for, and defences of, the doing of the mightiest 
wrongs against him, would never for a moment be thought of.</p>
            <pb id="ward68" n="68"/>
            <p>The abolitionists, on the other hand, point out the
intrinsic nature and character of slavery—not in the
abstract, but in the concrete—not as one might imagine
it to be, but as it <hi rend="italics">is</hi>—not as it was (or was not) two
thousand years ago, more or less, but as it is <hi rend="italics">to-day</hi>—
its brutalizing, chattelizing; buying, selling, the image
of God and the members of Christ's body; its adultery,
fornication, incest—and ask if religious men and
ministers are really serious in declaring <hi rend="italics">this</hi> to be no
sin? If not serious, is it not a matter too grave to jest
about? Violating, as it does, every part and parcel of
the Decalogue, could He who gave the law from Sinai
approve it? They point to the law of love, and ask,
Shall not our black brother receive the treatment, the
love, of a brother, as well as the Hindoo or the
Laplander? They point to the law which denies him the
Bible, and ask, Can the God of the Bible approve that
law? They hear Christ say, “Inasmuch as ye did it (or
did it not) to the least of these my brethren, ye did it
(or did it not) unto<hi rend="italics"> me.</hi>” Black men are, in the
estimation of these brethren who oppose the 
anti-slavery cause, “the least.” Should not religious men
tremble, lest the Son of Man should denounce these
terrible words against them?</p>
            <p>When told of the piety of slaveholding professors
of religion, they point to the acknowledged piety of
<pb id="ward69" n="69"/>
the Jewish Church; notwithstanding which God
denounced them for refusing “to break the yoke and
let the oppressed go free” (Isa. 1viii. 1-6). When the
harmony and peace of the Church are pleaded for,
against them, abolitionists plead for the “wisdom
which is from above, which is <hi rend="italics">first pure, then</hi>
peaceable.” When urged, as it frequently is, that it is
no part of the business of the Church, or her
benevolent handmaids, to speak against existing
social and political evils, abolitionists remind brethren
of the firm lodgment which the evils connected with
and inseparable from slavery have in the Church; so
that, as the gentle and gifted Birney hath it, “the
American Church is the bulwark of slavery:” so that,
as the amiable Barnes saith, “there is no power out of
the Church that could sustain slavery a twelvemonth,
if the Church should turn her artillery against it.”</p>
            <p>If abolitionists hear pro-slavery men say there are
sins which the Church and the Pulpit ought not and
need not rebuke, they point to the preaching of all the
true prophets, to the Lord, and to the apostles; all of
whom took especial pains to rebuke and to denounce
the specific forms of iniquity which, in their own times,
were most prevalent, most fashionable, most
profitable. This sin of oppression was not among the
least of them: so when told that some who denounce
slavery,
<pb id="ward70" n="70"/>
and at the same time inveigh against pro-slavery
Churches and ministers, are sceptics, it is with no sort
of pleasure that abolitionists recall the time when the
most prominent of this class, were as sound and
orthodox in their views of divine truth as any of their
accusers, and continued to be so until appalled and
disgusted by seeing how lamentably the class who
now cry out “Infidel!” exhibited that worst, most
delusive, most practical form of infidelity—the “holding of the truth in unrighteousness,” the
justifying of the foulest crimes (such as of necessity
enter into and form constituent elements of slavery)
by God's holy Word.</p>
            <p>Such was the issue betwixt the anti-slavery cause
and its religious opposers in 1839; such was it during
my humble advocacy of emancipation; and such were,
on the one side and on the other, the sort of
arguments I had to meet and to make; and such is the
issue between those who take opposite sides of this
great question in that country now—an issue neither
beginning nor ending with the rights and the liberties,
the weal or the woe, of the poor Negro; but an issue
involving the honour of Christ, the purity of the
Church, the character of God, and the nature of our
religion—of Christianity—and the influence of the
American people, religiously, at home and abroad.
What sort of Christ is he who, while professing to die
for the
<pb id="ward71" n="71"/>
<hi rend="italics">race,</hi> authorizes the exclusion of the coloured portion
thereof—at least three fourths—from the commonest
benefits of his salvation? Even such is the Christ of
American pro-slavery religion. What is the character
of that God who, giving a moral code from Sinai, right
in the fitness of things, as well as because an
emanation from himself and a transcript of his will, but
who authorizes one fourth of those upon whom he
makes that law binding to violate and trample under
foot every precept and principle of that code, touching
the other three fourths of their fellow men? Even that is
the character of the Deity, as seen in the light—or the
darkness—of a pro-slavery religion. How pure can that
Church be which smiles upon, fondles, caresses,
protects, and rejoices to defend, a system which
cannot exist without turning out a million and three
quarters of the women of the country to the unbridled
lusts of the men who hold despotic power over them?
some of these women, three hundred thousand, being
owned by members of the Church, and some sixty
thousand of these women being members of it too!
Such is the purity of the American pro-slavery Church.
What can be the nature of a religion with which all this
is consistent, and a part of which it is? Just such is the
nature of the pro-slavery religion of my native country;
and, what is more grievous to add, just so
<pb id="ward72" n="72"/>
far as it shall spread in heathen lands, just so far as it
passes current in Europe, just so far does this
blighting, withering influence go with it. Now,
abolitionists—Christian abolitionists—in America, are
contending as to whether the religion of Jesus, or that
which is fashionable about them, shall prevail over
themselves and their neighbours. They see that when
a system of religion becomes so corrupt as to uphold
and defend so abominable a system of iniquities as
slavery, it is not to be trusted upon anything else.
They know that if such a Church be not reformed it
must become a sort of mother of harlots, and all
manner of abominations. Whether that Church can be
reformed or not is, with them, still a question; with me
it is not. But I entreat the reader to look at the issue. It
is not whether some men have wisely or unwisely
pleaded this cause, nor whether their measures were
commendable or not; nor merely, what shall be done
with the Negro? It is, shall religion, pure and undefiled,
prevail in the land; or shall a corrupt, spurious, human
system, dishonouring to God and oppressive to man,
have the prevalence? That is the issue, “before Israel
and the sun.”</p>

            <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
            <head>THE POLITICAL QUESTION.</head>
            <p>IN like manner, the abolitionists, such as those
with whom it was my honour to be associated,
inquired how far they could wield their political
powers, with the parties of the day, innocently.
About the time to which I was referring—viz.,
1839-40—they began to see the great fact, that
the political parties of the country departed as
widely from the old maxims of democracy and
republicanism as did the Churches from the gospel.
They saw the North divided into two great parties,
wielding two thirds of the votes of the nation, each
of these having Southern members who controlled
them, and both of them catering for the largest
share of the Southern vote, which was about one
third of the entire suffrage. They saw the best,
highest offices, given freely to Southern men, on
purpose to propitiate the South; while the South
demanded and accepted this unnatural, undue, and
disproportioned amount of power and emolument,
both as the price of their aid to the party giving
<pb id="ward74" n="74"/>
them, and as a means of securing the interests of
slavery. Hence it was that the diplomatic agents
of the country were sure to be Southerners, or 
pro-slavery men. Who ever knew any other character
at the Court of St. James, or the Court of St.
Cloud? Hence it was, too, that ere a Northern
man could be qualified for any post of honour in
the national gift, he must prove himself to have
been always entirely free from the least taint of
abolitionism, or to have been thoroughly purged
of it, if he had ever been so much as reasonably
suspected of it. At the same time, in Northern
localities the friends and members of these parties
sought to cajole and seduce abolitionists into
voting with one or the other of them, under
the plea that <hi rend="italics">it</hi> was more favourable to the 
anti-slavery cause than its opposite, while manifestly
<hi rend="italics">both</hi> were the tools and the props of the slave
powers. Abolitionists did not fail to see, that
to vote with either of these parties was alike
repugnant to their cherished principles and to
their self-respect. Then, they must do one of
two things; either refrain from voting altogether,
or concentrate their votes upon candidates of their
own selection—in other words, form a political party
upon anti-slavery principles. They adopted, wisely,
the latter. That party was formed in August, 1840, at
Syracuse. I then became, for
<pb id="ward75" n="75"/>
the first time, a member of a political party. With it I
cast my first vote; to it I devoted my political
activities; with it I lived my political life—which
terminated when, eleven years subsequently, I left the
country.</p>
            <p>As the abolitionists saw the Churches were
trampling under foot the fundamental principles of
Christianity, touching slavery, so they saw the
Government and the political parties to be false to their
own sworn principles of freedom and democracy. They
departed from the constitution, which was made  “to
secure the blessings of liberty,” and which ordained
that “no man shall be deprived of liberty without due
process of law.” The Whigs denied the faith of their
revolutionary fathers, whose Whiggism was but
another name for self-sacrificing love of liberty. The
Democrats, claiming Jefferson as their father and
boasting of his having written the Declaration of
Independence, hated nothing so intensely as
Jefferson's writings against slavery—and that very
Declaration of Independence, when, among “ALL MEN”
in it declared to be entitled by God to the <hi rend="italics">unalienable</hi>
right to liberty, Negroes were said to be included. Both
professed to be admirers of the great Washington; but
neither of them, like him, coveted the opportunity of
using his political power against slavery in his native
State. What the abolitionists then
<pb id="ward76" n="76"/>
demanded, and now contend for, is the simple
application of the principles of the Declaration of
Independence to the black as well as the white, and
that the former should share the benefits secured by
the constitution as well as the latter. Believing just
what the Declaration of Independence says, that the
right of man to liberty is <hi rend="italics">unalienable,</hi> they hold that
no enactments, no constitutions, no consent of the
man himself, no combinations of men, can alienate that
which is by God's <hi rend="italics">fiat</hi> made <hi rend="italics">unalienable.</hi> They agree
with England's greatest living jurist, Brougham, that
the idea that man can be the property of man is to be
rejected as a “wild and guilty phantasy”: neither
overlooking nor neglecting other great questions with
which governments and parties have to do, they make
their basis principle the <hi rend="italics">unalienable</hi> right of man “to
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” It was to
the promulgation of these political principles, and of
those religious principles to which I referred in the
preceding pages, that, as an agent of the New York
State Anti-Slavery Society, it was my duty and my
pleasure to devote myself. This duty brought me into
contact with all classes of the enemies of the cause—
made me familiar with all the different objections urged
against it on the one hand; and it gave me the 
ever-to-be-remembered pleasure of meeting all
<pb id="ward77" n="77"/>
classes of abolitionists, profiting by their suggestions,
accepting their hospitalities, rejoicing in their
sympathies, and sharing their devotions. A truer, a
more discerning set of men, America does not hold.
They are fully alive to the issue before them. They see
that, if the principle be admitted that a black man may
be legally, righteously enslaved, so may any other man;
that slavery is altogether regardless of the colour of its
victims: that its encroachments upon the right of
petition, the freedom of the press, the freedom of
speech—its whipping, tarring and feathering, and
lynching, <hi rend="italics">white</hi> abolitionists at the South—its
enslavement of the light-coloured children of white
men—its unscrupulous, insatiate demands, nature,
character—all make it the enemy of any and every class
opposing it, willing to jeopard and to destroy the
liberties of any whom it can crush as its victims. They
see that the real political issue is, not whether the
black man's slavery shall be perpetuated, but whether
the freedom of any Americans can be permanent.
Blessings on the men who, at all hazards, are prepared
to welcome and to meet that issue, with all its sacrifices
and all its consequences! Whether they succeed or
not, whether there is sufficient soundness and vitality
in the republic to admit of its being saved or not, they,
let the worst come, will ever bear in their bosoms the
satisfaction of
<pb id="ward78" n="78"/>
having done their duty in times of the utmost trial.
Yea, blessings on that fearless band! </p>
            <p>Allow me once more to state, what I fear Englishmen
but too seldom and too slightly consider—1. The
religious issue betwixt the American antislavery men
and their opposers is deep, radical, vital, involving the
religious weal or woe of the American Church. 2. The
political issue is as deep, radical, and vital, in its kind:
involving the safety, the stability—not the unity alone,
but the very existence, of the republic. It is not like the
emancipation question in Great Britain, or the corn-law
question, or the reform question. It is not, What are
the powers and scope of the Government, to what limit
do they extend, to what classes do they apply, and of
what improvements are they capable? It is a question
affecting all classes, involving the fate of the whole
people, undermining the basis of their best
institutions, lying at the root of all constitutional
government, and in its grasp including the whole
range of American rights.</p>

            <pb id="ward79" n="79"/>
            <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
            <head>THE WHITE CHURCH AND COLOURED PASTOR.</head>
            <p>IT was while journeying through Western New York,
promulgating such doctrines as the above, that I went
by appointment to the township of Butler, in the
county of Wayne, on a certain Saturday in February,
1841. The meeting was attended by some steady
honest farmers and others, with their wives and
daughters. It was holden in the Congregational
Church. As was and still is the custom in that region,
the lecturer was invited to tea by a gentleman of
prominence in the neighbourhood—George Candee,
Esq., who had a heart warm in the anti-slavery cause.
At the invitation of several members of the Church, I
remained and preached the following day in the
forenoon, having an engagement seven miles distant
in the evening.</p>
            <p>As they were without either a pastor or a supply,
several members of the Church accompanied me to
Wolcott in the evening. On the way, one of the
number said something about my settling with them.
Thinking it a matter which would not survive
<pb id="ward80" n="80"/>
the excitement of the moment, I simply gave them
the liberty to write to me at Peterborough, my
residence. In a few days a letter came; and
shortly after, another, from Clarendon Campbell,
Esq., M.D., the postmaster, one of the most pious
and intelligent members of the Church, inviting 
me formally and officially to settle.</p>
            <p>I went to visit them in April, and a series of
meetings began which was not discontinued until
several persons were converted to God, through
Christ's redemption, and I had been called and
had agreed to become their pastor.</p>
            <p>The Church and congregation were all white
persons save my own family. It was “a new thing
under the sun” to see such a connection.
The invitation was unanimous and cordial; and not
one incident occurred during my settlement, on the
part of any <hi rend="italics">living</hi> members, to make it even seem to
be otherwise. Having spoken elsewhere
touching this relation, I choose not here to repeat
myself; but I will add, the novelty of such a settlement
attracted a great deal of notice, and a great 
many remarks <hi rend="italics">pro</hi> and <hi rend="italics">con.</hi> I understood it to be
a matter of vast importance, how I should demean
myself in so responsible a position; for I felt it to
be such, in two very important points of view—
first, in regard to the anti-slavery cause generally;
and secondly, in reference to the coloured people
<pb id="ward81" n="81"/>
especially. If I should acquit myself creditably as a
preacher, the anti-slavery cause would thereby be
encouraged. Should I fail in this, that sacred cause
would be loaded with reproach. So, if I were successful
or unsuccessful in this charge would <hi rend="italics">encouragement</hi> or
<hi rend="italics">discouragement</hi> come to the people of colour. In the one
case, the traducers and disparagers of the Negro would
say, “Said we not truly when we affirmed that nothing
could be made of, or done with, the Negro? Such a one
was actually placed in such a position; but so
inveterate and unconquerable were the degrading
tendencies of the Negro, that he could not sustain
himself.” Then whoever pleaded for Negro equality
would be pointed to my failure as a perfect refutation of
his doctrine, and a complete and triumphant answer to
his argument. On the other hand, if I did succeed, some
other young black would feel encouraged to qualify
himself for a position of usefulness among his own
people; but while appropriately serviceable to them, he
might also be so situated as to do good <hi rend="italics">to</hi> others and
<hi rend="italics">for</hi> his own class. I was not willing to do mischief to the
dear anti-slavery cause, nor to that of my beloved
people. I hope God spared me from either—from both.
Or, at any rate, among the many things wherewithal I
have been reproached, this is not one of them.</p>
            <pb id="ward82" n="82"/>
            <p>During my residence in South Butler, I was
frequently called upon to speak, lecture, and preach,
elsewhere. Thus were afforded me numerous
opportunities of making known to others than my own
congregation the gospel of Jesus; and of spreading
before others than those of my own neighbourhood
what were the doctrines of the abolitionists, and the
duties of American citizens, in regard to those
doctrines. I had the pleasure of seeing principles of
importance taking root, springing up, and becoming
productive, and scattering seed upon fresh soil. While
I cannot agree with some as to the good results and
wide extent of my labours, I certainly hope that some
good was done. That hope is more based upon the
peculiar character of the people of my charge, and
those among whom I travelled, than upon anything I
was enabled to do. My own people were honest,
straightforward, God-fearing descendants of New
England Puritans. Living in the interior of the State,
apart from the allurements and deceptions of fashion,
they felt at liberty to hear, judge, and determine for
themselves, and to act in accordance with what the
Bible, as they understood it, demanded of them. They
heard a preacher: they supposed and believed that he
preached God's truth. That was what they wanted, and
all they wanted. The mere accident of the <hi rend="italics">colour</hi> of the
<pb id="ward83" n="83"/>
preacher was to them a matter of small consideration.
Some might ridicule: indeed, some did. But what of
that? They received the truth, and it was of sufficient
value to enable them to endure ridicule for its sake.
Anti-slavery doctrines were unpopular; anti-slavery
practice was still more so. But what said the Bible
about these doctrines? Did they agree with the law of
love? Were they in agreement with—or, what is more to
the point, part and parcel of—what Jesus taught? If so,
let rectitude take the place of popularity. They could
afford to do without the latter. So this honest, 
right-hearted people loved—so they stood by the pastor—so
their influence spread abroad—and so the Lord God of
Jacob blessed them, according to his gracious promise.</p>
            <p>When in South Butler, also, the people of my own
colour called upon me not unfrequently to visit and
labour among them. They seemed inclined to take
advantage of my position, to make it serviceable; and I
was but too happy to accede to their wishes. </p>
            <p>In doing so, I always sought to inculcate some
truth which would have a direct influence on our
character and our condition. Being deprived of the
right of voting upon terms of equality with 
whites—being denied the ordinary courtesies of decent
society, to say nothing of what is claimed for every
man, especially every freeborn American 
<pb id="ward84" n="84"/>
citizen—I very well know, from a deep and painful
experience, that the black people were goaded into a
constant temptation to hate their white fellow-citizens.
I know, too, how natural such hatred is in such
circumstances: and all I know of the exhibition of
vindictiveness and revenge by the whites against
<hi rend="italics">their</hi> injurers—and the most perfect justice of the
Negro regarding the white man according to daily
treatment received from him—caused me to see this
temptation to be all the stronger: and convinced me
also, that the white had no personal claim to anything
else than the most cordial hatred of the black.</p>
            <p>How frequently have I heard a Negro exclaim, “I
cannot like a white man. He and his have done so
much injury to me and my people for so many
generations.” How difficult, how impossible, to deny
this, with all its telling force of historical fact! How
natural is such a feeling, in such circumstances! How
richly the whites deserved it!</p>
            <p>My course was, however, to remind them of the
manner in which Christ had been treated by those for
whom he died, <hi rend="italics">ourselves included;</hi> to direct their
attention to the fact, that in the face of bad social
customs, and education, and religion, God enabled
<hi rend="italics">some whites</hi> to do and endure all things for our
cause, in its connection with their own; to assure
them that the number of such was constantly
increasing in our native country, while nearly all
<pb id="ward85" n="85"/>
of the white race in Europe were our friends,
especially the English, the French, and the Germans;
and I felt justified in calling attention to my own
position, as an example of improved feeling, and as a
sign of hope and a token of encouragement.
Accustomed to be soothed, as are my people, by
hopeful, encouraging truth, I never knew these
appeals to fail of effect. In addition to the above, I
urged that, as Christ forgave, so should we; and that
he made our being forgiven depend upon whether we
forgave our enemies; that just as surely as the whites
were our enemies—a most palpable fact, of every-day
illustration—just so surely we must forgive them, or lie
down for ever with them, amid the torments of the
same perdition! What an aggravation of our temporal
torments, to be obliged to be associated with our
injurers, and to be partakers with them in an
unrepented, unsanctified, more fiendish state, in the
pangs of an endless perdition!</p>
            <p>I beg to state, that I never taught on this subject
what I did not then, and do not now, believe. I
seriously believe that the prejudice of the whites
against Negroes is a constant source of temptation to
the latter to hate the former. I also believe that that
same prejudice will aggravate the perdition of both:
and I pray, therefore, that my people may be saved
from that hatred, and made forgiving; and for the
whites of America, my
<pb id="ward86" n="86"/>
highest wish is that they may all become like the
people of South Butler, thus removing danger from
themselves, and, by doing justly, remove the most
insidious of temptations from my people, whom, God
knows, they have injured enough already.</p>
            <p>In pleading the cause of the blacks before the
whites, while I tried faithfully to depict the suffering
of the enslaved, and the injustice done to the
nominally free, I never stooped to ask pity for either.
Wronged, outraged, “scattered, peeled, killed all the
day long,” as they are, I never so compromised my
own self-respect, nor ever consented to so deep a
degradation of my people, as to condescend to ask
pity for them at the hands of their oppressors. I cast
no reflections upon, and certainly utter no censures
against, those who do; but I never did, and God
forgive me when I ever shall. Justice, “even-handed
justice,” for the Negro—that which, according to
American profession, is every man's birthright—<hi rend="italics">that</hi> I claimed, nothing less. The most savage of our
tormentors could now and then shed a tear, or at least
heave a sigh of pity, and go out and remain the same
savage tormentor still; unchanged, only a little—a very
little—softened, to harden again upon the earliest
opportunity. Those who have done us the worst
injuries think it a virtue to express sympathy with 
us—a sort of arms'-length, cold-blooded sympathy;
<pb id="ward87" n="87"/>
while neither of these would, on any account,
consent to do towards us the commonest justice.
What the Negro needs is, what belongs to him—what
has been ruthlessly torn from him—and what is, by
consent of a despotic democracy and a Christless
religion, withholden from him, guiltily, perseveringly.
When he shall have that restored, he can acquire <hi rend="italics">pity</hi>
enough, and all the sympathy he needs, cheap wares
as they are; but to ask for them instead of his rights
was never my calling.</p>
            <p>Nor could I degrade myself by arguing the equality
of the Negro with the white; my private opinion is,
that to say the Negro is equal morally to the white
man, is to say but very little. As to his intellectual
equality, Cyprian, Augustine, Tertullian, Euclid, and
Terence, would pass for specimens of the <hi rend="italics">ancient</hi>
Negro, exhibiting intellect beyond the ordinary range
of modern literati, before the present Anglo-Saxon
race had even an origin. And the schoolmate of Henry
Highland Garnett, Alexander Crummell, Thomas
Sipkins Sidney, Charles Lewis Reason, Patrick Henry
Reason; the friend and associate of Frederic
Douglass, James William Charles Pennington, Amos
G. Beeman, James McCune Smith, Madison M. Clarke,
and others of like high and distinguished attainments,
might, perhaps, be deemed excusable, if he simply
called the names of these gentlemen
<pb id="ward88" n="88"/>
as sufficient to contradict any disparaging words
concerning the <hi rend="italics">modern</hi> Negro.</p>
            <p>But the cool impudence, and dastardly cowardice,
of denying a black a seat in most of their colleges and
academies, and literary and scientific institutions, from
one end of the republic to the other; and, in like
manner, shutting him out of most of the honourable
and lucrative trades and professions, dooming him to
be a mere “hewer of wood and drawer of water”—
discouraging every effort he makes to elevate himself—
and then declaring the Negro to be naturally, morally,
intellectually, or socially, inferior to the white—have
neither parallel nor existence outside of that head-quarters 
of injustice to the Negro, the United States of
America.</p>
            <p>The coloured people of New York, Philadelphia,
Boston—and, I may as well add, all other cities and
towns in the American Union—bear themselves as
respectably, support themselves as comfortably,
maintain as good and true allegiance to the laws,
make as rapid improvement in all that signifies real,
moral, social progress, as any class of citizens
whatever. They do not so rapidly acquire wealth, but
it must be remembered that the avenues to wealth are
not open to them. The French of Lower Canada—the
Irish, the Welsh, the Jews, throughout continental
Europe—the Poles—no people in a state of entire or
partial subjection—
<pb id="ward89" n="89"/>
ever bore subjection so well, or improved so rapidly in
spite of it, as this very much abused class. During the
past thirty years, they have furnished their full quota
of doctors, lawyers, divines, editors, orators, and
poets; these in their spheres compare most
triumphantly with their countrymen, of whatever
colour. With facts of this sort before me, how could I
ask pity, sympathy, reason about equality, or
anything short of justice, for my own people?</p>
            <p>There are a few facts connected with the free
coloured people of America, to which I may as well
ask attention here as elsewhere, for they are facts
gathered during the time I had the honour of being
one of their public advocates.</p>
            <p>1. They number, according to the last census, some
400,000. A majority of these live in the Slave States;
the greatest number is in Maryland, where there are
70,000. They are most numerous where most
oppressed, though this has nothing to do with their
oppression; for instance, in the great State of New
York there are 40,000, in Pennsylvania 50,000, in
Virginia 52,000. These are very large (in fact, the three
largest) States: while in New England—where, with the
exception of despotic Connecticut, they enjoy the
same political rights as white men—there are but 20,000.
The explanation of this is, no Negroes originally came
to America otherwise than as slaves. All who are
<pb id="ward90" n="90"/>
now free are the descendants of slaves, therefore;
and although slavery, in early times, existed in most of
the Northern States, it was never made a permanent
system in the New England States, and hence there
never were but comparatively few Negroes introduced
into them. In the Middle States, as New York,
Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, slavery was far more
prevalent than in any part of New England; hence
their greater number of Negroes. It may be said, too,
that this population, as a rule, bears certain
proportions to the white population; being most
numerous where the latter are so, and <hi rend="italics">vice versâ.</hi>
Besides, those States which border upon Slave States
have received accessions to their black population
from the adjoining Slave States, by the immigration of
both freemen and fugitives.</p>
            <p>2. The fact that the blacks bear generally good characters,
and are making progress as rapidly as any
other class—and, all things considered, more rapidly
than any other class—is well known to their bitterest
enemies, even to those who are most eager to
disparage them. I know this remark is not very
complimentary to the honour and honesty of
American Negro-haters; but if their characters cannot
bear truth, it is no fault of mine. I have mentioned the
names of several distinguished coloured gentlemen: I
beg to say, they are well
<pb id="ward91" n="91"/>
known in their own country and many of them,
personally, to defamers who in this country as well as
at home, speak of the Negro as hopelessly degraded,
and inferior to the whites. In the city of New York there
are several public schools for coloured children,
taught by coloured gentlemen and ladies. The
branches taught are orthography, reading, writing,
arithmetic, grammar, geography, history, astronomy,
and algebra so far as quadratic equations; the girls, I
believe, also learn needlework. From the branches
taught, one may judge the literary qualifications of the
teachers; in each of these schools there is a class, the
highest class, in which lads from eight to fourteen will
bear a most searching examination in any part of the
branches named, without a moment's notice. Having
the pleasure of personally knowing the gifted teachers,
and having examined the classes myself, I only speak
what I know; and yet, in no city of the Union is the
intellect of the Negro so much disparaged as in that
same city of New York, under the very shadow of
those schools! James Gorden Bennett, the miserable
Irish detractor of the Negro, publishes his vile “New
York Herald” within ten minutes' walk of two of those
schools—within two minutes' walk of one of the oldest
of them: aye, that same Bennett who in his “Herald”
says, the Negro never flourishes except in slavery!
<pb id="ward92" n="92"/>
Dr. Grant, of New York, preached the doctrine of
Negro intellectual inferiority on the same platform
with Frederic Douglass! Dr. Sleigh, another Irishman,
published a work to prove such allegations, in the city
of Philadelphia, where there are 20,000 or 30,000
blacks, a due proportion of whom are equal to any of
Dr. Sleigh's countrymen, either in America or in their
fatherland. Dr. J. McCune Smith met an American in
debate upon the question of the equality or the
inferiority of the Negro. His disputant deliberately
refused to call the Doctor a gentleman, and every time
he accidentally did so he corrected himself. Dr. Smith
showed himself superior, both as a gentleman and a
scholar, to this person, without making the least
impression upon his manners.</p>
            <p>The following anecdotes will illustrate my point.
During the lifetime of the venerable James Forten,
Esq., one of the brightest ornaments of the Negro
race, a leading Colonizationist called upon him, at his
residence, 92, Fifth Street, Philadelphia. Conversation
ran upon the news of the day, and at that point Mr.
Forten produced a newspaper in French, which he
had recently received from Hayti. Mr. F. handed the
newspaper to his visitor, who confessed he could not
read French; whereupon Mr. Forten called his
daughter, a most accomplished lady, who easily,
gracefully, translated for him.
<pb id="ward93" n="93"/>
That very man went to a Colonization meeting that
same evening, and made a speech denying the
intellectual power of the Negro to receive education! </p>
            <p>I was travelling in a railway carriage in 1839, in
company with two white persons, the one of whom
was an abolitionist, the other was not. They discussed
the anti-slavery question. The anti-abolitionist was a
merchant, a partner in a New York house, having a
branch in one of the Southern cities. His objection to
abolition was the unfitness of the Negro for freedom.
Among other things, he stated, that a short time
previous his Southern partner came up to New York on 
business, and, after finishing it, asked, slaveholder as he was, to
be shown the condition of the free coloured people of
New York. This man said he showed him the low, dirty
Negroes about Five Points—answering to Houndsditch,
Rag Fair, and Petticoat Lane, in London; to the Salt
Market Wynds, in Glasgow; the most immoral portions
of the old town of Edinburgh; and corresponding
portions in Liverpool, Dublin, and Cork. To show this
slaveholder the Five Points, and its inhabitants, as
specimens of Negro condition, character, and
habitations, in New York, was about as fair as to go to
such places as I have named, to learn English, Scotch,
or Irish character. The abolitionist asked him if he took
his friend to see
<pb id="ward94" n="94"/>
the Rev. T. S. Wright, the lamented predecessor of
Rev. Dr. Pennington, who was then living. The 
pro-slavery man professed not to hear, but my friend made
him hear, and he coolly answered, “No.” Shortly after,
Mr. Furman, the abolitionist, arrived at the place of his
destination, and left us. The merchant, finding no one
but myself near him, began to converse with me; and,
to my utter surprise, I found him intimately
acquainted, and on terms of long-standing personal
friendship, with many of the most genteel, best
educated, and most wealthy, of the coloured people of
New York State. That was the man who took a
Southern slaveholder to the lowest and most degraded
of our population, to impress him with an idea of what
we were. I am sorry to say, that ninety-nine in every
hundred of the traducers of the Negro in America,
whether Yankees born or Englishmen Yankeeized,
generally act with equal unfairness, under the
aggravation of equal intelligence. As a rule—such is my
experience and observation—they who treat and speak
of the Negro worst, are they who know him best. I
could fill this book with such instances.</p>
            <p>3. In spite of the foregoing facts, the coloured
people who are intelligent and prominent make friends
for themselves among the very best classes of
Americans; and the same is true, in its degree,
<pb id="ward95" n="95"/>
of black men in inferior positions. I have known a
black man to move into a neighbourhood where it
was difficult for him to rent a house to live in, because
of his colour; but edging his way in, and proving
himself as good a mechanic, farmer, labourer, or
artisan, as anyone else, he was sure to be patronized
and respected by the very best customers. I have 
known whites to go to hear a Negro
lecture, or preach, just for the fun of the thing: they
have come away saying the most extravagant things
in his favour. My advice to our people always was,
Do the thing you do in the best possible manner: if
you shoe a horse, do it so that no white man can
improve it; if you plough a furrow, let it be ploughed
to perfection's point; if you make a shoe, make it to
bespeak further patronage from the fortunate wearer
of it; if you shave a man, impress him with the idea that <hi rend="italics">such</hi>
shaving is a rare luxury; if you do no more than black
his boots, send him out of your boot-black
shop looking towards his feet, divided in his
admiration as between the blacking and the perfection
of its application. As one of our own poets hath it,
<q direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“Honour and fame from no distinction rise:</l><l>Act well your part—<hi rend="italics">there</hi> all the honour lies.”</l></lg></q>
I am happy to say, such is the good sense and honourable
manly ambition of my people, that
<pb id="ward96" n="96"/>
such advice was always approved and followed:
indeed, it was seldom needed.</p>
            <p>Mr. Douglass, as an orator, is winning for himself
and his people not only fame, but, what is far better,
the power of great and varied usefulness. Among his
most honest admirers are persons in the highest walks
of life: distinguished alike for their high positions, and
their entire fitness for them. At the risk of seeming
immodest, I may say, that my own short career
engaged for me the personal friendship of persons
who have no superiors; and whose friendship was the
more highly prized, as it was the result of my own
efforts—the acknowledgment of an equality previously
denied to the Negro, on their part—and a favourable
sign for the future of my people. The same is true of
every prominent coloured man in that country.</p>
            <p>4. The coloured people in the United States are in
no hopeless circumstances. It has already ceased to
be a marvel, that a coloured man can do certain things
denied to be within his power thirty years ago. A
State or a National Convention of black men is held.
The talent displayed, the order maintained, the
demeanour of the delegates, all impress themselves
upon the community. All agree, that to keep a people
rooted to the soil, who are rapidly improving, who
have already attained considerable influence, and are
<pb id="ward97" n="97"/>
marshalled by gifted leaders (men who show
themselves qualified for legislative and judicial
positions), and to doom them to a state of perpetual
vassalage, is altogether out of the question. They
cannot be turned back, they cannot be kept
stationary; they must and they will advance. Then, it
is well known that social progress is made with
gigantic strides, when once a movement is made in a
right direction. That impulse, a mighty impetus, has
been given; and already signs of vigorous and
hopeful advance have been developed as the result.
Then look at the materials which the blacks have at
command. They have the world's history before them.
They are <hi rend="italics">Americans;</hi> they are well taught in the
history of their native country; they know the avenues
to, and springs of, the most important and
characteristic feelings of the American heart. They
know what to say, to whom to say it, and at what time.
They are wronged: their wrongs are violations of
American profession, and what they know ought to be
American principle. They are connected socially, by
choice and by force, with the subjects of the most
cruel oppression on the face of the earth. The more
highly they are cultivated, the more keenly they feel
their wrongs. And I add, with perfect deliberation, and
with philosophical objects before me, only they are of
mixed blood; and that
<pb id="ward98" n="98"/>
fact, with the others, makes them at this day, to say
nothing of the future, confessedly the most eloquent,
the most impassioned, the most powerful, the most
impressive, and, when once heard, the most popular,
men in the anti-slavery field of labour. This was true
many years ago: every year increases its illustrations;
until now, no man is so eagerly, so tearfully, so
rapturously, listened to in America, on this subject, as
the coloured man. Already has the anti-slavery
advocacy, for all effective purposes, passed into their
hands: and America now stands in the position of a
great country, nominally free, depriving one sixth of
her citizens of freedom, and robbing those not
actually enslaved of an equality which God has given
to all nations of men, denying them even the title to it
and fitness for it; while these <hi rend="italics">coloured men,</hi> armed
with the panoply of American birth, feelings, and
history—gifted with talents surpassed by none—burning
with an indignant sense of their own wrongs, and the
enslavement of their brethren—highly skilled in the use
of their powers and talents, and having gained the
ears of their fellow citizens—are demonstrating the
injustice of the position which they occupy, and the
arrogant hypocrisy of that of their enemies.</p>
            <p>Now, when it is considered that (with perhaps the
exception of the Welsh) the Negroes are, in
<pb id="ward99" n="99"/>
feeling, the most <hi rend="italics">religious</hi> people in the world, and
that in all they do they are guided, restrained, but
made the more ardent, by the religious passion within
them, you cannot imagine that this people will or <hi rend="italics">can</hi>
eventually fail in either recovering their rights, or
attracting the thunderbolts of divine vengeance upon
their oppressors. What says all past history, upon this
subject? When did God cease to hear the cry of the oppressed?
What, in history, is the final result of the upward
struggles of an oppressed but advancing, praying,
God-fearing people? But, to do as our American
brethren like to do—leave out all considerations of
divine interpositions, or to calculate upon indefinite
forbearance of Deity—neither of which is admissible—
any one can tell that, left to themselves,
these causes must produce one or two important
results. The young blacks of the Republic are
everywhere acquiring a love for martial pastimes.
Their independent companies of military are 
becoming common in many of the large towns. This,
with other things, shows that they aspire to 
anything and everything within the reach of man. And as
their fathers fought bravely in the former wars of the
Republic, who can deny them the use of arms? Having
almost everything to contend for, it is easy to see,
that what wrongs they and their brethren suffer will
so stimulate them as to
<pb id="ward100" n="100"/>
draw out energies which not only would not be 
exhibited, in other circumstances, but which even
themselves would scarcely believe to be theirs. The
whites have all they want, and are satisfied. They are
already most rapidly degenerating: they are given
almost solely to the acquisition of money and the
pursuit of pleasure. They will therefore become less
and less active, more and more lethargic, while in their
very midst the blacks will become less lethargic, and
more energetic; until the latter, for all practical
purposes, will exhibit, and wield too, more of the real
American character, its manliness, its enterprise, its
love of liberty, than the former. I speak not as a
prophet: I only speak of causes now existing and in
active operation, already producing some of their
inevitable results. I illustrate my idea by a fact. In 1849
I introduced a young lady into my family, intending
that she should teach my children, for which she was
then qualified, being older and far better educated
than they. In 1851 she recited in the same class with
them; in 1853 she was the pupil of one of them, and
lagging behind the other. Thus will it be, in my
opinion, as between the blacks and the whites in
America. They are now in the relation of teacher and
taught, in the matter of liberty and progress; they will
reverse positions ere the struggle be over, unless some
sudden unforeseen changes occur.</p>
            <pb id="ward101" n="101"/>
            <p>Such are the signs of the times; nor is this the
first time such signs have been seen in similar 
circumstances. But, aside from this, that some may
regard as an extreme representation of the case, let
it be supposed that the free blacks shall go on and
progress as they have for the past forty years: if they
should do no more than simply improve themselves,
without exhibiting the lofty patriotism which now
so nobly prompts them to efforts for self-elevation,
their gradual improvement would draw toward
them the gaze, perhaps the admiration, of all the
Old World. Individuals among them would be
known in Europe, and public attention would be
directed to the class through these individuals; and
it would be altogether vain for Americans to 
attempt to disparage them, as they now do, in Europe.
William Wells Brown was a slave; so was Garnet.
Who, that saw them in Germany, France, or England, 
would believe any American who should presume to 
deny the qualities and claims of the American Negro? 
William Craft was a slave: many who have heard him 
with intense delight (as do most who hear) will feel 
that the American Negro is the most outraged of 
men—not mere animals, but <hi rend="italics">men.</hi> O my suffering, 
sighing people, there is hope for you—hope in your 
improvement, in your own powers; in the gathering,
 increasing sympathy of Europe; but, most of all, in 
the promises of the faithful God.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
            <head>TERMINUS OF LABOURS IN THE UNITED 
STATES.</head>
            <p>HAVING given a sketch of the nature and character 
of my labours in the United States, it remains
that I now speak of the events which led to their
termination. It is well known, that in defiance
of law and custom, and what seemed to some
the provisions of the constitution, the abolitionists
refused to aid in the capture of a fugitive slave;
they rendered him all manner of assistance in
effecting his escape; they would secure for him
a place of safety; they would aid him on his
way to Canada; they would legally and otherwise
protect him, if he remained among them; they
would help and encourage him in resisting his
pursuers: in fact, they would do for him just
 what they would have him do for them in an
exchange of circumstances. This was both illegal
and unchristian, in the view of the great majority of
the American people, especially the lawmakers and
the religious teachers. There was, indeed, a 
regularly organized society, distinct as an organization
<pb id="ward103" n="103"/>
from the Anti-Slavery Society, to aid fugitives; and
that society, called the <hi rend="italics">Vigilance</hi> Committee, 
at its head quarters, New York, annually published its report, held
platform meetings, &amp;c. So effective was this action, that
it became almost needless for a slave to go further
north than the Border States. In Boston, it was boasted,
a slave could not be captured. There were men who said
the same of numerous other towns: attempts to take
them often proved utter failures. Before the anti-slavery
movement, a slaveholder or a kidnapper could take any
man he pleased, where he pleased and when he
pleased. This had been done in every State but
Vermont, and any justice of the peace was quite
competent to settle for ever the grave question of a
man's right to liberty. Now, though the law was not
altered, such was the state of public feeling, generated
by the abolitionists, that a slave could escape, go into
an adjoining State, tell his story publicly, state who his
master was, where he lived, how his escape was
effected, through what places he passed, who aided
him, and all about it; and the whole community would
say to him, “Remain here; you are safe.” Doubtless
this partook somewhat of the Yankee habit of boasting;
it was a profession of freedom and a promise of
protection that needed some severe testing, to prove its
real strength: but that such was the public feeling, that
men
<pb id="ward104" n="104"/>
really and truly meant what they said, there never
was the least reason to doubt.</p>
            <p>The South became exasperated: their chattels,
among which were persons inheriting the blood and
the lineage of their masters (this strange-sounding
medley is no more incongruous than true) were
escaping from them; each carried off in his own person
from 400 to 2,000 dollars. There was no telling what
amount of property had thus been abstracted—or,
rather, stolen itself: but certain it was, that every
morning some planter found, or rather did not find,
some slave or slaves—they had fled. They were
constantly going; and what made the matter more
awkward was, when once gone, they would not return
of their own accord, or for the sake of anybody else.
The South knew that there is a clause in the Federal
Constitution, providing for the extradition of “persons
held to service or labour.” They knew that a great
majority of the people had been but too successfully
taught the false and foolish doctrine, that those
described as “persons,” meant slaves. They knew as
well, that Congress, in 1793, passed a law for the
enforcement of this clause of the constitution, with
this strange interpretation. They knew also that all the
courts held the same view. In 1842 a decision was
rendered in the Supreme Court to the same effect—<hi rend="italics">i.e.,</hi>
that “persons held to service
<pb id="ward105" n="105"/>
or labour” included slaves. The anti-slavery, or
rather the strictly legal and common-sense, 
objection to that interpretation, is, that in law slaves
are not “persons,” but “chattels”—that inasmuch
as the clause described them as “persons,” they
had no right under that clause to capture them as
“chattels.” As persons and chattels were neither
identical nor similar in law, but opposites, and as
the clause in question calls them the former, it
could not at the same time intend to describe them
as the latter. A law must not be interpreted to
<hi rend="italics">mean</hi> the <hi rend="italics">converse</hi> of what it <hi rend="italics">says!</hi></p>
            <p>But what of this? Were not the Supreme Court
judges appointed by a President and a senate always
subservient to slavery? Were not a number of the
judges themselves slaveholders? Were not those
judges who were non-slaveholders among the bitterest
and most cringing slaveocrats in the nation? and were
they not made judges in view of that fact? Could they
have been made judges without it? Then, as Congress
men (the majority of whom are lawyers), and inferior
judges, and lawyers, and almost everyone else, took
their legal opinions from the Supreme Court, what <hi rend="italics">it</hi>
held to be law <hi rend="italics">was</hi> law, of course. This the South, who
are the real rulers of the nation, very well knew; and
knowing their advantage, they followed it up, and
maintained it. They demanded that the law of 1793
should be enforced
<pb id="ward106" n="106"/>
—that this anti-slavery sentiment should be suppressed, 
and that further agitation of the question
should cease. The constitution must be understood as
they understood it; and therefore slaves escaping
<hi rend="italics">must be given up.</hi> Anti-slavery sentiment was not
suppressed, nor in any one thing were these demands
complied with. At last, adopting a twofold expedient,
which never yet failed when once faithfully and
vigorously applied—viz., threatening to walk out of the
Union, if their demands were not yielded; and appealing 
to the cupidity, fears and ambition, of leading Northern 
politicians—they received a promise that something 
should be done. Accordingly, such Northern men as 
Daniel Webster and Daniel S. Dickinson (how the name 
‘Daniel’ can be perverted!) set themselves about the 
work of seeking to persuade Northern men to yield. </p>
            <p>It should have been mentioned, that so powerful
had become the hostility to the extradition of fugitive
slaves, that, taking advantage of the Supreme Court
decision in 1842, to the effect that States need not aid
in the capture of runaway slaves, but that the <hi rend="italics">duty</hi> of
doing so rested entirely with the federal officers, some
eleven States passed solemn laws forbidding any of
their officers from aiding in this horrible business, any
of the judges from sitting upon such cases;
forbidding the use of any of their jails or public
buildings for the detention of a fugitive
<pb id="ward107" n="107"/>
slave, or any of their citizens doing any of these things,
directly or indirectly. Mr. Webster, and the men of his
class, sought to persuade the people of the North to 
“conquer their prejudices” against slave-catching. He
advised them to perform “the disagreeable duty” of
playing the human bloodhound. “Any one,” he said,
“could perform an agreeable duty.” The demands of the
South, the practical <hi rend="italics">masters</hi> of the nation, must be
complied with. So in 1850 a law was passed, called the
Fugitive Slave Law, providing most minutely, most
perfectly, for the catching and the delivery of fugitives,
by processes the loosest, the most summary, most
contrary to all the old law standards and maxims of the
last five centuries. Its provisions abolished the
inviolability of a man's house, person, and papers—the
right to life, liberty, and property, without due process
of law—the right of being confronted with one's
accusers—the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi>—the necessity of a
particular description of the place to be searched and
the person to be seized—the right of trial by jury, and the
right of appeal: each of which is solemnly and emphatically 
guaranteed by the constitution. It was most despotic law, 
passed by despots and their tools, for the most despotic 
of purposes—the replunging of an  American citizen, 
who had escaped therefrom, into the hell of American 
slavery; and the prohibition
<pb id="ward108" n="108"/>
of American freemen from doing aught to aid a
flying brother man, threatened with re-enslavement!</p>
            <p>In the Senate, when this Act passed, there were as
many Northern as Southern senators: in the House of
Representatives there was a clear decided majority of 
Northern representatives. This law of barbarism was
passed, therefore, by Northern men. It was taken to the
President, for his signature. He too was a Northern
man—Millard Fillmore, of New York. He had the right to
veto it. He was sworn conservator of the constitution.
It violated more principles, provisions, and express
clauses, of the constitution, than any law ever framed
since the constitution was adopted; it was, in fact, a
revolutionary, a treasonable measure. No one knew
this better than Millard Fillmore. But, pshaw! <hi rend="italics">the
South must be served.</hi> M. Fillmore owed his elevation
to them; they, not the constitution, must be looked
after; and, with eager “hot and hurried haste,” he
signed it, on the eighteenth day of September, lacking
but one day of six hundred and twenty-four years and
three months from the signing of Magna Charta—and it
became a law. Now, if a fugitive go to New York, he 
may be followed and brought back. If any man
“harbour or conceal him, or aid and abet in his escape,
or hinder or obstruct the claimant, or rescue him or
attempt to
<pb id="ward109" n="109"/>
rescue him,” it shall cost him a thousand dollars; if he
does all four of these, four times as much. Nor is this
all: “for either of said offences he shall be imprisoned
a term not exceeding six months.” Nor is this all: after
suffering and paying the above, he shall also “forfeit
and pay a sum not exceeding one thousand dollars, to
be collected in an action of debt.”—(<hi rend="italics">Section</hi> VII.)</p>
            <p>Five thousand dollars—in that dollar-loving
country—and two years' imprisonment, for what one
might do in behalf of one poor fugitive! My mother
was then living, and a fugitive. Gladly should I have
done all four of these prohibited things, in her dear
behalf.</p>
            <p>But the passing of this law, striking a fell blow as it
did at white men's liberties, as well as black men's, was
not the worst of it. Though strong and high
indignation had been expressed against the law—
though the impossibility of enforcing it was insisted
on and declared by numerous meetings in almost
every part of the country—yet, at the bidding of the
slave power, through the Northern politicians, the law
was enforced: victim after victim was yielded up on
the altar of this bloody Moloch. It is done until this
very day.</p>
            <p>Still, this was not the worst. The most popular
pulpits of the North, of Puritan New England, even
rang with preachments favouring it, and urging the
<pb id="ward110" n="110"/>
people to obey it, and advising Negroes to submit to
it. One doctor of divinity<ref targOrder="U" id="ref1" n="1" rend="sc" target="note1">*</ref>
<note id="note1" n="1" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref1"><p>* Rev. O. Dewey, D.D. The Rev. Dr. Spring says, “a
mans running away from slavery is <hi rend="italics">primá facie</hi>
evidence of his being a bad man.”</p></note> said he would give up his
own mother, rather than disobey the law, and
endanger the Union. He now says, he said his
brother. Pity that any woman ever bore such a son—
that she should have given birth to two, and one be
such a Cain!</p>
            <p>I am come to the darkest page in my native
country's history: I am chronicling her deepest
degradation. But so it is: it stands out there, in bold
relief, a part of her history. Whether she can ever be
recovered from this deep, foul, <hi rend="italics">chosen</hi> disgrace, or
not, is beyond my humble ken. But that darkness was
relieved by some most merciful tokens. In this time of
yielding principle, forswearing faith, and succumbing
to the slave power, which did more than anything ever
before to debauch American morals and blacken
American character—in this time when priest and
Levite walked on the other side, neglecting the poor
wounded man by the wayside—while these classes
were horrifying all Europe, and drawing maledictions
upon their country from all honest hearts—there stood a
host of faithful men and women, prepared for the trial
and enduring it; ready for the
<pb id="ward111" n="111"/>
sacrifice, and making it. Having put their hands to the
plough, they could not turn back. They loved the
slave, the fugitive, the suffering black, and their 
Heaven-derived anti-slavery principles, more than 
money, office, caste, or honours; and now that “the 
furnace was heated seven times hotter than it was 
wont to be heated,” they were blessed with
the grace of constancy to refuse, even more resolutely
than before, to bow before the golden image to which
the great majority paid obeisance. If trials do not make
men, they <hi rend="italics">may</hi><sic corr="develop">develope</sic> what they are; and, what is
more, they will prove who can endure the stern
demands of principle, in the hour of suffering. And,
blessed be the God of the poor! not a few were there, in
that day, in my native country, in the senate chamber,
the hall of representatives, on the judicial bench, the
ministerial office, the pulpit, and in private walks, who,
having counted the cost, were not only unflinching,
unwavering, but “waxed valiant <hi rend="italics">in</hi> the fight.” John
Parker Hale, William H. Seward, and Salmon P. Chase,
were in the Senate; Joshua R. Giddings, George W.
Julian, and a few others, were in the House of
Representatives; and so long as time shall last, so long
shall the brave minority opposition given by these
gentlemen to this infamous measure be remembered
with delight and gratitude. These persons have not
been without
<pb id="ward112" n="112"/>
their successors. Charles Sumner—the learned, classic,
elegant, manly, heroic Charles Sumner (whom Lord
Elgin told me he regards as a personal friend, because
of his anti-slavery principles, as well as high character
and shining talents)—has since adorned that Senate; so
has Henry Wilson, the self-made (another name for
God-made) champion of freedom; and Gerrit Smith,
Channey L. Knapp, and others in the House, enough
to keep the voice of manly remonstrance ever
sounding in the ears of the guilty nation.</p>
            <p>While, too, the religion of the country had become,
if possible, more corrupt than even its politics—while
its reverend doctors of divinity, venerable in years
and in learning, were counselling obedience to this
satanic law (many of whom, by the way, would like to
pass, and, unfortunately, with too much complacency
and too little scrutiny, <hi rend="italics">do</hi> pass, as acceptable 
anti-slavery men in England)—there were, in a few scattered
pulpits from one end of the land to the other, as if God
would have the leaven well diffused, some who
ceased not day nor night, in good or evil report, to lift
up their voices against these crying
abominations—slavery, the Fugitive Slave Law; the
yielding of the press, the legislature, the courts, and
the pulpit, to these demands against God and man.
They were for “obeying God rather than man.” They
<pb id="ward113" n="113"/>
had learned that such obedience, even in a free
Christian country, might cost something: they were
prepared for the cost, even though they should be
called upon
<q direct="unspecified"><lg><l>“To weary torturers, and to rejoice in fire.”</l></lg></q></p>
            <p>This brilliant galaxy of God-fearing men, shining as
stars of the first magnitude in the moral firmament of
the country, and shining all the brighter, with a light all
the more welcome, in contrast with the surrounding
blackness, included some honoured names which, to
be associated with, is akin to the associations of
patriarchs, apostles, and martyrs. Honoured of God,
they shall be honoured of men, while virtuous
constancy, unpurchasable integrity, and heroic
devotion to principle and truth, shall be admired of
mortals or angels. My pen leaps to name some of
them: I cannot mention all. To name some, and omit
others, were invidious in any man, but especially
ungracious in so humble a coadjutor—follower and
admirer, rather—of them, as myself. I will, however,
name one; one whom all the others delight to honour,
the chief though not the oldest of his family, a
standing living rebuke to the men of his class and 
profession, but honour to <hi rend="italics">the profession itself</hi>—
the bold, the honest, the self-sacrificing, the amiable, 
Henry Ward Beecher.</p>
            <p>As an humble advocate of anti-slavery principles,
<pb id="ward114" n="114"/>
it was my duty, under the guidance of the
great chiefs of the cause, to adapt myself to those
forms and phases of slavery's progress and demands
which arose from time to time to public view—to drag
out to the light secret plots and mischievous though
hidden machinations of the slave power—to preach the
gospel of deliverance to the captives—and to aid,
counsel and encourage, my own, the black people, in
what was needed in their peculiar circumstances.
Thus, when the annexation of Texas was on the <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fre">tapis,</foreign></hi> that must be exposed and denounced; when the
war with Mexico was conceived and brought forth, on
purpose to lengthen the cords and strengthen the
stakes of slavery, that must be made a prominent
topic; when the admission of new Slave States, as
Florida and Texas, was sought, opposition to <hi rend="italics">that</hi> was
the duty of the day; when, as in New York State, in
1846, it was proposed to continue the odious clause of
State constitution by which black men were disallowed
to vote on terms of equality with whites, the iniquity
of that proposition must be holden up; when it was
the intention of slaveocratic politicians to give slavery
“aid and comfort” by electing to the Presidential chair
some such arrant slaveholder as Henry Clay, or some
such convenient, subservient instrument of slavery as
Millard Fillmore, and to seduce abolitionists into
voting for them, facts in
<pb id="ward115" n="115"/>
the long, dark, pro-slavery and slaveholding history
of these men must be “kept before the people”; when
the Methodist, the Episcopalian, the Presbyterian or
the Baptist Church, or some of their benevolent
organizations, did as they never failed to do, annually
deliver themselves of some additional pro-slavery
religious progeny, the testimony God's Word
must be uttered against these; and when the Fugitive
Slave Law began to cast the darkness of its shadow
upon us, threatening its coming self, the country must
be warned against this; and finally, when it had
passed, the twofold duty of putting on record, upon
the roll of infamy, for the gaze of an indignant
posterity, the names of the conspirators against liberty
who passed it, signed it, enforced it, and executed it,
and those worst of all others, who gave it pulpit
sanction; and of giving it our <hi rend="italics">heartiest</hi> opposition, at
all hazards and under all circumstances—must be
performed. To what effect, if any, I performed my
humble share in this work, it is not for me to say: that I
laboured honestly and with good purpose, I trust few
will deny who honour me with their acquaintance.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 1851, business called me to travel
in various parts of the country. I visited numerous
districts of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, 
Michigan, and Indiana,
<pb id="ward116" n="116"/>
as well as Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, 
and New Hampshire. Smarting as we were
under the recently passed Fugitive Law—and
irritations being inflamed and aggravated by the
dragging of some poor victim of it from some
Northern town to the South and to slavery, every
month or so—of course this law became <hi rend="italics">the theme</hi>
of most I said and wrote. In October, Mrs. Ward
accompanied me in a tour through Ohio. We were
about finishing that tour, when we saw in the
papers an account of the Gorsuch case, in Christiana, 
Pennsylvania. That was a case in which
the Reverend Mr. Gorsuch went armed to the
house of a Negro, in the suburbs of the town
named, in search of a slave who had escaped from
him. The owner of the house denied him admittance. 
Several Negroes, armed, stood ready inside
the house to defend it against the <hi rend="italics">reverend</hi> slave-catcher 
and his party—the latter declaring his
slave was in that house, avowing his determination to 
have him, if he went to h—ll after him;
and, intending to intimidate the Negroes, fired
upon the house with a rifle. Fortunately none of
the besieged party were killed; but, they returned
Mr. Gorsuch's fire, and <hi rend="italics">he</hi> dropped a corpse!</p>
            <p>The authorities arraigned these poor Negroes for
murder. They seemed determined to have their blood.
Upon reading this, I handed the paper
<pb id="ward117" n="117"/>
containing the account to my wife; and we concluded
that resistance was fruitless, that the country was
hopelessly given to the execution of this barbarous
enactment, and that it were vain to hope for the
reformation of such a country. At the same time, my
secular prospects became exceedingly involved and
embarrassed; and willing as I might be to be one of 
a forlorn hope in the assault upon slavery's citadel, I 
had no reasonable prospect of doing so, consistently 
with my duty to my family. The anti-slavery cause does 
not, cannot, find bread and education for one's children. 
We then jointly determined to wind up our affairs, and 
go to Canada; and, with the remnant of what might be 
left to us, purchase a little hut and garden, and pass the
remainder of our days in peace, in a free British
country.</p>
            <p>Such was our conclusion on Monday, the 29th of
September, 1851. Residing then at Syracuse, we went
home, arriving on Wednesday, the first day of
October. We found the whole town in commotion and
excitement. We soon learned the cause. A poor
Mulatto man, named Jerry, at the suit of his own
father had been arrested under the Fugitive Law, had
been before the Negro-catcher's court, had escaped,
had been pursued and retaken, and was now being
conveyed to prison. I went to the prison, and, in 
company with that true sterling
<pb id="ward118" n="118"/>
friend of the slave, the Reverend Samuel J. May, was
permitted to go in and see the man. He had fetters on
his ankles, and manacles on his wrists. I had never
before, since my recollection, seen a chained slave. He
was a short, thick-set, strongly built man, half white
though slave born. His temperament was ardent, and
he was most wonderfully excited. Though chained, he
could not stand still; and in that narrow room,
motioning as well as he could with his chained,
manacled hands, and pacing up and down as well as
his fetters would allow, fevered and almost frenzied
with excitement, he implored us who were looking on,
in such strains of fervid eloquence as I never heard
before nor since from the lips of man, to break his
chains, and give him that liberty which the Declaration
of Independence assumed to be the birthright of every
man, and which, according to the law of love, was our
duty towards a suffering brother.</p>
            <p>I cannot recall the <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">ipsissima verba</foreign></hi> of his eloquent
pleading. As far as I can revive his sentences in my
memory, he exclaimed—“Gentlemen, behold me, and
these chains! Why am I bound thus, in a free
country? Am I not a man like yourselves? Do you not
suppose I feel as other men feel? Oh, gentlemen, what
have I done to deserve this cruel treatment? I was at
my work, like an honest industrious man. I was trying
to act the part of a
<pb id="ward119" n="119"/>
good citizen; but they came upon me, and accused
me of crime. I knew I was innocent; but I felt it my duty
to go before the court, to declare and to prove my
innocence. For that reason I let that little Marshal, I
think you call him, put handcuffs on me. You know,
gentlemen, handcuffs don't hurt an innocent man! But
after they put the irons on me, they told me they were
taking me as a runaway slave! Didn't I tell you I was 
innocent? They confessed I was. If I had known what
they were about, do you think I should have <hi rend="italics">let that
little ordinary man put irons on me?</hi> No, indeed! I have
told you how deceitfully they took me. When I saw a
good chance, I thought it was not wrong to break away
from them. I watched my opportunity: I dashed out of
the door; I ran like a man running for his freedom; but
they overtook me, and brought me back, and here I am
like a wild beast, chained and caged.</p>
            <p>“Gentlemen, is this a free country? Why did my
fathers fight the British, if one of their poor
sons is to be treated in this way? I beseech you,
gentlemen, as you love your own liberty, break these
chains of mine; yes, and break the chains that bind
my brethren in the South, too. Does not the Bible say,
‘Break every yoke, and let the oppressed go free’?
Don't you believe the Bible? I can't read it as some of 
you can, but I believe
<pb id="ward120" n="120"/>
what it says, and I ask you, gentlemen, to do for me
what that book commands. Suppose that any one of
you were in my position. What would you wish me to
do? I beg of you, gentlemen, to do for me what you
would wish, were you where I am. Are not all men born
free and equal? How is it, then, that I must wear these
chains? Give me, O give me, gentlemen, that freedom
which you say belongs to all men, and it is all I ask.
Will you who are fathers, and brothers, see a man dragged 
in chains to the slavery of Tennessee, which I know
is worse than death itself? In the name of our common
nature—in the name of the Declaration of Independence
—in the name of that law in the Bible which says, “do
as you would be done by”—in the name of God, our
common Father—do break these chains, and give me the
freedom which is mine because I am a man, and an
American.”</p>
            <p>What a sight! and what sounds! A slave, in a free
Northern city chained as no felon would be chained,
with the blood of Anglo-Saxons in his veins. Still, a
slave; the son of a wealthy planter in Tennessee, and
still a slave; arrested by a United States officer and
several assistants, who were sworn to support the
glorious Federal Constitution, serving under the freest
government under the sun, the land of liberty, the
refuge for the oppressed of all the world! And for
what was
<pb id="ward121" n="121"/>
he arrested? What was his crime? A love of that
liberty which we all declared to be every man's
inalienable right! And this slave was quoting the
Declaration of Independence in chains! He was not
the subject of some Czar, some,
<q direct="unspecified"><lg><l>“Turbaned Turk or fiery Russ:”</l></lg></q>
no, he was an American by birth, and a slave as well;
so said the chains upon him: and on his lips were
liberty's and religion's great watchwords! I never saw
extremes so meet. I never saw how hollow a mockery
was our talk about liberty, and our professions of
Christianity. I never felt how really we were all subject
to the slave power; I never felt before the depth of
degradation there is in being a professed freeman of the
Northern States. Daniel Webster had, a few months
before, predicted the execution of the Fugitive Law in
that very town. The people laughed him to scorn. We
now felt, however, how much better he knew the depths
to which Northern men can sink than we did. While
these thoughts were galloping through our brains, this
manacled son of a white man proceeded with his oration
in his chains, and we felt dumb and powerless. A great
crowd gathered about the door; and after looking on
and drinking in as much of the scene as my excitable
nature would allow, I turned to go away, and at that
moment the crowd demanded
<pb id="ward122" n="122"/>
a speech of me. I spoke. I ceased; but I
I never felt the littleness of my always little
speeches, as I did at that moment. Jerry had
made <hi rend="italics">the</hi> speech of the occasion, and all I could
say was but tame and spiritless in comparison
with his
<q direct="unspecified"><lg><l>“Words that breathed and thoughts that burned.”</l></lg></q></p>
            <p>The substance of what I said is as follows:—
“Fellow citizens! we are here in most extraordinary
circumstances. We are witnessing such a sight as, I
pray, we may never look upon again. A man in
chains, in Syracuse! Not a felon, yet in chains! On
trial, is this man, not for life, but for liberty. He is
arrested and held under a law made by ‘Us the 
People’—pursuant, we pretend, to a clause in 
the constitution. That constitution was made ‘to 
secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves
and our posterity.’ Here is a man one of ‘ourselves’; 
and the colour he bears shows that he belongs not 
altogether to my race, but that he is one of the 
‘posterity’ of those who framed and adopted our 
Federal constitution. So far are we from ‘securing’ to 
him the ‘blessings of liberty,’ that we have arrested him, 
confined him, and chained him, on purpose to inflict 
upon him the curses of slavery.</p>
            <p>“They say he is a slave. What a term to apply to
an American! How does this sound beneath
<pb id="ward123" n="123"/>
the pole of liberty and the flag of freedom? What a
contradiction to our ‘Declaration of Independence’!
But suppose he be a slave: is New York the State to
recognize and treat him as such? Is Syracuse the city
of the Empire State in which the deeds which make
this a day unfortunately memorable, should be
perpetuated? If he be not a slave, then, he is the most
outraged man we ever saw.</p>
            <p>“What did our fathers gain by the seven years'
struggle with Great Britain, if, in what are called Free
States, we have our fellow citizens, our useful
mechanics and skilful artisans, chained and enslaved? 
How do foreign nations regard us, when knowing
that it is not yet three short months since we were
celebrating the Declaration of Independence, and 
to-day we are giving the most palpable denial to 
every word therein declared?</p>
            <p>“But I am told that this is a legal transaction.
That it is wrong and unwise to speak against a
judicial proceeding, not yet completed: I admit it
all. I make no pretensions to speak wisely. I
have heard a speech from Jerry. I feel for him,
as for a brother; and under that feeling, I may
not speak quite so soberly as I ought. ‘Oppression 
maketh a wise man mad.’ I feel oppressed in
a twofold sense. Yonder is my brother, in chains.
Those chains press upon my limbs. I feel his
<pb id="ward124" n="124"/>
sufferings, and participate his anguish. I feel, and we
may all feel, oppressed in another sense. Here are
certainly five-and-twenty hundred of us, wild with
excitement in behalf of our chained brother, before
our eyes, and we are utterly powerless to
help him! We hear his strong, thrilling appeals, until
our hearts sicken and our heads ache; but there is
none among us that has the legal power to lift a hand
in his defence, or for his deliverance. Of what
advantage is it that we are free? What value is there
in our freedom, while our hands are thus tied?</p>
            <p>“Fellow citizens, whatever may be the result of
these proceedings—whether our brother leaves the
court, a declared freeman or a chained slave—upon us,
the voters of New York State, to a very great extent,
rests the responsibility of this Fugitive Slave Law. It is
for us to say whether this enactment shall continue to
stain our statute books, or be swept away into merited
oblivion. It is for us to say whether the men who made
it, and those who execute it before our faces, shall
receive our votes, or shall by those votes be
indignantly rebuked. Tell me, ye sturdy working men of
Onondago, shall your votes be consecrated to the
latter, or prostituted to the former? Do you swear
fealty to freedom this day? Do you promise, so help
you God! so to vote, as that your sanction never
<pb id="ward125" n="125"/>
more shall be given to laws which empower persons to 
hunt, chain, and cage, MEN, in our midst?
(cries of ‘yes, yes.’) Thank you, fellow citizens,
in the name of our brother in prison! thank you
for your bold, manly promise! May we all abide
by it, until deeds of darkness like the one we now
lament shall no longer mar our institutions and
blacken our history.”</p>
            <p>But the crowd felt rightly. They saw Gerrit Smith 
and me go off arm in arm to hold a consultation, and,
two and two, they followed us. Glorious mob! unlike
that of 1834, they felt for the poor slave, and they
wished his freedom. Accordingly, at nine o'clock that
evening, while the court was in session trying Jerry
for more than his life, for his liberty, the mob without
threw stones into the window, one of which came so
near to the judge that, in undignified haste, he
suddenly rose and adjourned the courts. In an hour
from that time, the mob, through certain stalwart
fellows whom the Government have never had the
pleasure of catching, broke open the door and the
side of the building where Jerry was, put out the
lights, took him out in triumph, and bore him away
where the slave-catchers never after saw him.</p>
            <p>The Marshal of the United States, who had him in
custody, was so frightened that he fled in female
attire: brave man! According to the Fugitive Law,
<pb id="ward126" n="126"/>
he had to pay Jerry's master one thousand dollars;
for so the law expressly ordains.</p>
            <p>An assistant Marshal, who was aiding this one,
fired a pistol when <hi rend="italics">entrée</hi> was first made. He injured
no one, but a stout stick struck his arm and broke it.
Escaping out of a window soon after, he broke the
same arm again, poor man! These two were not like a
Marshal in Troy, in the same State, who, rather than
capture a slave, resigned his office.</p>
            <p>The papers in the interest of the Government, in
publishing an account of this affair, connected my
name with it in a most prominent manner. The
Marshal with broken arm was especially commended
to my tender regard. The Government, under the
advice of Daniel Webster (whose Christianity,  I find,
is highly lauded in this country; it was always a <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">res
non</foreign></hi> in his own), ordered all the parties, directly or
indirectly engaged in the rescuing of Jerry, to be put
on trial for <hi rend="italics">treason!</hi> For it was the doctrine of Mr.
Webster and Mr. Fillmore, that opposition to the Slave
Law was “treason, and drew after it all the
consequences of treason.” I knew enough to
understand that <hi rend="italics">one</hi> of the “consequences drawn
after treason” is a <hi rend="italics">hempen rope.</hi> I had already become
hopeless of doing more in my native country; I had
already determined to go to Canada. Now, however,
<pb id="ward127" n="127"/>
matters became <hi rend="italics">urgent.</hi> I could die; but was
it duty? I could not remain in that country without 
repeating my connection with or participating
in such an affair as I was then <hi rend="italics">guilty</hi> of. If I did
my duty by my fellow men, in that country, I must go to
prison, perhaps; certainly, if the Government had their
way, to the gallows. If I did not, I must go to perdition.
Betwixt the two, my election was made. But then, what
must become of my family, both as to their bread in my
then circumstances, and as to their liberty in <hi rend="italics">such</hi> a
country? Recollecting that I had already my wife's
consent (without which I could not take any important
step of the sort) to go to Canada, I concluded that I
must go immediately. I went; and a month or two after,
my family followed: since which time we have each
and severally been, <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="ita">con amore,</foreign></hi> the most loyal and
grateful of British subjects.</p>
            <p>Jerry lived at Kingston, Canada, until the latter part
of 1853, when he died, a free man, by virtue of living in
British soil. The courts would not entertain the charge
of treason against those accused in this case, from its
manifest absurdity. They did hold, however, that they
had broken the Fugitive Law, and must be tried for
that. Luckily, but one person who was accused was
ever convicted. He died before the court, in its
mercilessness,
<pb id="ward128" n="128"/>
could wreak its full vengeance upon him. He
was innocent; I know.</p>
            <p>When the accused were summoned to Auburn,
twenty-six miles from Syracuse, to attend trial, the
Railway Company provided carriages for the accused
and their wives, <hi rend="italics">gratis.</hi> Returning from Auburn, several
of those ladies were in the large carriage into which the
Government prosecutor entered. They unanimously
requested his departure. They afterwards made up a
purse of <hi rend="italics">thirty</hi> pieces of silver, of the smallest coin of
the country, and presented to him—wages of iniquity
and treachery. The chains (which I helped to file off) of
Jerry were packed in a neat mahogany box, and sent
to President Fillmore. The Hon. W. Seward voluntarily
became bail for the accused. He has been Governor of
his native State. He is now one of its senators. This,
however, is his highest honour. So he esteems it.</p>
            <p>In conclusion I beg to say, that the passage of the
Nebraska Bill, and the outrages following it under
sanction of the Government in Kansas, but confirms
the opinion I formed four years ago, as to the
impossibility—by any means now extant, and they are
as wise as human ingenuity can invent—of reforming
that country. The Government is too
much at the mercy of 62,000 slaveholders; the people
are too well content to let things remain as
<pb id="ward129" n="129"/>
they are—the Churches, generally, cling with too great
tenacity to their time-honoured pollutions to admit of
any prospect of reformation at present, while the
gloomiest future seems to overhang the country. The
only hopeful spot in the American horizon is the
growing, advancing attitude of the black people. From
the whites, as a whole, I see no hopes. In the blacks I
see some precious vigorous germs springing from
seeds formerly sown, watered by many cries and
tears, nourished by many prayers—the seed-sowing of
Richard Allen and John Gloucester, Thomas Sipkins,
Peter Williams, George Hogarth, Samuel Todd and
William Hamilton, James Forten and Theodore
Sedgewick Wright, among the departed; of Jehiel C.
Beeman, Samuel E. Cornish, James William Charles
Pennington, Christopher Rush, William Whipper,
Timothy Eato, M. M. Clarke, Stephen Smith, and
others, among the older living; the latter of whom
have been permitted to outlive the darkness of a past
and see the light enjoyed by the present generation.</p>
            <p>God grant that right may prevail, and that all things
shall further his glory!</p>

            <head>FIRST IMPRESSIONS: REASONS FOR LABOURS.</head>
            <p>I MADE my <hi rend="italics">entrée</hi> into Canada, as a resident and a
fugitive, in October, 1851, at Montreal. I had
been to Queenstown, Windsor, and Kingston, as
well as Niagara Falls, at various times within eleven
years, as a mere visitor, then little dreaming of the
necessity of my going as a settler. After spending
a very few days at Montreal, I ascended the St.
Lawrence, to Kingston; thence by Lake Ontario
to Toronto, my present residence. It is impossible
to convey to an English reader anything like a
just idea of the St. Lawrence River scenery in
October. This is my third autumn in Europe;
but never, in the British Isles, did I witness such
splendour of landscape as that river presents, in
autumn. The river is large and majestic—near
Montreal, where the placid Ottawa empties itself, it is
most magnificent. The Ottawa, as smooth as a
polished mirror, opening its ample mouth to the width
of a lake, gently glides into the St. Lawrence; the latter
with a quiet dignity receiving the
<pb id="ward134" n="134"/>
tribute of the former, as an empress would graciously
accept the homage of a courtier, rolling downward
towards the gulf, as if created on purpose to convey
to the ocean the tributes and the trusts committed to
it, and as if amply powerful to bear both the honour
and the burden.</p>
            <p>But going upwards, while the St. Lawrence is large
and noble enough, it frequently is compressed into a
comparatively small size, and falls over cascades. The
steamers, however, are accommodated with canals,
which admit of the continuance of navigation with but
little interruption. At times, the St. Lawrence takes the
form of a wide bay, studded with tiny islets, and the
latter most densely covered with foliage—which, in
early autumn, after the first few touches of the hoar
frost, assume the most gorgeously brilliant hues. The
intensest crimson, the deepest brown, the most
glowing lemon colour, with occasional intermixtures
of the unchanging foliage of the evergreens, and some
intermediate colours, give these islets and these bays
the appearance of immense vases filled with bouquets
of unspeakable beauty and of most imposing
grandeur. Those who have seen the representation of
the brightness and charms of North American
autumnal foliage, in Mr. Friend's panorama, may feel
assured that it is not in the least exaggerated
or overdrawn. I doubt if a more delightful
<pb id="ward135" n="135"/>
autumnal voyage can  be made in North America, than 
that from Montreal to Kingston; nor do I think that any season
presents so many and so varied attractions to the
lover of the picturesque in nature, even there, as does
early autumn.</p>
            <p>The banks of the St. Lawrence are cultivated to
a considerable extent; and that cultivation both
bespeaks the industry and enterprise of the yeoman,
and the profit of living on the great watery highway to
the ocean, and near to large and populous growing
towns. Beautiful fields of early-sown wheat show
themselves at intervals all along our way;
neat, and in some cases elegant, farm houses,
in the midst of orchards or ornamental trees, and nice
rustic gardens, lent not a little to the beauty and
interest of the scenery: and before I knew it, I was
preferring the right hand—the British—side of the
St. Lawrence, and concluding that on <hi rend="italics">that</hi> side
things were most inviting, and trying to reason
myself into the belief of this with a sort of patriotic
feeling to which all my life before I had been a stranger,
and concerning which I had been a sceptic. Why
had I interest in the British side of the noble St. Lawrence?
What gave me a fellow feeling with those inhabitants? Simply
the fact, that that country had become to me, in a sense
in which no country ever was before, my own, and those 
people my fellow citizens.</p>
            <pb id="ward136" n="136"/>
            <p>After a most delightful passage of two days, I
arrived at Toronto. I then renewed acquaintance,
formerly made, with Thomas F. Cary, Esq., one of the
sincerest, most generous, practical friends I ever had
the honour to call by that endearing name. The Rev. J.
Roaf, whom I had formerly met in New York, took me
by the hand, as he is ever ready to do in the case of the
outcast. Through the kindness of this gentleman I was
introduced to the Anti-Slavery Society of Canada, of
which the Rev. Dr. Willis was and is President. Thus
Mr. Roaf laid me under a twofold obligation, which I
never can cancel, and never forget—that for his personal
kindness, and that for affording me the honour and
pleasure of the acquaintance, ripened into friendship (if
the Doctor will allow me to say so), of the Rev. Michael
Willis, D.D.</p>
            <p>By the advice of these gentlemen and their
colleagues in the Anti-Slavery Committee, I began to
lecture in Canada, and finally became the agent of the
Canadian Anti-Slavery Society. While in this service, it
was my duty to travel all over the country, giving
facts touching American slavery, seeking to awaken
an interest against slavery in Canada, asking aid and
kindness towards such fugitives as needed help,
forming auxiliary societies, seeking to show the
influence correct sentiment in Canada might have
upon the adjoining States, and
<pb id="ward137" n="137"/>
doing all that could be done, by advice,
encouragement, and any other means, to promote the
development, the progress, all the best moral and
material interests, of the coloured people. What I saw,
and how I saw it, while thus engaged, shall be the
theme of this part of this volume.</p>
            <p>At first sight, one would scarcely allow that 
anti-slavery labours were needed in a free British colony:
most persons think so. The remark was frequently
made to me, when proposing a meeting,
or when speaking of the subject. But it is to be
remembered, that Canada lies immediately next the
States of Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, New York,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan, to go no further
westward. These States produce some of the boldest
pro-slavery politicians, some of the guiltiest of
slavery's abettors, some of the most heretical of
slavery's pulpit parasites; and it is sorrowful to add,
some of the most successful in their several 
pro-slavery pursuits, that ever disgraced a free
country, or desecrated free institutions, or belied
our holy religion and its Author. Their
history is not only contemporaneous with the history of
Northern pro-slaveryism, but part and parcel of it. It is easy
to see that a large population, infected with a
sympathy for the slaveholder, upon our very border,
must either have a serious effect upon us, in corrupting
us, or we must exert a
<pb id="ward138" n="138"/>
good influence upon them, provided we be, as we
should be, thoroughly and incorruptibly and actively
anti-slavery. Unfortunately, the former is the fact, and
not the latter.</p>
            <p>Besides, there is a vast amount of intercourse
with the adjoining States, and a great deal of
traffic, and Canadians travel extensively in the
States, as do the people of the States in Canada.
Thus the spread of slaveholding predilections is both
favoured and facilitated; and, what is more, there
is abundant evidence that some Americans 
industriously use these opportunities for the purpose of
giving currency to their own notions. Moreover,
in various parts of Canada Yankees have settled,
and for miles around them the poison of their 
pro-slavery influence is felt. Some of them do not
scruple to make known their desire to see Canada
a part of the Union, and thus brought under the
control of the slave power, and made a park for
slaveholders to hunt human deer in. In the time
of the Rebellion these things were said without
concealment; and I have known cases where 
Yankees, living in Canada for fifteen years, have shown
themselves hostile to our Sovereign and our free
institutions until they-wanted office, and then, all
at once, they took the oath of allegiance!</p>
            <p>It is not to be forgotten, on the other hand, that in
the States bordering upon us are some of the
<pb id="ward139" n="139"/>
most thorough out-spoken abolitionists in the
American Union. Having had the honour of being one
of their humblest coadjutors, I could bear testimony to
their zeal and trueness; and I felt, in living so near
them, I was not entirely separated from them, though in
another country, so far as political relations were
concerned. I knew very well, and so did the society,
that co-operation and sympathy with these benevolent
men and women was an object well worthy of our
labours. Our fugitives passed through their hands.
They conducted the underground railway. The goods
were consigned to us. When they reached us they
ceased to be goods, and became men <hi lang="lat" rend="italics">instanter.</hi> For
that purpose they sent them; for that purpose we
received them. On that account they rejoiced in the
true practical freedom of our country; on that account
we deemed it a mercy to be permitted to live in such a
country. They wrought and rejoiced on one side of the
line; we did the same on the other side of the line. We
were yokefellows, why should we not recognize each other as such?
We did; we do yet. They attend our annual anti-slavery 
gatherings, we attend theirs.</p>
            <p>But I may as well come to some more unwelcome
facts, showing the need of anti-slavery labour in Canada. I
class them under two heads—1st, Pro-slavery
feeling; and, 2nd, Negro-hate.</p>
            <pb id="ward140" n="140"/>
            <p>1. I do not now speak of Yankee settlers, visitors,
or travellers: enough has been said of them. I now
speak of British-born subjects, who in Canada exhibit
these two sentiments in a manner that no Yankee can excel.
There are men and women in our midst who justify
slavery, out and out. Some of these were heretofore
planters in the West Indies. The victims of their
former power being translated by the law of 1834
into freemen, they never can forgive Lord Grey,
Lord Derby, nor the British Cabinet and the British
people, for the demanding, advocacy, and passing, of
that law. Their property, their power, their wealth in
human beings, are all gone, or nearly so. They are
almost all of them friends of slavery, or enemies of
the Negro, or both.</p>
            <p>Others were slaveholders aforetime in the United 
States. Circumstances of one sort and another have
induced them to change their residences, and they
now abide in our midst, participating in our freedom,
and seeming to enjoy it; but they cannot forget the “leeks
and the onions” of that Egypt in which they once luxuriated
as small-sized, very small, Pharaohs. They are not wont
to say a great deal about it, for that is not exactly the
latitude for the popularity of such sentiments; but
they say enough to show who and what they are. And,
“tell it not in Gath!” some of both these classes of
Canadian slaveocrats are coloured men!</p>
            <pb id="ward141" n="141"/>
            <p>Another class were poor in former days, and,
going out to seek their fortunes, alighted upon
Southern plantations, where they found lucrative
employment, in slave-driving; or they have contracted 
marriage alliances with the daughters of slaveholders,
and thus become sons-in-law and
brothers-in-law to slaveholders and to slavery.
Such self-seeking, pelf-seeking, devotees of the
institution, are always the most clamorous in its
behalf. These obey this rule with all their might.</p>
            <p>Others still—like many, too many, Englishmen
—without direct or indirect, present or past, interest
in slavery, have travelled in the South; and,
belonging to that extremely clever class of persons
who possess the extraordinary facility of going
through a country with both eyes wide open, and
seeing nothing but just what they wish to see,
return ignorant of any evils in slavery. “Fat,
sleek, well contented slaves,” were the only ones
<hi rend="italics">they</hi> saw. There were none but the kindest masters
in any part of the country through which <hi rend="italics">they</hi>
travelled. They cannot distinctly remember to
have heard of a slave auction, of the separation of
a slave family, of a case of severe flogging, of a
chained coffle gang, of murder, incest, fornication
or adultery, during all the tour: in fact, they cannot
believe that such things do occur! Slavery, in their
eyes—sightless eyes, in chosen circumstances
<pb id="ward142" n="142"/>
—is a very innocent, happy affair. True, they
never wore the yoke, they never even tasted any of
those sweets which they are sure were from <hi rend="italics">necessity</hi>
in slavery; but they know (that is, they know nothing)
and are prepared to testify (albeit their testimony is
good for nothing) that slavery is only bad, if bad at all,
either in the exaggerated view of the abolitionists, or
as the result of the exasperations of the amiable
slaveholders by the intermeddling of the abolitionists.
Yes, our sacred soil is polluted by the unholy tread of
pro-slavery men. Fortunately, but few of them, so far
as I know, are ministers of the gospel. Two bishops,
one a Roman Catholic and the other an Episcopalian,
have the name of it. I doubt if they are falsely charged;
but still I cannot say, certainly. Some, I know, are
very chary of doing anything against slavery. I know
of one, an Englishman, in Hamilton (the Yankeeist
town in Canada), who is especially cautious; and
another, a Scotchman, “canny” to the last degree, lest
he should be suspected of anti-slaveryism. And fame
says—no, it was a doctor of divinity who told me—that
there is at least <hi rend="italics">one</hi> now in Toronto, who was once in
Hamilton, who favours the pro-slavery side of the
case. But the very difficulty I have in recollecting
these few, after having travelled all over the colony,
shows that, with us, anti-slavery is
<pb id="ward143" n="143"/>
the rule, pro-slavery the exception, in our clergy-men, 
while in the States the converse is true.
That is something. But I shall not leave this
truth, so gloriously creditable to the ministry of
my adopted country, to be merely inferred from
the foregoing. I shall by and by have the great
pleasure of asserting it in direct terms, as I do now
by implication.</p>
            <p>2. Canadian Negro-haters are the very worst of
their class. I know of none so contemptible. I say this
in justice to the Americans from whom I have suffered,
in the States, and to whom I have very freely alluded;
and in justice, too, to such Yankees as are now resident in
Canada. And I beg to say, that I write no more freely than I have
spoken, to the very faces of those I am now describing.</p>
            <p>This feeling abounds most among the native
Canadians, who, as a rule, are the lowest, the least
educated, of all the white population. Like the same
class in England, and like the ancestors of the
Americans, they have not the training of gentlemen, are
not accustomed to genteel society, and, as a consequence, 
know but little, next to nothing, of what are liberal enlightened
views and genteel behaviour. Having no social standing
such as gentlemen feel the necessity of maintaining,
they suffer nothing from doing an ungentlemanly
<pb id="ward144" n="144"/>
deed; and having neither a high aim nor a high
standard of social behaviour, they seem to be, and
in fact are, quite content to remain as they are. It
is obvious, too, that such a class will maintain a
poor petty jealousy towards those coming into the
country who give any signs of prospering, especially
if they are, from colour or what not, objects of 
dislike. In saying this feeling abounds most among
native Canadians of the lower order, I do not mean
that it is confined to them; nor do I mean to say
that it is universal, without exception, even among
this class—others exhibit it, and some of that class
are among the freest from it. Still, its chief seat
is in their bosoms. A few facts will make my
meaning more clear.</p>
            <p>In many cases, a black person travelling, whatever
may be his style and however respectable his
appearance, will be denied a seat at <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fre">table d'hôte</foreign></hi> at a
country inn, or on a steamer; and in a case or two
coming under my own observation, such have been
denied any sort of entertainment whatever. A
gentleman of my acquaintance,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref2" n="2" rend="sc" target="note2">*</ref><note id="note2" n="2" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref2"><p>* Mr. Peter O'Banyon.</p></note> driving a good pair
of horses, and travelling at leisure, with his ladylike
wife, was one night, in the winter of 1851-52, denied
admittance at some dozen public taverns. His lady,
being of lighter complexion than himself, on one or
two occasions was admitted,
<pb id="ward145" n="145"/>
and was comfortably seated by the fire, and politely
treated—until her darker-skinned husband came in, and
then, there was no room for either. It was a bitterly
cold night; and being treated—maltreated—
after this manner until nearly midnight,
they were at length obliged to accept of a room in
which they could <hi rend="italics">sit up</hi> all night.</p>
            <p>In December, 1851, a black man arrived at Hamilton.
He proposed going into an omnibus, to ride up from
the wharf at which he landed, to Week's Hotel. The
servants on the omnibus declared it was full. This
being false, and it being pointed out to them, they
declared the empty seats were engaged to persons
whom they were to take up on the way. After the black
had been refused a passage in the omnibus, numbers
of whites were freely admitted—in fact, solicited to enter
it. The Negro had no means of getting up with his
luggage until a kind-hearted Irishman took him in his
waggon. Upon reaching Week's Hotel, he applied for
lodging, but was distinctly refused a bed, solely on
the ground of his colour. Such were Mr. Week's
express orders.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref3" n="3" rend="sc" target="note3">*</ref><note id="note3" n="3" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref3"><p>* The black person is the Writer.</p></note> Some six months after that, I heard of
the destruction of a large amount of Week's property
by fire, without shedding a single tear! Two cases like
these I have not known in the States for twenty years.
While
<pb id="ward146" n="146"/>
these Canadian tavern-keepers have been apeing the
bad character of their Yankee neighbours, they have
not participated in some better influences on this
subject, which the repeated droppings of the 
anti-slavery streamlet have caused to take place on the
Yankee rock of Negro-hate. In that respect Canadian is
beneath and behind Yankee feeling.</p>
            <p>The instances which have come before me of such
occurrences at taverns would be too numerous to
mention. I will give two steamboat cases, of many. A
gentleman of colour,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref4" n="4" rend="sc" target="note4">*</ref><note id="note4" n="4" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref4"><p>* Peter Galego, Esq.</p></note> who graduated at King's College
(now the university) at Toronto, was going to
Kingston. He took a first class ticket, and was
accordingly entitled to first class fare. When the
dinner bell rang, he presented himself at the table. He
was forbidden to sit down. He paid no attention to the
prohibition, and was about sitting down, when the
captain approached him menacingly, and was about
to draw the chair from under him; when the black drew
another chair, knocked the captain down, and then sat
down and eat his dinner in peace. On their arrival at
Kingston the captain complained of him for assault;
and he of the captain, for interference with his rights.
The Court fined-the black gentleman five pounds and
the captain twenty. And here is the grand difference
betwixt Yankee
<pb id="ward147" n="147"/>
and Canadian Negro-hate—the former is sanctioned by
the laws and the courts, the latter is <hi rend="italics">not.</hi> In either of
the tavern cases to which reference has been made,
the parties could have had legal redress. In my own
case, I went to a law office, and looked up the law 
upon the subject, and found it as plain as daylight; but I
did not prosecute.</p>
            <p>The other steamboat case was that of a coloured
woman, with her sister and three children, coming to
Canada from New York State, in 1851. The brutal
captain, a Scotchman, by the name of Ker, refused
them a seat anywhere else save on the deck, and
refused even to take money from them for a cabin
passage. His lying plea was, that it would be offensive
to the passengers. Every one of them distinctly denied
it, and, what is more, another coloured lady, with her
husband, had and enjoyed a cabin passage! Tell me
not that I speak too strongly about this case. The
woman is my wife, the children ours! God forgive
Captain Ker! I was stating this case one night in a
lecture, and afterwards learned that among my
hearers were several of the relatives of this same
recreant Scotchman. Glad was I that the case was told
so near home.</p>
            <p>Speaking at Paris, in the Rev. James Vincent's
church, on this subject, one night in February,
1852, the Rev. Mr. Clements, of the Wesleyan
denomination, arose after I had done, and testified
<pb id="ward148" n="148"/>
to the truthfulness of my statement by giving a case
that had come under his own observation. The case,
briefly, is this. A Scotchman, named Buchanan, one of
Her Majesty's postmasters, refused to allow Mr.
Clements admittance into his house, on a certain
night, although Mr. C. was his pastor, and the night
most stormy, and other friends distant. For what
reason, think you? Because Mr. C. had been reported
to have eaten at the same table with a black!</p>
            <p>I have known several instances in which coloured
children were denied their legal light to attend the
public schools, by their Canadian neighbours. When
Rev. Mr. King applied to Lord Elgin for the land upon
which Buxton Settlement now is—a credit to all
connected with it—his Lordship was besieged with
petitions and remonstrances against allowing land to
be sold to Negroes. I never shall forget the cool quiet
manner in which the noble Earl told me that he
disregarded the prayer of these petitions. I knew he
had, for I had been upon the land more than once; but
to hear it from his Lordship's own lips, in the presence
of his Grace the Duke of Argyll, was more than an
ordinary privilege. I recollect to have read of a case in
the township of Gosfield, county of Essex, in which
the whole mass of coloured voters were driven away
from the polling place, and disfranchised
<pb id="ward149" n="149"/>
for the time, by a low set of Gosfield
Canadians. The injured parties had recourse to
law—British law, thank Heaven!—and triumphed.</p>
            <p>Now, far be it from me to complain of any white man's
denying any Negro a seat at his table, or the
association of his family. I am free to confess that, so
far as a majority of them are concerned, <hi rend="italics">that</hi> would
be, to me, no honour—in many cases I could not
reciprocate it, consistently with my own self-respect:
and I know I speak the sentiments of my black fellow
Canadians, generally. I know, too, that every man has
a right to reject whom he pleases from his own social
circle. Exercising this right as I do, I should be the last
man in the empire to complain of it in any other man,
white or black; but when it comes to ordinary public,
purchased rights, legally provided, constitutionally
secured, and judicially enforced, I say I not only may
complain, but am entitled so to complain that my
complaint shall be both heard and felt, by the
aggressor and by all concerned. When at home, I
do not scruple to say, as also says the Rev. Hirnam
Wilson, “he who, to gratify his petty prejudice,
flies in the face of British law, to deprive the Negro
(or any other man) of his rights, is a REBEL, and as 
such ought to be treated.” Happily for us, we have equal
laws in our adopted country; and I know of no judge who
would sully
<pb id="ward150" n="150"/>
the British ermine by swerving from duty at the
bidding of prejudice, in a case coming before him as
betwixt a Negro and a white man. I know of more than
one instance in which our Canadian judges have acted
with the most honourable impartiality in such cases;
indeed, I know of no case in which they have done
otherwise.</p>
            <p>In the foregoing cases, it is seen that Canadian
Negro-hate is not confined to native Canadians: others
share it as well. One thing I have here the greatest
pleasure in saying: I never saw the slightest
appearance of it in any person in Canada recognized
there, or who would be recognized here, as a
gentleman. Either that class do not participate in the
feeling, or their good sense and good taste and good
breeding forbid its appearance. Perhaps it would not be
deemed immodest in me to say, that I have had as
ample opportunities to know “whereof I affirm” as any
black man who ever was in Canada; and I have not
observed a solitary fact contradictory to what I am now
stating. I do not expect any one to understand how
great is my pleasure in saying that, so far as my
experience goes (and that is considerable), <hi rend="italics">the British
gentleman</hi> is a gentleman everywhere, and under all
circumstances. Therefore, in every town of Canada,
and especially in Toronto, I see what I saw in but
extremely few and exceptional cases in
<pb id="ward151" n="151"/>
the States—viz., that among gentlemen, the black takes
just the place for which he is qualified, as if his colour
were similar to that of other gentlemen—as if there
were no Negro-crushing country hard by—as if there
were no Negro-hating lower classes in their midst.</p>
            <p>And now for an anomaly. Fugitives coming to
Canada are, the majority of them, young, single men.
Many more young than old, many more male than
female, come. Then, these look about them for wives.
Coloured young women are comparatively scarce;
and, in spite of the prevalent prejudice, they marry
among this very lower class of whose Negro-hate I
have said so much. Hence, while you get so much
evidence of the aversion betwixt these classes, you
see it to be no strange thing, but a very common
thing, for a black labourer to have a white wife, of a
like class. In other circumstances, one would not
wonder at it; but considering the bitter feeling of the
whites, it is, to say the least of it, an anomaly, that
blacks should propose on the one hand, and that
whites should accept on the other. However, the
history of poor human nature and its actions is full of these
anomalies. It is certainly without pain that I
add, these matches, so far as I know, are happy
ones. How far this anomaly may tend in future to
correct the prejudice, I cannot tell. How powerful, how
<pb id="ward152" n="152"/>
wide-spread, how speedy, will be its operation, are
matters upon which I do not even venture to
speculate. That it is a condescension on the part of
the white, that it at all elevates the individual Negro,
I of course deny. That the progeny of such marriages
will be physical and intellectual improvements upon
the parental stock of both sides, admits of no doubt:
whether a corresponding moral advantage will result,
is quite another thing. That is a question <hi rend="italics">of</hi> posterity;
and <hi rend="italics">for</hi> posterity, and <hi rend="italics">to</hi> posterity, I beg to leave it.</p>
            <p>I am sure I have said enough to demonstrate the need of
anti-slavery labour in Canada. My experience, everywhere,
confirmed the views I previously held on the
matter. I went at the work under such auspices as I have
mentioned, and with  such obstacles as I have
descanted upon. I will close this chapter by stating
briefly the class of encouragements afforded me in this
field of labour.</p>
            <p>1. The hearty co-operation and earnest paternal
sympathy of the Committee of the Anti-Slavery
Society of Canada.</p>
            <p>2. The very ready and very kind reception and aid
I received from ministers of the gospel, of all
denominations, and other individuals, almost without
one exception. I may say in this place, that, as a rule, the
officers and members of the Churches, and the
congregation, gave a most ready response to
<pb id="ward153" n="153"/>
the claims of our cause upon them. I have before
my mind's eye some exceptions, no doubt; but
they are in themselves and in their principles
unworthy of further notice either from myself or from
you, kind reader. And how do I know but, ere
this, they may be converts to our principles?</p>
            <p>3. I must be allowed once more to advert to the
strong British feeling pervading the better classes,
and, in this connection, to refer to many noble
Americans, resident in Canada, whose anti-slavery
principles admit of neither question nor compromise.</p>
            <p>4. The co-operation of all the better class of the
coloured people, and the evident and well defined
signs of improvement in the other classes of my
own people. Some facts illustrating the last shall
be hereafter introduced.</p>
          </div3>
          <div3 type="chapter">
            <pb id="ward154" n="154"/>
            <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
            <head>RESISTANCE TO SLAVE POLICY.</head>
            <p>THERE are supposed to be in Canada some 35,000
to 40,000 coloured people. One reason why we
cannot get at the actual numbers more accurately
is, that in taking the Census, designations of colour,
though provided for, were not made. It is only
possible, therefore, to give the approximate number,
from the best sources at command. The
number, as I have stated it, seems to be generally
regarded as correct by those who know best. The
majority of these are refugees from American
slavery: in fact, I do not believe that, with the
exception of the children born in Canada, there
are 3,000 free-born coloured persons in the whole
colony. There are, however, some, and in truth
many—and they are constantly increasing—of the
very best classes of the free blacks of both the
Northern and the Southern States, who have cast in
their lot among us. There is enough to draw them.
There is our impartial British liberty—the
<q direct="unspecified"><lg><l>“Liberty to feel, to utter, and to argue freely”—</l></lg></q>
<pb id="ward155" n="155"/>
such as they cannot have (as some of us know
from dear-bought experience) in any of the States.
Then, the climate is the most pleasant and the
most salubrious on the American continent. I
speak now particularly of Upper Canada, or
Canada West. The winter there is not so severe
as in Lower Canada, or Canada East. Yet, with
its clear, cloudless, smokeless, fogless atmosphere
—its bright blue sky, its white snowy drapery
enveloping the earth—even winter is a most
beautiful season. Add the sleighing, and an English
winter is thrown into the shade completely. The
summers are not so hot as in Lower Canada; and,
surrounded as a large portion of the Upper
Province is by vast lakes, we have both the heat and
the cold most agreeably modified. I never knew,
or heard, or read, of a more healthy country. It
would seem as if Providence designed it for a
vigorous people. Abundantly watered, beautifully
diversified, gradually rising and as gradually falling,
very regularly undulating, with but few unhealthy
marshes, and, when somewhat damp, becoming dry
upon the first felling of the forests, it would seem
as if nought but health could abide, nought but vigour
could abound, there.</p>
            <p>And the land is so excellent. None better, to use an
Americanism, “lies out of doors.” Skilled,
<pb id="ward156" n="156"/>
persevering labour, is remunerated upon that soil with
an unequalled abundance. Besides, Canadians
(especially since the Reciprocity Treaty) enjoy the best
markets, near and distant, on the continent. And, lastly,
the land is so cheap. The Government sells the best
lands in the country at from six to eight shillings the
acre, and allows ten years' credit, at annual payments.
There are companies and private individuals as well,
who are selling lands at most reasonable prices. These
advantages prove alluring to some of the best of our
people in the States; and they see, too, that all other
branches of business flourish as does agriculture.
Hence, with that restless and resistless desire for
improvement which the coloured man in all parts of
America is now making manifest, many of them “shake
off the dust” of the persecuting cities of their native
land, and come to us. The condition, prospects,
progress, enterprise, manhood, every way exhibited by
this class, make them what they deserve to be, the
esteemed of all classes whose good opinion is worth
having. I see a recent traveller says, “there is not a
respectable coloured family in Toronto.” That is like 
“Sam Slick” (Judge Haliburton) saying, “a Negro
gentleman is out of the question.” I would say to that
bold false writer, and to that Negro-disparaging judge,
what Robert Emmett said to Judge
<pb id="ward157" n="157"/>
Norbury—“There are men united with me * * * * * who
are superior to your own conceptions of yourself, my
Lord.”</p>
            <p>But, as I have said, and as is well known—too
well known in the Slave States—the mass of our
Negro population are refugees from American
despotism. So early as 1824<ref targOrder="U" id="ref5" n="5" rend="sc" target="note5">*</ref><note id="note5" n="5" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref5"><p>* Judge Jay's “View of the Action of the Federal Government
on behalf of Slavery.”</p></note> the attention of the
American Government was turned to the numbers
then escaped and escaping to Canada. In 1827
the Secretary of State<ref targOrder="U" id="ref6" n="6" rend="sc" target="note6">†</ref><note id="note6" n="6" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref6"><p>† Honourable Henry Clay.</p></note> spoke of it as “a growing
evil.” The same year, the British Government
were besought to make a treaty for the extradition
of slaves. In 1842, when the Ashburton Treaty
was made, they wished to smuggle into it a
provision to this effect; and a little while after, an
effort was made to pervert the tenth article of that
treaty, to make it authorize the delivery of fugitives
from slavery, as felons. But the British Government
consenting to none of these propositions, this
“evil,” as Mr. Clay called it thirty years ago, continues
to “grow.” Its “growth” is giving us a 
most vigorous, most loyal, most useful population,
whose presence and increase among us is every
way most welcome.</p>
            <p>It is a matter of great difficulty for them to
<pb id="ward158" n="158"/>
reach Canada. It follows, that <hi rend="italics">but few</hi> comparatively
can come. There is no country in the world so much
hated by slaveholders, as Canada; nor is there any
country so much beloved and sought for, by the
slaves. These two feel thus oppositely towards our
fair province for the same reason—IT IS A FREE
COUNTRY. As Cowper said of England, so is true of
Canada. There, too,
<q direct="unspecified"><lg><l>“Slaves cannot breathe.</l><l>“They touch our country, and their shackles
fall.”</l></lg></q></p>
            <p>Miss Martineau was told by a gentleman, that the
sublimest sight in North America is the leap of a slave
from a boat to the Canadian shore. That “leap”
transforms him from a marketable chattel to a free
man. Hence that “leap” is far more sublime than the
plunge of the Niagara River from its natural bed to the
deep, deep, receptacle of its voluminous waters, far
below. But when it is remembered how much of
difficulty the poor American slave has to encounter, in
preparing for his escape, and in making it—how every
step of the way is beset with peril and threatening
disaster—then one could see in that “leap” so much of the
consummation of long and fondly cherished hope,
hope nurtured on the very brink of despair, so much
of real true manhood, as to give a better insight into
its real “sublimity” than a mere casual glance could
afford. To the better feelings of our common
<pb id="ward159" n="159"/>
manhood, it is most gratefying to see a man
made free by an effort of peaceful though energetic
heroism; but to know how much that effort has
cost him, and to know that he has both counted
and paid the cost, is more gratifying still. The
one gives us, it may be, but a momentary thrill
of delight; the other awakens and fixes our
admiration.</p>
            <p>When I say that our immigrant and oft-coming<ref targOrder="U" id="ref7" n="7" rend="sc" target="note7">*</ref>
<note id="note7" n="7" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref7"><p>* Through the enactment of the Fugitive Slave Law they have

of them, were obliged to flee.</p></note>fugitives are a most welcome accession to our
population, the reader may smile and say, “That is all
very well in one Negro to say of others of the same
class.” But I say it in view of the wants of our colony,
and of the character of these people. What the former
are I will state in few words—labourers
of real sterling industry; what the latter is shall be
inferred from what they show themselves to be, as
slaves, as fugitives, and as freemen. I use this 
peculiar nomenclature for the sake of perspicuity and
logical correctness. The fugitive is different on
the plantation from what he is flying. When he
reaches Canada, he is no longer either a slave or
a fugitive, but a freeman.</p>
            <p>1.  I hesitate not to affirm, that the class of slaves
who escape to Canada are generally the most
<pb id="ward160" n="160"/>
valuable of the whole stock. Ordinarily, as Jefferson says,
“men are more apt to bear evils than to put
themselves to the peril and trouble of getting rid of
them.” Ordinary men submit to, and try to make the
best of, what they suffer. Besides, oppression cramps
and dwarfs the mind so as to make it mean enough,
most frequently, to submit to what is imposed upon it,
if not without murmurings and repinings, at least
without very vigorous efforts, either in the mass or in
individuals, to better themselves.</p>
            <p>I hope I need not say, that Negroes do not furnish
the only or the worst illustrations of this fact. Around
the American slave, however, are placed all manner of
obstacles to his escape, and over him the most vigilant
surveillance is constantly exercised. The fear of his
running away is constantly present to the mind of his
master, and against it all manner of precautions are
used. The slave may not learn to read or write—it
would better prepare him to make his escape; he may
not be out after ten o'clock at night, “without written
permission”; he may not be absent from his master's
premises after nightfall, at all, “without written
permission”; he may not be away, any distance from
home, day or night, “without written permission.” If
found otherwise, he is apprehended, imprisoned, and
advertised, as a runaway. If detected as actually
<pb id="ward161" n="161"/>
guilty of running away, or of being liable to
reasonable suspicion of the crime (for it is such), he
will receive the severest possible punishment. His
punishment is more than ordinarily cruel for the
fault—desire for freedom, in the freest country under
the sun—both to cure him of any such desire or
tendency in future, and to intimidate other slaves.</p>
            <p>All this the slave knows before he starts—indeed,
before he determines to start. Then, he occasionally
receives a lecture on the bad climate and worse
customs of Canada. All manner of bugbears are put
before him, touching this country. Sometimes,
however, they go too far in this direction. I
have heard slaves say, “We knew Canada was a
good country for us, because master was so anxious
that we should <hi rend="italics">not</hi> go there.” Such have learnt to
interpret their masters pretended solicitude in their
behalf as the Irish interpret their dreams, “by
<sic corr="contraries">conthraries</sic>.” In case a Negro has the stubbornness (it
would be called bravery and fortitude in a white man)
to go to Canada, in spite of his master's contrary
wish, in spite of all he has heard against it, and in
spite of all he has heard and seen of punishment—and,
it may be, has felt of it too—then he must consider what
he is about. He must impart his secret to no one; not
even his bosom friend may be trusted. Then, what he
does by way of preparation must be done most
stealthily.
<pb id="ward162" n="162"/>
At that time, of all times, he must appear best satisfied with
slavery, least anxious for freedom. He has no means of
purchasing the articles he needs for his journey. His
conscience may be tender as to whether he should
appropriate to himself what he deems necessary for his
escape, from his master's possession, without leave.
Sometimes their consciences give them far less trouble than
the vigilant eyes of their masters. It is true, however, that
there are slaves so completely under the control of
religious scruples, as to refuse to appropriate not only what
they need for their escape, but what they need to live
upon. Frederic Douglas says, that while a slave, for a
length of time he felt conscientiously opposed to the taking
of such food or animals as he really needed for his
sustenance. An old Negro preacher, however, who was
more skilled in casuistry, determined to convert him from
his needless scruples. On one occasion he reasoned with
him after the following manner:—</p>
            <p>“Federic, are not <hi rend="italics">you</hi> master's property?”</p>
            <p>“Yes,” said Frederic.</p>
            <p>“Well; is not yon pig master's property also?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, I see that.”</p>
            <p>“Well then; if you take the pig, which is
master's property, and put it <hi rend="italics">inside of Federic,</hi> which
is master's property, has not master got both pieces
of his <hi rend="italics">property together?”</hi></p>
            <pb id="ward163" n="163"/>
            <p>“Yes,” replied Frederic, perfectly reconciled, and
relieved of all doubts on the subject from that
day forth.</p>
            <p>Some do, and some do not, become entangled
with such difficulties; whether they do or not,
thousands of obstacles surround them. Any one
may betray their secret, if knowing it, and hence
everything must be kept to themselves.</p>
            <p>A man entrusted with a plan of importance grows
with it. If it be the fruit of his own thoughts and one
of his own purposes, he is more of a man for
having conceived it. If it must be wrought out
with his own unaided hands, it improves him to
entertain the intention of doing it. If in the way
of his resolution—and, still more, in the way of
executing it—there stand many mighty obstacles
of which he is aware, but the existence of
which appals him not, he has in him all the 
elements of your moral or physical hero, or of both.
Now, the slave intending, planning, determining to
escape, is one of that class. He knows he must lie
in the woods all day—that he can only travel in
the night—that he must not be seen in any public
thoroughfare—that no animal of the earth is so
much to be dreaded and avoided as <hi rend="italics">man</hi>—that
cold, and wet, and hunger, and thirst, and 
approaching nakedness, are among the most ordinary
adjuncts of his toilsome journey. Worst of all, he
<pb id="ward164" n="164"/>
knows that the keen scent of the well-trained
bloodhound—a dog educated like an American, and by
an American, to hate and worry a Negro<ref targOrder="U" id="ref8" n="8" rend="sc" target="note8">*</ref><note id="note8" n="8" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref8"><p>* These dogs are trained by being set upon young negroes, in their

enough naturally, but made ten thousandfold worse
by his republican, Bible-defended<ref targOrder="U" id="ref9" n="9" rend="sc" target="note9">†</ref><note id="note9" n="9" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref9"><p>† The divine who defend slavery from the Bible, defend this
practise as well.</p></note> training: as well as
the swiftest hunter, the most ferocious of all, the
human professional Negro-catcher—will be upon his
track. They may overtake him; they may overpower
him, and drag him back! Then the hottest part of the
hell of slavery is to be his portion. Still he holds on his
purpose, defies the dangers, battles the obstacles,
stills the palpitations of his own trembling heart, and
makes his preparations and—his <hi rend="italics">exit.</hi></p>
            <p>Now, not only the philosophy of the case declares
this man to be superior to those generally
surrounding him, those he leaves behind him, but, as
in the case of other refugees, the history of the case
agrees with its philosophy. The slaves advertised as
having run away, or as having been arrested upon
suspicion of being runaways—as any one
may see in any Southern newspaper, political or
religious—are men and women of mark. “Large frames”
are ascribed to them; “intelligent countenances;” “can
read a little;” “may pass, or
<pb id="ward165" n="165"/>
attempt to pass, as-a freeman;” “a good mechanic;”
“had a bold look;” “above the middle height,
very ingenious, may pass for white;” “very intelligent.”
No one who has seen such advertisements
can fail to be struck with them. A mulattress left
her master, Mr. Devonport, in Syracuse, in 1839,
who “had no traces of African origin”: as advertised.
Mr. D. said she was worth 2,500 dollars,
nearly £500. Such are the slaves who run away,
as a rule. I do not deny that some of “inferior lots”
come too, but such as those described form the <hi rend="italics">rule.</hi></p>
            <p>Then, as fugitives, when we recollect what they
must undergo in every part of their <hi rend="italics">exodus,</hi> we can
but see them as among the most admirable of any
race. The fugitive exercises patience, fortitude,
and perseverance, connected with and fed by an
ardent and unrestrained and resistless love
of liberty, such as causes men to admired everywhere
—that is, <hi rend="italics">white men everywhere,</hi> but in the
United States. The lonely, toiling journey; the
endurance of the excitement from constant danger;
the hearing the yell and howl of the bloodhound;
the knowledge of close, hot pursuit; the dread of
capture, and the determination not to be taken
alive—all these, furnaces of trial as they are, purify
and ennoble the man who has to pass through
them. All these are inseparable from the ordinary
incidents in the northward passage of the fugitive:
<pb id="ward166" n="166"/>
and when he reaches us, he is, first, what the raw
material of nature was; and, secondly, what the
improving process of flight has made him. Both have
fitted him the more highly to appreciate, the more
fully to enjoy, and the more wisely to use, that for
which he came to us, for which he was willing to
endure all things, for which, indeed, he would have
yielded life itself—liberty.</p>
            <p>Let me illustrate these points by a few facts. A
Negro, Madison Washington by name—a name, a pair of
names, of which he was well worthy—was a slave in
Virginia. He determined to be free. He fled to Canada
and became free. There the noble fellow was
dissatisfied—so dissatisfied, that he determined to
leave free Canada, and return to Virginia: and
wherefore? His wife was there, a <hi rend="italics">slave.</hi> Freedom was
too sweet to be enjoyed without her. That she was a
slave marred his joys. She must share them, even at
the risk of <hi rend="italics">his</hi> losing them. So in 1841 he went back to
Virginia, to the neighbourhood in which his wife
lived, lingered about in the woods, and sent word to
her of his whereabouts; others were unfortunately
informed as well, and he was captured, taken to
Washington, and sold to a Negro-trader. One
scarcely knows which most to admire—the heroism this
man displayed in the freeing of himself, or the noble
manliness that risked all for the freedom of his wife.
One cannot
<pb id="ward167" n="167"/>
help thinking that, as his captors led Madison
Washington to the slave pen, they must have been
smitten with the thought that they were handling a man
far superior to themselves. When a load of Negroes
had been made up, Madison Washington, with a large
number of others—119, I think—was put on board the
schooner “Creole,” to sail out of the mouth of the
Potomac River and southwards to the Gulf of Mexico,
up the Mississippi, and to New Orleans, the great
slave-buying port of America. But on the night of the
9th of November, 1841, Madison Washington and two
others, named respectively Pompey Garrison, and Ben
Blacksmith, arose upon the captain and crew, leading
all the other slaves after them, and gave the captain the
alternative of sailing the vessel into a British port, one
of the Bahamas, or of going overboard. The captain,
wisely and safely for himself, chose the former; and
these three brave blacks, naturally distrusting the
forced promise of the Yankee captain, stood sentry
over him until he <hi rend="italics">did</hi> steer the “Creole” into the
port of Nassau, island of <hi rend="italics">New Providence,</hi> touching
which they became freemen. The United States
Government, through the Honourable Edward Everett,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref10" n="10" rend="sc" target="note10">*</ref>
<note id="note10" n="10" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref10"><p>* This was during the time when the Honourable Daniel Webster first

gold to pay for these men. The Court of St.
James entertained the demand—not one moment. What
lacked these men of being Tells, Mazzinis, and
Kossuths, in their way, except white or whitish skins?</p>

            <head>FUGITIVES EVINCE TRUE HEROISM.</head>
            <p>AMONG the many who come to us from slavery, it
cannot be expected that all, or many, should be
such as the three described in the closing part of
the last chapter. I do not pretend any such thing.
Slavery is not the sort of institution for the training
and producing of such men. Many, too many, bear
with them the indelible marks of the accursed lot to
which they have been doomed, in early life. It is
almost impossible to spend youth, manhood, and the
greater part of life, in such a condition as that of
the American slave, and entirely escape, or to any
great extent ever become free from, the legitimate
influences of it upon the whole character. It is so
with slaveholders. They never, during life, lose
the overbearing insolence, the reckless morals, the
peculiarly inelegant manners, and the profligate
habits, which distinguish too many of them. Why
should slaves be expected to be better than what
they have been made, by the institution which has
crushed them? Indeed, though I recollect nothing
<pb id="ward170" n="170"/>
of slavery, I am every day showing something of my
slave origin. It is among my thoughts, my
superstitions, my narrow views, my awkwardness of
manners. Ah, the infernal impress is upon me, and I
fear I shall transmit it to my children, and they to
theirs! How deeply seated, how far reaching, a curse
it is!</p>
            <p>All I claim for the Negro settler is, that as a
slave, a fugitive, and a freeman, he is equal to other
poor immigrants, superior to many, and from among
the very best of his own class; and that, take him all
in all, he is just such a man as our new country needs—
a lover of freedom, a loyal subject, an industrious
man.</p>
            <p>I fear that I should leave an unfair impression upon
the minds of my readers, if I did not give other
instances of the class and condition of fugitives, than
the case of Madison Washington and his compatriots.
Some are not nearly so fortunate. One poor man came
to my house, in Toronto, who had fled from North
Carolina, leaving behind him a wife and four children,
whom he had no expectation of seeing again on earth.
He was four-and-thirty years old; and at <hi rend="italics">that</hi> age, while
enjoying freedom, and having shown the manliness to escape,
bearing all the perils of his flight most bravely, his
poor heart must be sunken in sorrow by the gloomy
recollection that all dear to him were 1,400
<pb id="ward171" n="171"/>
miles away; in <hi rend="italics">slavery.</hi> Few men, of any race, would
retain sufficient energy of body, or soul, or mind, to
bear up under such evils; but this poor fellow went to
work in the service of a friend of mine, who wrote me
in 1853 concerning him that “he spends his leisure in
learning to read, in which he is quite successful.”</p>
            <p>Another came to me at the age of sixty-one. He had
spent his best days in the service of a man who had
frequently sent him with six horses, as a teamster, to
Pennsylvania (thereby making him free, though the
poor man did not know it), and whom he had served till
his death. His master's sons sold him to a Negro-trader.
Returning to the house at the close of his day's
labour, one evening, he was informed of his being
sold. He could not believe that lads to whom he had
been so kind <hi rend="italics">could</hi> sell him. Poor man! little did he
dream of the ingratitude of a slaveholding Yankee. He
was called to his supper, which, instead of being set in
the kitchen as usual, was set in a small room to which
there was but one door, and the table stood behind that
door. Woodfolk, the Negro-trader, was in an adjoining
room, viewing him with professional interest. The
presence of this demi-demon, the arrangements for
supper, and the appearance of matters generally, but
too clearly revealed to him that the information he had
received was quite
<pb id="ward172" n="172"/>
correct. He saw that, should he sit down <hi rend="italics">there</hi> to
supper, Woodfolk and the young men could, like
tigers, spring upon him; and there being no chance
of escape, he could be overpowered and borne off,
in spite of any resistance he might make. Wisely
concluding that “discretion is the better part of
valour,” he went out as if to look after the horses
he was accustomed to attend, <hi rend="italics">and never returned.</hi>
His wife lived some two miles distant: should he
visit her, to bid her farewell? No! for so soon as
they missed him, they would suspect he was gone to
see her, and therefore that would be the first place
to which they would repair in quest of him.
Besides, was it not wise to gain time by taking
advantage of this fact? He adopted the latter plan,
kept the barn behind him, went to the woods,
followed the North Star, and journeyed patiently
until he arrived, in the character of a freeman,
the first time in his life, upon the soil of a free
country.</p>
            <p>At first, I could not make the old man believe that
he was really in a free country; but the kindness
shown by the Ladies' Society for the Aid of Destitute
Fugitives brought the fact gradually, like the approach
of dawn to his vision, and then he came to me in
haste, demanding to be sent away to work. He needed
no more rest; he was not ill, as he had supposed; he
could scarcely believe he
<pb id="ward173" n="173"/>
was old and weak—he was <hi rend="italics">free!</hi> that was youth, health,
rest, strength, all things. He was sent to the county
of Lincoln, where he obtained employment; and he is
now working out the problems of his maintenance as
successfully as any man of his years, in that part of
Her Majesty's empire.</p>
            <p>Another was so unfortunate as to be obliged to travel
in the winter. I met him at a ferry on the Niagara
River, crossing from Niagara, on the British side, to
Youngstown, on the New York side. It was a bitterly
cold day, the 11th of January, 1853. Crossing the river,
it was so cold that icicles were formed upon my
clothes, as the waves dashed the water into the ferry
boat. It was difficult for the Rev. H. Wilson and myself—
we travelled together—to keep ourselves warm while
driving; and my horses, at a most rapid rate, travelled
twelve miles almost without sweating. That day, this
poor fellow crossed that ferry with nothing upon his
person but cotton clothing, and an oilcloth topcoat.
Liberty was before him, and for it he could defy the
frost. I had observed him, when I was in the office of
the ferry, sitting not <hi rend="italics">at,</hi> but <hi rend="italics">all around,</hi> the stove; for
he literally <hi rend="italics">surrounded and covered it</hi> with his
shivering legs and arms and trunk. And what delighted
me was, everybody in the office seemed quite content
that he should
<pb id="ward174" n="174"/>
occupy what he had discovered and appropriated. I
yielded my share without a word of complaint. There
was not much of the stove, and we all let him enjoy
what there was of it.</p>
            <p>The ferryman was a bit of a wag—a noble, generous
Yankee; who, when kind, like the Irish, are the most
humane of men. Upon asking the fare of the ferry, I
was told it was a shilling. Said I, “Must I pay now, or
when I get on the other side?”</p>
            <p>“Now, I guess, if you please.”</p>
            <p>“But suppose I go to the bottom, I lose the value
of my shilling,” I expostulated.</p>
            <p>“So shall I lose mine, if you go to the bottom
without paying in advance,” was his cool reply.</p>
            <p>I submitted, of course. When partly across, he said
to me, “Stranger, you saw that 'ere black man near
the stove in the office, didn't you?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, I saw him, <hi rend="italics">very near</hi> it, <hi rend="italics">all around</hi> it—<hi rend="italics">all over</hi> it,
for that matter.”</p>
            <p>“Wall, if you can do anything for him, I would
thank you, for he is really in need. He is a fugitive. I
just now brought him across. I am sure he has
nothing, for he had but fourpence to pay his ferry.”</p>
            <p>“But you charged <hi rend="italics">me a shilling,</hi> and made me
pay in advance.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, but I tell you what; when a darky comes
<pb id="ward175" n="175"/>
to this ferry from slavery, I guess he'll get across,
shilling or no shilling, money or no money.”</p>
            <p>Knowing as I did that a Yankee's—a good Yankee's—
<hi rend="italics">guess</hi> is equal to any other man's oath, I could but
believe him. He further told me, that sometimes, when
they had money, fugitives would give him five
shillings for putting them across the ferry which
divided what they call Egypt from Canaan. In one case
a fugitive insisted upon his taking twenty-four times
the regular fare. Upon the ferryman's refusing, the
Negro conquered by saying, “Keep it, then, as a fund
to pay the ferriage of fugitives who cannot pay for
themselves.”</p>
            <p>While I was upon the journey in the course of
which the foregoing occurred, a man arrived at
Toronto who had come from the South, travelling on
foot, wearing out his shoes, and freezing his feet so
that for a fortnight he could not stand upon them. He,
as are all others in like circumstances, was attended to
and provided for at the expense of those “Sisters of
Mercy,” the Ladies' Society, to which I referred in a
preceding page; and being a stonecutter by trade, so
soon as he was able to stand he found employment in
one of our best stonecutter's yards, and proved to be
a most serviceable skilful workman.</p>
            <p>I will give one or two instances of the difficulties.
<pb id="ward176" n="176"/>
which beset them on their way. Andrew Jackson,
a well known and dearly beloved man, was,
after he started, beset by five slave-catchers, who
were determined to take him back. Andrew told
me, that when they demanded his surrender and
return, he pointedly refused, and placed himself in
an attitude of defence and defiance. He says,
“they came upon me, and I used a hickory stick I
had in my hands. Striking them as hard and as
often as I could, with each blow I prayed, ‘Lord,
save! Lord, save!’ <corr sic="missing punctuation">“</corr>Now,” said he, “had I simply,
cried, ‘Lord, save!’ without using my hickory, they
would have taken me. Now I know that faith and
works go together.” He conquered; flogging the five,
as he said, by God's blessing upon the energetic use
of his hickory. I believe him. Who does not?</p>
            <p>Another man, of whom the Rev. Mr. McClure
(as true a friend to the Negro as ever drew
breath) told me, ran away in the absence of his
master, not knowing whither he had gone. He
arrived at the Niagara River without serious
mishap, and was just about to cross, and make
the “leap” of which Miss Martineau speaks. But
he cautiously approached the river's brink, and
looked up and down before <hi rend="italics">borrowing</hi> a boat,
there being no ferry very near, and he preferring
to cross quietly and privately, in that
<pb id="ward177" n="177"/>
manner: but down the river he saw a man
fishing, whose appearance he did not particularly like.
He hesitated. The man turned his face
towards him. It was the face of his master! In an instant, he ran—almost
flew—from the margin
of the river, to gain the suspension bridge close at
hand, and cross it. His master pursued. On he
flew: he gained the bridge; so did his master.
He ran for life, and liberty—the master ran for
property: the former had freedom to win, the
latter feared the loss of chattel. On both ran,
the Negro being ahead some few “lengths,”
and showing a most practical disposition to keep
so. The keeper of the tollgate encouraged the
Negro, who, though breathless, redoubled his energies
and almost multiplied his speed at every
bound, until he reached the Canadian end of the
bridge—when he suddenly stopped, his haste being
over, the goal having been reached, the prize won.
He looked his former master, who had just “arrived
in time to be too late,” calmly in the eye, with a 
smile of satisfaction and triumph overspreading his
features. The two were equals: both were free.
The former slave knew it right well. Hence that
calm triumphant smile.</p>
            <p>I heard of one who, like the man just spoken
of, reached the Erie River at Black Rock, near
Buffalo, and in sight of that Canada which had
<pb id="ward178" n="178"/>
been the object of his fondest desires, and had
actually gone upon the ferryboat to be conveyed to
his much-wished-for free home. The ferryman was
loosing the boat from the shore, when, to his utter
dismay, up rode his master upon a foaming steed, and
with a look
<q direct="unspecified"><lg><l>“Like the sunshine when it flashes on steel,”</l></lg></q>
drew his loaded pistol, and plainly told the
ferryman—“If you loose that boat to convey my
Negro to the opposite bank, I'll <hi rend="italics">blow</hi> your brains out!”</p>
            <p>The Negro in an instant seized a handspike, and,
holding it menacingly over the ferryman's head, said,
“If you don't loose the boat and ferry me across, I'll
<hi rend="italics">beat</hi> your brains out!”</p>
            <p>The ferryman, one of the best of his class, a
Yankee, friendly to the Negro, looked a moment, first
at the one and then at the other, seeing both equally
determined and decided, and expressed his decision.
He said coolly, “Wall! I can't die but <hi rend="italics">once;</hi> and if I
die, I guess I would rather die doing right. So here goes
the boat.”</p>
            <p>He loosed it and shoved it off. While this
was being done, the slaveholder, seeing his slave,
who had always
<q direct="unspecified"><lg><l>“Fanned him while he slept, and trembled when he woke,”</l></lg></q>
defy him, with a threatening gesture at a
white man, was thunderstruck. He sate in mute
astonishment. His countenance reflected the state of
<pb id="ward179" n="179"/>
his surprised mind. He was transfixed, as it were,
to his saddle. He gazed with a stupid glare, as if
he saw not, while the boat sped her way Canada-wards.
The Negro, on the other hand, watched
every inch of progress which widened the distance
betwixt the two shores, until, not waiting for the
boat to touch, he ran back to the stern, and then,
with a full bound like a nimble deer, sprang from the
boat to the shore in advance of the boat, and, rising,
took off his poor old hat, and gave three cheers for
for the British sovereign.</p>
            <p>From my native State, Maryland, in 1853, four
young men started, under the following circumstances.
One of them was to be sold—a doom
which the slave dreads next to perdition. He at
once concluded that he would meet the perils of
running away before he would suffer himself to be
sold from his somewhat comfortable home. He
imparted his secret, unhappily; to some few, as he
supposed, trusty friends. Arming themselves, they
started together. They travelled every night, they
concealed themselves during the days, until they
reached and crossed the border of Pennsylvania. One
morning, as they were entering a place of
safety for the day, a dog came to them, barking; the
dog was quickly followed by a biped. The latter,
assuming the language of a Quaker for his base
purposes, addressed them kindly, offered them
<pb id="ward180" n="180"/>
a breakfast, and bade them follow him into his house.
They did so. He gave them the first hearty meal they
had eaten since leaving home. After breakfast, he
showed them a place of safety, in his barn. He left
them, and returned a few hours after, and brought with
him eight men, to take them as fugitive slaves! Two of
them yielded at once. The other two fought until one
of them was overpowered. The other continued to
fight until his right arm was riddled with shot, and fell
powerless at his side; then he threw his pistol at them,
and they took him. This was the leader, the one who
first proposed the escape. His captors found his arm
needed the care of a surgeon before he could be safely
removed. They therefore, instead of taking him back to
Maryland immediately, as they proposed to do with
the other three, caused him to be put to bed in the
second story of the inn where they lodged, and
obtained surgical aid for him.</p>
            <p>Having achieved so signal a victory—these eight
brave Anglo-Saxons—over four Negroes, two of
whom did <hi rend="italics">not</hi> fight! they felt that both
their valour and their victory (to say nothing of their
stomachs) were worthy of a celebration., A celebration,
with free drinking of wine, &amp;c., they had, and
in it they got into a state of <hi rend="italics">sublimity.</hi> The
Negro, knowing what was going on, and, though
<pb id="ward181" n="181"/>
foiled, not defeated, arose stealthily from his bed,
took the bedcord out of his bedstead, fastened it
to the window, and let himself down, by his left
hand and his teeth, to the ground. He dragged
himself away to the woods, and made good his
escape to a town that shall be nameless—found
a friend in the gentleman who gave me the facts,
and was finally sent to Canada, where he arrived
safely, a crippled but a free man.</p>
            <p>This may remind the reader of the case of William
Thomas, a fugitive, of whom we read in the
London “Times” in August, 1853. This man had
fled from Virginia to Pennsylvania, and was waiter in a
hotel at Wilkesbarre, in the beautiful Wyoming
Valley, on the banks of the Susquehannah River. He
had lived there some years; but being traced by the
agents of his master, <hi rend="italics">five</hi> men came to the hotel and
called for food. William waited upon them. They eat
and paid; and while he was going to his master with
the money, these cowards came behind him stealthily,
and struck him a stunning blow, which brought him
senseless to the floor. They then put handcuffs on
him, and arrested him as a fugitive; this being the first
intimation they gave that such was the purpose for
which they had come. In a few minutes poor William
recovered partially from the effects of the blow,
arose quickly, and with the
<pb id="ward182" n="182"/>
handcuffs flogged his five captors; and then, not
before, ran to the river.</p>
            <p>He went into the water up to his chin. His
pursuers followed him to the bank, and commanded
him to come out. He plainly declared
that he preferred drowning to being carried back
to Virginia, a slave. The slave-catchers then shot
him in the head. He sank; the blood from his
wounded head commingling itself with the waters
of the Susquehannah. He soon afterwards rose to
the surface, and was about to approach the shore,
as the brave men who were in quest of him had
left the river, saying that it was “scarcely worth
while to take a dead nigger to Virginia”; but as
he came near the shore they returned to take him.
He went back into the river, sunk beneath its
surface, and, while under, made the best of his way
unobserved down the stream; then, after a little
while, got out, and stealthily reached the cottage
of a poor black woman in the neighbourhood, who
kindly took care of him until he was well enough
to be sent to Canada. What would such poor
fellows do, if it were not for the British American
possessions? Can the reader blame me for believing,
that the All Merciful One has preserved
that land from the hands of the Americans, almost
on purpose to shelter the outcast?</p>
            <p>I am sorry to be obliged to add, that the United
<pb id="ward183" n="183"/>
States Circuit Court decided that these five men used
no undue, unnecessary, or illegal severity, in
their attempt to take William Thomas. So pronounced
his Honour Judge Grier, an elder in a Presbyterian
Church!</p>
            <p>A poor fellow, having escaped one day, was
pursued in the afternoon by professional man-hunters,
Negro-catchers, with bloodhounds. They were upon
his track, gained upon him, and would surely have him
if he did not resort to some artifice. Fortunately there
was, near by, a morass. He knew that in the water the
dogs would lose the scent. He therefore went
into the morass, sunk down to his neck, threw his head
backward beneath some bulrushes, and thus concealed
himself while he could see and hear all that passed.
The dogs were at fault. The horses could not enter the
bog; or, if they did, they might find it not so easy to
come out. The men were vexed. They knew he was
there somewhere, but exactly where they could
not determine. Had they seen him, they would in all
probability have shot him. They shouted, they swore,
but all to no purpose. At last, night came on, and they
were far from home; they must therefore return, and,
to their mortification, they must go without the Negro.
After their departure he came out, but so benumbed
that he was scarcely able to stand. By extraordinary
exertions, however,
<pb id="ward184" n="184"/>
he recovered warmth, and pursued his journey
until he reached a land of freedom. In his native
country, there is not a square inch of territory where
either he or poor Thomas could be free and safe. He
told me, he thought his case <hi rend="italics">somewhat</hi> resembled
that of Moses; he had been hid in the bulrushes, and
thus saved!</p>
            <p>One more case must suffice, both to illustrate my
position and to close this chapter. It is that of a poor
pious man who was a slave in Maryland, some twenty-seven
miles from Baltimore. His master was a lawyer—a
free and easy sort of person, who generally visited
his plantation but once a fortnight, having his
office in Baltimore. The slave I
speak of had a wife, and they had a child some few
months old, all of whom were the property of this
young lawyer. These slaves, and some others in
the vicinity, had resolved upon being free. They
made their arrangements for going to Canada, and
wisely arranged to start on the Saturday night
on which the master of the man, wife and child,
was not to be at the plantation. They were to
meet a waggon at a place some few miles distant,
to which they were to travel on foot. They slept
in a bedroom next to that in which their master
slept. A window, looking out of their bedroom
upon the road, was near the partition, and therefore
near the master's room; but besides this, a like
<pb id="ward185" n="185"/>
window was equally near the partition, in his room.
Their arrangements were all made; the time was
approaching; the Saturday came; evening drew
on; and with it, contrary to his custom and to their
expectation, came their master.</p>
            <p>Ordinary persons would have given up, or at
least postponed, this journey. Not so did this
couple. They consulted, and determined to proceed
with the plan. The wife was especially determined.
At length the hour for starting approached.
They listened: all was still in their master's room,
save the noise of his deep breathing, as he slept
soundly. It was a clear, frosty, starlight night,
peculiar to an American autumn—it was November.
In silent prayer this pair bowed, and, rising, felt
what seemed to them new inspiration. Perhaps it
was the calmness of soul resulting from an earnest
trust in the God of the poor and the needy; perhaps
it was the foreshadowing of new evils to come,
and a sort of gathering up the soul's energies for
a new conflict; perhaps—but why speculate? 
They had committed themselves to God, “as to a 
faithful Creator,” and they set about what they felt
to be duty. Softly they raised the window, and 
then listened to ascertain whether the sound of it
had attracted attention. They heard nothing but
the deep breathing of the sleeper in the next
apartment, within, and chirrup of the cricket without.
<pb id="ward186" n="186"/>
The man went out of the window: did any one hear?
No. Now comes a difficulty. Out of the warm bed,
where it had been nestling in its mother's bosom, into
the cold frosty air of a November night, must this
child of a few months be taken, and so passed from
the hands of the mother to those of the father. A cry
from that child—and how natural that a child should
cry, in the circumstances!—would betray them. Could it
be taken out silently? They must try; they did try; they
succeeded. The babe was still, and lay in a sleep
almost motionless, in his father's arms outside the
window.</p>
            <p>Safely, as speedily and silently, the mother moved
out, lowered the window. No one heard, all was still;
and they started with hearts beating almost audibly,
and leaping almost into their throats. They walked to
the place of rendezvous; but so high were their
hopes, so cheerful was their conversation, that they
almost realized my friend Joseph Payne, Esq's, favourite
quotation—“A good companion on a journey is better
than a coach.” Almost ere they knew it, they were at
the appointed place; but the waggon and the other parties
were not there. There were no footprints, no wheel tracks:
they had not yet come. They could afford, they
thought, to wait, and they did wait. But, to their grief
and disappointment, neither the waggon
nor the rest of the party appeared; and they, alternating
<pb id="ward187" n="187"/>
between hope and fear, remained shivering in
the cold, until it became but too evident that the
others must have met with some hindrance which
had prevented their departure. The night advanced,
morning began to approach. They saw that they
must return, and that speedily, or they would not
be able to enter their bedroom without awakening
either their master or some of the neighbours. To
make sure of returning under cover of the night,
they must retrace their steps at once.</p>
            <p>As they returned, one would naturally enough
think, their minds would dwell somewhat gloomily
upon this sad disappointment. Their conversation,
however, was animated, for they were in a dispute. The
wife insisted upon a proposal to which the husband
would not listen. But she was eloquent: wives, when in
earnest, always are. The opposition grew feebler and
feebler, until at last he sought peace, as discomfited
husbands generally seek it, by saying, “Well, my
dear, if you insist upon it, with the help of God I'll try.”
The victory overcame her: she was silent, tearful, and
they walked on, until, collecting herself, she threw her
arms about his  neck, as he held the child, and said
with a full heart, as none but a wife can say, “God
bless you, my husband!” Why had they been
disputing, and about what?</p>
            <p>After the disappointment, the wife, with a tenacity
peculiar to the sex, found it impossible to give
<pb id="ward188" n="188"/>
up the idea of freedom for <hi rend="italics">some</hi> of the party. She
could not endure the idea that <hi rend="italics">all</hi> of them should
return to hopeless bondage. Like other women,
she thought she could endure more than her husband
could at home, while she had no doubt of
his ability to meet trouble abroad. She therefore
proposed that he should go on and seek freedom,
while she, with the child, should return. Opposing
this, as we have seen, without success, he yielded
the contest, but insisted upon accompanying her
back to the home they had left a few hours
before. They reached it in safety, lifted the
window; the mother listened, took the child, bade
her husband adieu, and sank upon the bed in the
solitude of disconsolate sorrow, while he
commenced his journey alone, towards the land
of freedom. He said to me, in the artless but
pious language of a confiding heart, as he
pointed upward, “I think the Father kept the child
still; don't you think so, Mr. Ward?” “Certainly,”
said I.</p>
            <p>Poor man! He never saw his wife again. He
died ere he received tidings of her. But those
two simple hearts, reciprocally confiding in each
other, and mutually trusting in their God, shall be
again united. Indeed, are <hi rend="italics">hearts</hi> ever
dissevered? However this may be, they shall be <hi rend="italics">one</hi> again
when they, and all those who oppressed them, shall
stand before a common judgment-seat!</p>

            <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
            <head>CANADIAN FREEMEN.</head>
            <p>IT but remains for me to speak of our people resident in Canada as freemen. Once more, let me remind the reader that slavery is the worst school
of vice in the universe. I am ashamed to plead so
much on this subject, bearing as it does the unpleasant
appearance of special pleading. I will just give my apology for it. When I go to Glasgow, Scotland, and see along Argyle Street, and
near the Tontine, and in High Street, specimens of
low, dirty, degraded population, I am told that the parentage, early education, and low origin, of these people, ought to be taken into the account, in making up my estimate of them. When I complain of
the beggary, the want of self-respect, which show themselves in Ireland, in every street and lane of every town, and at the doors of every country
tavern, many circumstances, some of them simply historical, others purely imaginary, are made answerable for all this, and I am reminded of past
condition and present improvement. So, when I
<pb id="ward190" n="190"/>
turn out of Fleet Street, the Strand, or Regent Street,
London, and express my disgust at what I find within a
stone's throw of those fashionable thoroughfares,
Englishmen point to the inadequate education of these
people, their deep poverty, their degrading and
constant toil, the long neglect of them by better
classes, and the very many gin shops to be found in
their midst.</p>
            <p>Now, the reasonableness and the force of all this I
most freely and cheerfully admit; but why does it not
apply with equal force and reasonableness to the case
of the formerly, lately, enslaved Negro? I hear him
censured as if he and his ancestors had been civilized,
evangelized, highly educated, and especially
favoured, for the past fifty generations. His faults are
set down to the viciousness of his nature. Mr. W.
Chambers, the London “Times,” everybody, English,
Scotch, or Irish, as well as Yankees, can find fault with
the Negro; but few will do him the justice to judge of
him, his faults, and his virtues, by the same rule that
they would apply to other classes, to their own class.
What I affirm <hi rend="italics">of</hi> the Canadian Negro is, that he bears
himself equal to English, Irish, Scotch, Dutch, or
French Canadians, although he <hi rend="italics">has</hi> and they have <hi rend="italics">not</hi>
been slaves; all I claim <hi rend="italics">for</hi> the Canadian Negro is, that
same fair rule and standard of character which is
applied to other peoples, and by
<pb id="ward191" n="191"/>
which they are estimated. Let us stand or fall by
such a rule, and I am content.</p>
            <p>As any one would judge, the mass of our population
are labourers. Some are most excellent
mechanics and artisans; others are farmers, yeomen.
Too many of them live in and about large
towns. That is always unwise in poor people, in
my judgment. In these towns they pursue the
means of livelihood common to other poor people,
and in what they do they are as expert and efficient
as any other class: in some things, I think, they
excel. A few in large towns are servants in hotels.
A small number of the same class are servants on
steamers. Exceedingly few of either sex, as
compared with the coloured people of the neighbouring
States, are household servants. This last fact, in
connection with another I am about to mention,
speaks well both for their independence and for
the degree of equality existing betwixt whites and
blacks in Canadian towns. There are a great
many, as compared with what one sees in the
States, engaged in other than menial or 
semi-menial employments—fewer barbers, bootblacks,
and more porters, carters, cabowners, &amp;c. Small
shopkeepers, also, are far more numerous, in
proportion to their relative numbers, in Canada than
in the States. Some of the grocers' shops, as well
as those of other tradesmen, are on a very respectable
<pb id="ward192" n="192"/>
scale, considering the wants of the populace;
many are equal to any in the colony.</p>
            <p>If any class excel, it is our mechanics and artisans.
We have the best and most clever of the Southern
population, white or black, in this respect, and they
add not a little to our stock of industrial wealth as a
colony. I know of no better builder in St. Catherine's
than a coloured man to whom I was introduced there,
in 1853. The best cordwainers in Middlesex and in
Kent respectively are Nelson Moss, of London, and
Cornelius Charity, of Chatham. James Madison Jones,
of Chatham, has not his superior as a gunsmith in
Canada, if indeed in North America. Charles Peyton
Lucas, in his trade as a general blacksmith, will
compare with any man in Toronto, where he resides;
but as a horse shoer, it is impossible for any man to
exceed him. Before he went to Canada, I knew him to
stand at the head of his trade in this respect. The most
skilful bricklayer in Toronto I ever saw, was a person
as black as myself, whose name I have not the
pleasure of knowing.</p>
            <p>We now have the good fortune to number among us
some gentlemen of education and property, who have
turned their back upon the States, and “who are not
mindful of the country from whence they came out.”
These are educating their children, and fitting them to
occupy any position which
<pb id="ward193" n="193"/>
Providence may call them to fill, as all posts of honour
and profit are as open to them as to any other class.
They now see many persons taking the positions for
which they are fitted, irrespective of complexional
distinction. That is an earnest of what they may enjoy,
as they shall be qualified for like situations and
honours. Indeed, Negro-hate cannot do them the
mischief it does in the States, for the reasons before
stated: it has not the sanction of our laws, the spirit of
our institutions, or the countenance of our better,
more fashionable, more powerful—in a word, our
ruling classes.</p>
            <p>I shall now briefly detail what I have seen in the
settlements of the blacks, in Canada. I must express,
however, my regret that I have not had the pleasure of
visiting two of them—one situated in the township of
Oro, county of Simcoe, seventy miles from Toronto,
and another in Peel, county of Wellington, about the
same distance from Hamilton. The Wilberforce
Settlement, in Middlesex, near London, has become
extinct, having proved, from some cause, a failure.</p>
            <p>In 1840 a farm was purchased in the township
of Dawn, now Gore of Camden, in the county of
Kent, by several gentlemen under the guidance of
Rev. Hiram Wilson, for the purpose of establishing
a Manual Labour School. Around this nucleus
have gathered several coloured families. It was
<pb id="ward194" n="194"/>
<hi rend="italics">then</hi> an unbroken, undisturbed forest; <hi rend="italics">now,</hi> some of
the best farms, approached by as good roads as have
been made in Canada, are in that settlement. There are
about 150 families in the neighbourhood, among whom
resides George Cary, Esq.—as intelligent and
enterprising a man, as fit for a magistrate or any other
like office, as any person in North Kent. Here lives,
too, quite at his ease, in a large farm comprising
several hundred acres of most excellent land, the
gentlemanly, noble-hearted Dennis Hill, Esq., one of
the best educated yeomen in Canada. Peter Johnson,
now living independently on his ample property, was
an ordinary labourer fifteen years ago, carrying a bag
of meal fourteen miles through the forest, on foot.
Now, persons come to him from the surrounding
towns, to make purchases. Over the same road that he
travelled fifteen years ago on foot, with his bag of
corn meal as the result of a week's work, he now drives
his well fed horses to market, with large supplies. In
this neighbourhood, one of the earliest and most
prosperous settlers, beginning with nothing, mutilated
by his brutal master while a slave, coming to Canada
when he was forty year old, with a large family—now
reposing in comfort upon the produce of eighty acres
of as good land as Canada contains—is the honest, the
venerable, the beloved Josiah Henson—“Father
Henson,” as most persons affectionately call him.</p>
            <pb id="ward195" n="195"/>
            <p>The school to which I refer, in this settlement,
proved a failure. Like other failures, it involved all
connected with it in pecuniary loss, and rendered
them liable to a great deal of censure. Of the merits of
the matter one can scarcely judge, from the
<sic>criminations</sic> and recriminations of contending parties.
I am sorry to say, that when I visited the settlements,
in 1852, neither the school, nor the buildings, nor the
farm, reflected the least possible credit upon any party
concerned. I fear that little or nothing has been done
since, to improve the affair. It is in the hands of certain
gentlemen of great eminence in London, but why
nothing is done I know not.</p>
            <p>That the settlement should succeed so well
without the school, and by the unaided and energetic
efforts of the settlers, many of whom were once
slaves, all of them from the Southern States, with an
exception or two, does them the highest credit.  It will
not be long before that part of Kent and the southern
part of the county of Lambton, adjoining it, will be in
the hands of coloured men, chiefly. Most of the
whites in the neighbourhood are very respectable
persons, treating their coloured neighbours as
neighbours ought; some few are among the most
indescribably offensive wretches I ever saw. They
have no claim to sense, manners, morals, character,
reputation, nor anything else than what, for them,
supplies the
<pb id="ward196" n="196"/>
lack of all these—a skin which, when clean (as
fortunately it is occasionally), if not submitted to too
rigid an examination, would, among folks not very
discriminating, pass for white, or at least approaching
white, though rather dingy. The Sydenham River,
which empties into Lake St. Clair, runs through this
settlement. It is so deep, though narrow, that steamers
and schooners can come to the wharf load and
discharge. Thus the Dawn settlement is brought
within water communication of Detroit, the metropolis
of the neighbouring State of Michigan. The outlay of
a little capital, the continuance of such energy as has
brought the settlement to its present state, and the yet
further increase of that energy (for which there is
ample occasion and encouragement in the resources
of the country), will make the “Dawn,” as it is called, a
very flourishing town not many years hence.</p>
            <p>At the risk of giving offence, as I may perhaps by
my freedom, I will here record my opinion as to one of
the most lamentable defects I found while visiting
“Dawn.” It is, the general, almost universal, want of
energy and enterprise among the young people. It is
really painful to see the sons and daughters of fathers
and mothers who dared the perils of flight—defied the
discomforts of what an ornament to Canadian society,
perhaps the most
<pb id="ward197" n="197"/>
attractive of Canadian authoresses,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref11" n="11" rend="sc" target="note11">*</ref><note id="note11" n="11" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref11"><p>* Mrs. Moody.</p></note> calls “Roughing
it in the Bush”—partaking so little of the traits of their
parents' character, as to suffer such appearances to
strike the eye and wound the heart, as their neglect
makes but too apparent to the most casual observer.
Much of the lands <hi rend="italics">professedly</hi> tilled in that settlement,
if <hi rend="italics">really</hi> tilled, would bring twofold, fourfold, more
abundant crops; while the plough and the axe, the
scythe and the cradle, should do much, very much,
more, out of doors—the needle and its accompaniments,
within. I know I am liable to be reminded that such are
not <hi rend="italics">my affairs.</hi> In a certain sense, that is quite true. I do not
own a square inch of land there; I am not personally
affected by any of the evils to which I refer. But when
I see what is done on the farms of Messrs. Carey,
Johnson, Hill, and others, I cannot but deplore that
several persons, whom I refrain from naming, do not
profit from such business energy as these gentlemen
display, especially as they have the advantage of their
good example.</p>
            <p>Besides, I write as a black man. I write no more than
I have publicly said, in speaking on the subject, in
Canada. I have a right to complain. “I do well to be
angry” with any black man who throws discredit upon
our people. I denounce any son of a black man who
dishonours his father and
<pb id="ward198" n="198"/>
mother—breaking the fifth commandment—by
neglecting to improve what they, at the expense of
great toil and sacrifice, have earned for him. In this
sense, these young gentry are doing what it is my
business to speak of; and were my children to walk in
the same negligent way, he who would rebuke them I
should hail as a friend. Some poet says,
<q direct="unspecified"><lg><l>“Boys will anticipate,</l><l>Lavish and dissipate,</l><l>All that your busy pate</l><l>Hoarded with care:</l></lg><lg><l>And, in their foolishness,</l><l>Passion, and mulishness,</l><l>Charge you with churlishness,</l><l>Spurning your prayer.”</l></lg></q></p>
            <p>I fear more than one of the sturdy settlers of “Dawn”
have such “boys,” and, alas! girls too. Such
things, in <hi rend="italics">that</hi> settlement, are incapable of justification
or apology. But, with this one drawback, I think any
one who visits it will call “the Dawn” a very
successful settlement. It speaks well for the energy,
perseverance, and economy of the settlers. It shows
that the old pro-slavery story, that the Negro can only
work well when under a taskmaster—or that he is a poor
weakly creature, unfit for any position lacking the
sterner virtues of our nature—is quite consistent with
other falsehoods told against him. No one knows how
false such assertions are, so well as the slaveholder.
Does not the slave at his feet endure all manner of
<pb id="ward199" n="199"/>
sufferings and privations from the hands of his
master? Are not the slaves of the South the mechanics
and artisans thereof? Does not the slaveholder, when
offering a slave (especially if the latter be his OWN
CHILD) for sale, boast of these qualities, by way of
obtaining a larger price for him? When bought, is not
a high price paid for the slave because of his
possessing these qualities? As one of the many good
results growing out of the residence of 40,000
fugitives in Canada, I hail the refutation of this
calumny. As one of the many facts which practically
demonstrate the falsity of the disparaging remarks
concerning the Negro, made by his enemies, I hail
“the Dawn” settlement, its present success and its
prospective prosperity.</p>
            <p>I know not that I shall “travel beyond the record” in
speaking of Chatham as a settlement. It certainly
contains a large proportion—some say, and I think
correctly, one third—of coloured people, and most of
them live in a portion of the town which might not
unjustly be called a coloured village; and, that I may
make a remark or two, applicable alike to this and to
other towns wherein our people live in districts by
themselves, I will introduce to the reader Chatham as a
settlement. If as a rural district “the Dawn” is
prosperous, so is Chatham as a town. About one third
<pb id="ward200" n="200"/>
of the town plot is owned by black men. Here they
have two coloured Churches—one a Baptist, presided
over by Rev. Mr. Hawkins, son-in-law of the late Rev.
Benjamin Paul; and a Methodist Church, supplied
according to the itinerant system. The cottages, and
the buildings of a more pretending character, in the
vicinity, are of creditable size, and, though quite
destitute of architectural grace or beauty, compare
most favourably with what one generally finds in
young villages in the West. Their gardens are not
filled with ornamental exotics, but, like the gardens of
their paler neighbours, they contain most of the
substantial comforts generally grown in village
gardens. Greater neatness, and more general good
morals, are not to be found in the settlements of any
class in the colony, as a rule. The industry and
enterprise of the majority of the settlers are most
commendable. They are peculiarly fortunate in the
mechanics and artisans. The three best blacksmiths in
Central Kent are the three coloured blacksmiths of
Chatham. Mr. Thomas Bell, a builder of that town,
makes his work so speak for itself that his hands are
always full. If he lives to the ordinary age of man, he
will have the proud satisfaction of knowing that no
small portion of Chatham was of his own building. He
is destined to make and to leave his mark
<pb id="ward201" n="201"/>
on the town of his adoption. I was delighted to see,
too, that when he desires to employ bricklayers,
plasterers, joiners, or other mechanics, he finds expert
and skilful ones at hand, among our own people. I
have already spoken of Mr. Charity and Mr. Jones, of
this town.</p>
            <p>And yet, there is not a town in Canada, in which
the feeling against Negroes is stronger than in
Chatham. Most of the white settlers in Chatham were
low, degraded persons, in early and former life. They
are the Negro-haters. The more gentlemanly, as is true
almost everywhere, treat blacks according to their
character and position. There are some excessively
lazy, idle black persons in Chatham—they are a positive
disgrace to the class; but they have their equals
among the whites. There are two distinct classes,
distinguishable according to character, among the
one as well as the other. Some very clever travellers
pass through Chatham exercising only the faculty of
seeing the low, degraded Negroes, and the more
respectable whites. Somehow or other, their vision
does not extend so far as to see any low, dirty,
drunken whites, nor any respectable Negroes; and
when they speak of Chatham and its inhabitants they
speak according to what they saw—but that was only
what they <hi rend="italics">chose</hi> to see. Happily for the blacks of
Chatham, they are
<pb id="ward202" n="202"/>
known and appreciated by all whose good opinion is
worth having, or whose bad opinion is worth
dreading. As to the others, no matter about them or
their opinions.</p>
            <p>A steamer, belonging to a firm in Chatham, plies
betwixt that and other ports, down the Thames to
Windsor and to Detroit. No coloured person is
allowed a cabin passage on board this steamer. What
is needed is, that some wealthy and respectable
person of colour should give the owners of the boat a
chance of testing the validity of their rule by British
law. That opportunity doubtless they will have, before
they shall be many years older, in their offences
against their coloured fellow subjects. I regret that I
cannot recollect the names of these owners: I should
like to hold them up to infamy. The class of rebels to
which they belong would, if they could, rob us of all
our British rights and privileges; but, to the praise of
our Heavenly Father be it spoken, there is a limit to
their power.</p>
            <p>I first visited Chatham in 1852, in August. I was
simply passing through it on my way further west.
Though personally a stranger to everyone in the
place, I had not been long there before a requisition,
in due form, but in terms much too flattering, was
presented to me by Mr. J. C. Brown, one of the most
active of the coloured men of the county, desiring me
to speak to them that evening. Though
<pb id="ward203" n="203"/>
I had not intended to remain so long, I could not
very well refuse, and therefore consented. A numerous
auditory, convened upon a few hours' notice,
greeted me; and they both listened kindly to what
I said, and contributed most liberally to the funds
of the Canadian Anti-Slavery Society, whose agent
I was. My next visit was but six months afterward,
when I was struck with the noticeable progress
my people had everywhere made during the
time intervening. That I was cheered and encouraged
by this agreeable fact, I hardly need say.
At that time, too, though at mid-winter, their
voluntary contribution, following so soon upon the
former one, gave me a most welcome surprise.</p>
            <p>Chatham is emphatically the point of <hi rend="italics">entrée</hi> into
Western Canada. Before the railway was opened, it
was, from its position on the Thames, conveniently
reached by steamers from Detroit. It was then almost
exclusively <hi rend="italics">the gate</hi> to the Western interior. Hence
fugitives from the South-Western Slave States, and
free coloured people from Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Michigan, and other North-Western States, are almost
daily arriving there. This is one circumstance which
draws to it a large black population; and being already
the residence of so many, makes it attractive to still
more. Besides, it lies midway, or nearly so, between
Dawn on the north and Buxton on the south, the
<pb id="ward204" n="204"/>
two principal rural settlements of our people in the
colony. Those therefore who desire to settle in a
town, or those wishing to go to either of these two
farming districts, usually land at Chatham.</p>
            <p>There are fugitives—no, free persons—in that town
whose history would form a most enchanting romance.
I can scarcely deny myself the pleasure of presenting
some of them; but I must forbear. Suffice it to say, that
there are persons here who have escaped from their
own parents—some of them as white as the whitest
Europeans; others who ran away from the men by
whom they were treated, in some respects, as wives—
escaping with the children which were the fruits of
those connections. Some of these, having been
favourite slaves, were allowed some accomplishments,
and are therefore well skilled in music, drawing, &amp;c. 
Their appearance and demeanour but too plainly
show, that the system from which they escaped
includes some of the most debasing immoralities in the
whites, quite equal to what it forces upon the blacks.
What a sunken community must that be, in which men
belonging to the Church can beget children contrary to
the seventh commandment, without needing to blush!
What a religion must that be, which declares that the
system, of which these deeds are part, is ordained,
sanctioned, owned and blest, of God! And, apart from
all
<pb id="ward205" n="205"/>
moral and religious considerations, how wretchedly
depraved, how unnatural in his feelings, how near the
level of the lowest heathen—not to say, of the brutes
that perish—must be that man who complacently sells
the children of his own body! Ah! the slaveholders
are publishing, as in so many legibly written volumes,
in the faces of their mulatto offspring, the sad,
sickening evidences of their abominable immoralities.
As a tree is known by its fruits, so is slavery by this,
one of its most common results.</p>
            <p>Now let me suggest where fault may be found with
one or two things.</p>
            <p>1. I do not agree with the policy of coloured people
settling themselves together, in a particular part of a
town or village. Some of their white neighbours need
to be taught even the first ideas of civilization, by
being near to enlightened progressive coloured
people, such as are not few in Canada. And where
there are no legal difficulties in the way, as there are
not in Canada, there is no reason why we should not
buy, build, live, die, and be buried, just where other of
Her Majesty's subjects live.</p>
            <p>2. I have just the same to say about coloured
Churches. The day was, in the United States, to their
everlasting disgrace, when the whites so maltreated
the blacks, in their places of worship, that
<pb id="ward206" n="206"/>
the latter could not be comfortable in the same
congregations with them. Being subject to a universal
odium, and having no legal <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">locus standi,</foreign></hi> there was no
other way at that time apparent, but to worship
separately from the whites. Thus have grown up
coloured congregations in the States, until they have
become, both from custom and from the circumstance
alluded to, <hi rend="italics">almost</hi>—I must be excused from saying,
<hi rend="italics">quite</hi>—matters of necessity, in those States. However,
we were shut up to such poor ignorant teachings as
our own preachers alone could give us, and our
ignorance was greatly perpetuated thereby. True, this
fact furnished occasion for the exhibition of one of
the most remarkable facts in the history of any
oppressed people. I refer to their discovering such a
thirst for knowledge, in the midst of the greatest
discouragements, as to compel their preachers to give
them better instructions. Now, many of them compare
very favourably in education with white preachers;
and as <hi rend="italics">honest</hi> expositors of God's holy Word, they by
illimitable odds excel them. They never use the Bible
to justify any of their sins. I do regard this as one of
the most remarkable facts in the history and progress
of the Negro race. I regret exceedingly, that the great
lights of our generation have not brought this fact out
in bolder relief. In this fact the black people of
America
<pb id="ward207" n="207"/>
show greater advancement than any other oppressed
people, than any unenlightened class of any people
not oppressed, in the world.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref12" n="12" rend="sc" target="note12">*</ref></p>
            <note id="note12" n="12" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref12">
              <p>* It is true that the coloured preachers are many of them ignorant men;
but it is also true, that this ignorance is so felt and complained of by a great
many of their hearers, that they have been compelled to acquire education. Is not this a very creditable fact?</p>
            </note>
            <p>But we of Canada are in far different circumstances;
and even such results as above referred to, in a
country like ours, may be purchased at too dear a rate.
In Canada we are not on trial as to whether we shall
have our rights: we have them. We cannot afford to be
confined to the ignorant teaching of our poor
brethren, just from the plantations, because other and
better teachings are at our service. We cannot afford
to wait for the success of such slow steps as have
brought about the improvement of our people in the
States, for we must <hi rend="italics">now,</hi> without delay, fit ourselves
and our children for the responsibilities of free British
citizens—responsibilities which are already ours,
whether we be fit for them or not. I beg, therefore, to
record here my opinion, as far as it may have weight,
against all and singular of the Negro Churches, not
only of Chatham, but throughout British America. I
speak the more freely from having uttered the same
sentiments to those concerned, who were kind
enough to hear me patiently, and who, I know, would
be the last to
<pb id="ward208" n="208"/>
suspect me of anything else than the most fraternal
feeling for them personally.</p>
            <p>3. I must be allowed to express my regret that some
of the black men of Chatham—men, too, of wealth and
position, as compared with many others, white and
black—are wanting in <hi rend="italics">manliness.</hi> They do not bravely,
manfully, stand up for themselves and their people as
they should. They cower before the brawling
demagogue Larwill—a man well known as an enemy of
the Negro, but a man beneath any manly Negro's
contempt—a recreant Englishman, of low origin but
aspiring tendencies, not knowing his place, and
consequently not keeping it. He has some little
property, some coarse vulgar talent, which, with a
good degree of dogged boldness, makes him—
especially as his principles are of most convenient
changeableness—popular with his class. It was he who
moved, as an appendix to the vote ratifying Lord
Elgin's Reciprocity Treaty, a provision against
fugitives entering Canada except under onerous
Negro-catching conditions. He avowed his object to
be, to please the slaveholders of America. English
readers will pardon me for obtruding so unworthy a
man upon their notice; but I am sure they will at the
same time approve my scolding black men for cringing
to him, much more for voting for him, when a
candidate for office.</p>
            <pb id="ward209" n="209"/>
            <p>I say, this man and all like him should be taught that
the self-respect of every black man, imperatively
forbids his having anything to do with them; much
less seeking their favour, by anything like fawning
upon them. But there are noble blacks there, who will
never do anything of the sort. Take it all in all,
Chatham, as a settlement, is most successful; its
influence upon our cause cannot but be most
healthful. Take them all in all, the coloured people of
Chatham are an honour to the race of Ham.</p>
            <p>In the town of London (which, I beg to inform the
reader, is on the Thames, in the county of Middlesex;
its principal church is St. Paul's; it has a Blackfriars and
a Westminster Bridge; the town immediately west of it
is Westminster) there are some coloured families and
individuals who are not only equal, but superior, to
many of the inhabitants, of whatever colour. Here, our
people do not live so much in distinct districts as in
Chatham and some other towns. Abel Bedford Jones
has his shop, his residence, and most of his town
property, in one of the best streets, in the centre of the
town. His brother, Alfred Thomas Jones, a druggist, is
in one of the best business positions in the town. The
same is true of others whom I could name. There is not
a town in Canada where the respectable coloured
people enjoy more of the esteem of
<pb id="ward210" n="210"/>
the best classes, than London. Here, too, the lower
classes are, according to their custom, Negro-haters.</p>
            <p>I cannot speak of London without recollecting the
lamented John Fraser, Esq., whose personal
acquaintance and whose very great kindness I had
the honour to enjoy, a year or two before that
deplorable accident which deprived him of life and
London of one of her most useful, most honoured
citizens. Standing in the first rank of London society,
Mr. Fraser was always ready to use his great name,
his commanding influence, his ample purse, and his
shining talents, in behalf of the poor—among others,
of my own people.</p>
            <p>I now come to one of the most gratifying parts of
my work. It is, to speak of the Buxton Settlement,
township of Raleigh, in the southern part of Kent. I
will not repeat what I have said elsewhere concerning
the early origin of this settlement. It seems that the
Rev. William King (one of the most single-minded,
straightforward, energetic and philanthropic
Scotchmen I ever knew) being, in the right of a relative—
perhaps his wife, I do not know exactly—a
slaveholder, and seeing the evil of it, determined to
free his slaves. In such a mind as his, it was natural
<hi rend="italics">that</hi> thought should give rise to another; that was, to
settle them in a free country. Hence he brought them
to Canada for that purpose. But while settling these,
why not found a settlement
<pb id="ward211" n="211"/>
for other free coloured people? Why not purchase a
tract of land, and open it for any who might come?
And then, they would need some one to look after
them, guide them, teach them, and preach to them:
why should not <hi rend="italics">he</hi> undertake this? He did: and
immediately formed a Company, called the “Elgin
Association,” in honour of the then most excellent
Governor-General of Canada; raised money, bought
lands, settled his own freed men, invited others,
founded a colony, opened a school; and, having been
appointed a missionary by his own (the Free Scotch)
denomination, he organized a Church, formed a
Sabbath School, and is going on most successfully
with the settlement of Buxton.</p>
            <p>There are about 150 families in the settlement.
It is now about six years old. Each family purchases 
fifty acres of land, paying ten shillings
sterling the acre. To accommodate their circumstances,
the land is sold to them for the price the
Association gave for it. The payments are divided
into ten of equal amount; and upon making the
first payment, the settler enters upon his land.
Certain moral qualifications must be possessed to
fit one for an opportunity of purchasing. This
wise rule is adopted for the purpose of securing to
the community none but persons of good character.
As a result, I did not learn of one immoral person,
among the 150 families. No drunkard—and,
<pb id="ward212" n="212"/>
indeed, no person who uses alcohol as a beverage—is
among the whole mass of those settlers.</p>
            <p>They commenced when the whole tract was an
unbroken forest. They now have comfortable houses,
of the primitive description; clearings growing more
and more extensive, good crops, a fair proportion of
stock, and as many signs of present comfort and
future prosperity as any settlement of the same age in
Canada. I am now speaking merely of their physical
circumstances, the best feature of which is their genial
cheerfulness. This is the more remarkable, as some of
them never lived on farms, much less on new bush
farms, before. Some of them are immediately from large
towns, where their occupations were any other than
would fit them for such residences; some were from
the far South, where they never felt the rigours of
such winters as we have in Canada: but these are as
cheerful as any others. I was there, the first time, in the
summer; my next visit was in the middle of the winter.
On both occasions I had the pleasure of seeing with
what peculiar satisfaction they enjoyed and imparted
the fruits of their own toil, the products of their own
labour.</p>
            <p>In the higher matter of intellectual manhood, these
Buxtonians are making most commendable progress.
Mr. King has established a school that
<pb id="ward213" n="213"/>
would compare well with most of the grammar schools
in the country. In it are taught the ordinary English
branches, and Latin as well. Two of the most
proficient pupils are a boy and a girl formerly Mr.
King's slaves. So much more efficient is the school
than those of the Government in the neighbourhood,
that the latter are abandoned, and the whites of the
vicinity gladly avail themselves of the superior
advantages this school offers them. Hence, white
children and black children sit, recite, and play
together, without distinction. Hence, also, in the
Sunday-school, are some white and some coloured
teachers; and some of the one race are teaching those
of the other, and <hi rend="italics">vice versâ,</hi> in the different classes. So
also the Negro and the white man worship and
commune together, a coloured lad setting the tunes. In
the winter a night school for adults is taught. I have
seen a mother and her two sons in the school during
the day; and I have seen men, who worked hard at
woodcutting all day, spend their hours, after walking
by torchlight through the forest for miles, in the
evening school. Aye, I have seen the same mother
who was a day scholar take her place among the
evening scholars, as well. Indeed, the young men and
young women generally spend the winter in acquiring
education; it is their chief, chosen pastime. Persons
whom I knew to be
<pb id="ward214" n="214"/>
careless about it in the States, are anxious and
persevering to learn, now that they live in Buxton.</p>
            <p>The fact of the physical and the intellectual
development of the settlers, along with their
high-toned moral character, already makes that
settlement a model one. <hi rend="italics">There</hi> is a living refutation of
all that is said against us. It is not a matter of
speculation, it is a matter of history. It is not
something about which learned men may differ
touching the ancient Negro; it is fact concerning the
modern Negro, the Negro of the nineteenth century. It
is not a question about what the Negro is capable of;
it is an undeniable truth in demonstration of what he
has done and is doing. The best country tavern in
Kent is kept by Mr. West, at Buxton. Mr. T. Stringer is
one of the most enterprising tradesmen in the county,
and he is a Buxtonian, a coloured man. I broke my
carriage near there. The woodwork, as well as the iron,
was broken. I am particular about such things; so I am
about the shoeing of my horses: but I never had better
repairing done to either the woodwork or the ironwork
of my carriage, I never had better shoeing than was
done to my horses, in Buxton, in February 1852, by a
black man, a native of Kentucky—in a word, the work
was done after the manner of Charles Peyton Lucas.
They are blest with able mechanics, good farmers,
enterprising men,
<pb id="ward215" n="215"/>
and women worthy of them; and they are training the
rising generation to principles, such as will give them
the best places in the esteem and the service of their
countrymen at some day not far distant.</p>
            <p>But I know of no community (I have travelled all
over the United Kingdom) where stricter, better
attention is paid to religion, than in Buxton. The whole
population attend church. Their attention
—their deep, serious interest—their intelligent love of
the gospel—their decent, dignified demeanour—their
freedom from gaudiness in dress, their neatness of
person, and, best of all, the lives they exhibit in daily
transactions—render them a most agreeable
congregation, either to worship with or to address. I
speak from experience, having had the pleasure of
both.</p>
            <p>When Mr. King proposed this settlement, such a
hue and cry was raised against it! The Mr. Larwill
before spoken of headed a petition against allowing
Mr. King to purchase the land. They said that
“nobody would live near a Negro settlement. Land
would become good for nothing in the
neighbourhood. The Negroes would never cut down
the trees and clear the land. They would be constantly
committing depredations. In short, they knew the
whole thing would prove a failure; at least they hoped
it would.” They even
<pb id="ward216" n="216"/>
went so far as to threaten to pull down the Negroes'
houses, if they should have the temerity to build upon
the land, when purchased for them and sold to them.
Mr. King, armed with the warrant from Her Majesty's
representative to that effect, purchased the land, and,
not having the fear of man before his eyes, settled his
family upon his own farm, in the neighbourhood. The
first purchaser was a strong-minded, bold, courageous
black man, a native of Tennessee. He purchased a
farm, erected his cabin, and on one Saturday removed
his little family into his house. On Sunday, according
to the fashion of the times <hi rend="italics">then,</hi> a number of ill-featured, wild-visaged, unwashed, unshaven, 
scape-gallows-looking fellows, were out shooting, and came
to the house of Mr. Riley, this Negro. He was near his
door when they approached. Coming up to him, one of
them, a wolfish-looking customer, said gruffly, “Haint
you heard that if any of you niggers built a house
here, we would pull it down?”</p>
            <p>Putting himself into a defiant attitude, Riley replied,
“Yes, I have heard so; and if <hi rend="italics">you</hi> are here to pull my
house down, <hi rend="italics">I</hi> am here to see you do it.”</p>
            <p>That was the last of that threat. Now, these persons
are not only content to live near their coloured
neighbours, but they like it: now, no shooting is done
on Sunday, in that part of the township. Such is the
moral influence of the
<pb id="ward217" n="217"/>
settlement and its excellent minister. <sic corr="sentence fragment">Land sells all the
higher because in that neighbourhood.</sic> These blacks
are spoken of as good customers, good neighbours,
good farmers, &amp;c. Two farms were offered me, in the
neighbourhood, by white persons. They asked round
prices for them. I complained. “But you see, sir, they
are so close to the King Settlement. First-rate
neighbours, good customers, good preaching, <hi rend="italics">tallest
kind</hi> of a school; do you see?” I saw. (The preceding
is the Western method of setting forth all manner of
advantages in one breath.) Thus has that little
community lived down more falsehoods than even its
enemies ever told about it; and I hesitate not at all to
say, that no subjects of the British Crown reflect more
honour upon the liberty, the equality, the institutions,
of Canada, than do the inhabitants of Buxton.</p>
            <p>These settlements all happen to be in Kent. There
are others, some of the most densely populated, in the
county of Essex. They are flourishing in a high degree,
but my limits will not allow of my mentioning them in
detail. Dawn represents fairly, I think, the average
condition of the three before mentioned; what I say of
Chatham applies to towns in which we live generally;
and Buxton is both a model for other settlements, and
a proof of what can be done by judicious right-minded
men.</p>
            <pb id="ward218" n="218"/>
            <p>In conclusion, I beg to say that I do not think that
exclusive settlements for coloured people are to be
considered desirable. Experiments have been made;
they have proved triumphantly successful: now we
need no more of them. In a country like Canada, whose
population must of necessity become more or less
mixed, the maintaining of distinct nationalities is
certainly exceptionable. Anything exclusive, except so
far as education and morals go (and perhaps, in future
days, rank and wealth, provided they be open alike to
all), is certainly unwise and unfair. After all, you can
better teach by intermingling than isolation, to those
who deny the Negro's capacity, what he can do. It is
by constant, every-day contact with the Negro, that
his character—his faults as well as his virtues—can be
learned; and if anything in the way of settling is to be
done, it were far better to do it by fusion than by any
exclusive plan or scheme. I think just the same of
French settlements, or Dutch, or Irish, or any other.</p>
            <p>However this particular point may be viewed, I think
no one can look at the black population of Canada,
with its great energy, increasing intelligence,
moderately but certainly increasing wealth, skilful
industry, high moral character, aspiring aims, and great
loyalty (as was shown in time of the rebellion, and will
be again, whenever needed),
<pb id="ward219" n="219"/>
increasing numbers and in all respects growing
importance, without agreeing with me, that a most
important future is before them. The attraction of
freedom, spite of fugitive laws and bloodhounds, will
draw them to us from the Slaveholding States. Those
who are residing in the North, and feel alarmed, will
come to us. Thousands of others, who were never
slaves, will join us—as many have during the past year
or two. Can the South afford the drain of her most
energetic men, the very lifeblood of the country, year
after year? Can the traducers of the Negro refute the
fact—so contradictory to their assertion, as having come
from Dr. Bacon twenty years ago, and from
Ex-Governor Hunt but the other day, “that blacks and
whites cannot live together on amicable terms as
equals in the same community”? Here is a
demonstration, a <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">quod erat demonstrandum,</foreign></hi> to the utter
confusion of that oft repeated untruth. It is not far off,
it is right at their very doors. If we point to our West
India Islands, they have two refuges to fly to: 1, The
superior number of the Negroes—as if that altered the
case! 2, The ruin that emancipation is said to have
wrought. But here is no preponderance of blacks; no
ruin, especially no ruin in the settlements and villages
of the blacks. If they point to Hamilton, or some other
town where immorality among coloured persons
<pb id="ward220" n="220"/>
is but too common, it can be most triumphantly
replied, that there are no women of bolder lewder
character, no men who give more trouble to the
magistracy, in that and like towns, than the low whites
thereof; and while Negro degradation is, I am sorry to
say, too apparent there, some of the most enterprising,
and in every way most honourable, men of that town
and vicinity, are coloured men.</p>
            <p>And if the South cannot afford the draft upon her
population which her oppression drives and our
freedom draws, what can she do to help it? What can
the North do? Talk of annexation or conquest! Why,
when there were but a handful of inhabitants in
Western Canada, the invaders were driven out. “Yes,
but York was burnt!” So was Detroit! The rebellion
gave intermeddlers a “taste of our quality,” as
Negroes; and there are more of us now. But
annexation would not dispose, and could not compel,
a single Negro to return to the South: it would,
however, if the extradition were attempted, drench the
soil of Canada with blood, for we should resist quite
as firmly as we resisted British bayonets, when we
fought for Yankee liberty in both wars, and there are
yet some living who recollect how that was done. But
since the passing of the Fugitive Law, Canadians who
were once foolish enough to be friendly to annexation
see so clearly what American freedom is (or is <hi rend="italics">not</hi>) for
<pb id="ward221" n="221"/>
both white and black—they see how perfectly the
whole Union is chained to the car of slavery (and not
helplessly, but cringingly, basely, because willingly
dragged at its wheels)—that they prefer real British
freedom to the specious, despotic, misnamed Yankee
substitute.</p>
            <p>To the silent but powerful operation of those
causes, therefore, must our neighbours submit, while
the onward progress of the Canadian Negro shall
exhibit the workings of American despotism, and
British freedom, in their opposite results, before the
eyes of an overlooking world.</p>
            <p>The cause of the free coloured man in the States,
and of the British American Negro, is one. On both
sides of the line that cause is in the hands of those
most concerned. May they work in harmony; may the
work prove successful! May each of us, in his sphere,
do his part! And may God give the victory, and to him
be the glory!</p>
            <p>I have given what I deem the truth, concerning the
character of the slaves who come to Canada. I have
also spoken of what I have ventured to call “the
improving process” of their flight. Some facts have
been presented, touching their progress, their skill in
their employments, their general industry, and the
prosperity of their settlements. I beg to add, more
definitely than heretofore, a
<pb id="ward222" n="222"/>
statement of what is, to me, one of the most gratifying
facts connected with our population: I refer to the
very high standard of morals among them.</p>
            <p>From my long residence and extensive travels in the
United States, I may, I think, claim to be pretty well
acquainted with the moral and religious character of
my people. I am free to say that, from the ample
opportunities afforded me of judging, the coloured
people of Canada, as a whole, are the most moral and
upright of our race in America. I am aware that in the
States, North and South, they compare well with their
pale-faced neighbours. I believe that the fair and the
impartial will admit, that while in property and
education the Negro in the Republic is, from causes
beyond his control, inferior to the more favoured
class, in morals, in character he is not a jot or a tittle
beneath the best of his neighbours. Whether others
do or do not admit it, such is the fact.</p>
            <p>But I know of no community of coloured people, in
the States, where moral character is so pure as it is in
Toronto. There, the least breath of suspicion against
a person's moral character is the signal for his being
universally avoided. It matters not what be his wealth,
he is shunned and abandoned, if his character be
spotted. Former position, powerful friends, nothing,
can give him admission to society, if once a moral
stain be fixed
<pb id="ward223" n="223"/>
upon him. The consequence is, that persons who are
the least doubtful in this respect, find it impossible to
impose themselves upon society, while a greater
circumspection than I ever saw elsewhere is most
studiously observed by all. The good influence of this
state of things upon the young cannot be 
over-estimated. This, I know, is a point of great delicacy;
but it is one of so much importance, and of such great
credit to my people, that I am sure I should be wanting
in duty and faithfulness if I did not mention it.</p>
            <p>What I say of Toronto, where the largest coloured
population is, applies equally well to London and to
all other towns which I have visited. It is but true, that
to this rule there are some unfortunate exceptions;
some towns have larger proportions of the immoral
class than others: but what I have just said is true of
our people in Canada as a rule.</p>
            <p>I know of cases in which persons not the most
circumspect before they removed to Canada have
come amongst us, and have put on such behaviour
and exhibited such morality as they never did when
residing in the States. I have known others, who
passed current in the States, who thought to be
admitted into society among us as they were at home,
without amendment. They were most wretchedly
disappointed. They were obliged to
<pb id="ward224" n="224"/>
associate only with those of their own low level. In
other instances, I have known of persons saying, “We
are free and equal here. Our manhood is recognized,
and we must live up to our responsibilities.” The
freedom of my adopted country works as an antidote
to the moral poisons of the slavery and the prejudice
of my native country. While the latter degrades, the
former elevates.
<q direct="unspecified"><lg><l>“The day</l><l>That makes a man a slave takes half his worth away.”</l></lg></q>
The day that makes him a freeman, if it does not
restore “half the worth taken away” by slavery,
restores a part of it.</p>
            <p>That this very important population may go on
improving, and, by improving, reflect honour upon our
race and justify the institutions under which it is their
blessing and privilege to live, is, I am sure, a wish in
which all benevolent hearts, on both sides of the
Atlantic, will join me. I know of no better method of
rebuking, practically and powerfully, the attitude and
the conduct of our American neighbours, for their evil
treatment of the slave and the free coloured man, than
the improvement and development of the British
Negro; and I beg to repeat, that what is done in this
direction is practical co-operation with the
abolitionists of the States in their laudable work.
Success to the work, on both sides of the line!</p>

            <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
            <head>VOYAGE, ARRIVAL, ETC.</head>
            <p>AFTER I had travelled in the service of the
Anti-Slavery Society of Canada from December 1851
until April 1853, they desired to take advantage of the
well known anti-slavery feeling of Great Britain,
quickened and intensified as that feeling had recently
become by the unprecedented influence of Mrs.
Stowe's masterpiece, “UNCLE TOM'S CABIN,” by
sending me to England, to plead in their behalf, and in
behalf of my crushed countrymen in America, and the
freed men of Canada. Accordingly, I took the good
steamer “Europa” on the 18th of April, 1853 (having
bid adieu to Toronto, and the precious ones within it,
the day before), for my first voyage across the
Atlantic. This voyage was, to me, one of no ordinary
interest. It was my first departure from my native
continent. I was on my way to a strange land,
thousands of miles from family, friends, relatives,
<pb id="ward228" n="228"/>
or any one who cared for me. I confess to no little
nervousness on this account.</p>
            <p>Then, I had scarcely gone on board before a fact
occurred that did nothing to increase my mental
comfort. And, while I am about it, I may as well state
two facts of like character. The first is, that Lewis
Tappan, Esq., in procuring a passage for me, had, with
his characteristic straightforward manliness, told the
agents that I was a black man. For this I was grateful:
it saved me much inconvenience. They sold Mr. T. a
ticket upon the back of which was the following
indorsement:—“This gentleman's passage is taken with the
distinct understanding that he shall have his meals in
his state room.—E. C.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref13" n="13" rend="sc" target="note13">*</ref><note id="note13" n="13" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref13"><p>* The initials of Mr. Edward Cunard.</p></note> Mr. Tappan, both as my
personal friend and as a Christian man, remonstrated;
but it was of no avail. As if this were not enough, so
soon almost as I touched the deck of the ship, a fine
gentlemanly-appearing <hi rend="italics">Englishman</hi> accosted me—</p>
            <p>“Mr. Ward, I believe?”</p>
            <p>“The same.”</p>
            <p>“You are going out to Liverpool?”</p>
            <p>“I am.”</p>
            <p>“When Mr. Tappan took your passage, I was
obliged to say to him, that you would take your meals
in your state room; for you know, Mr. Ward,
<pb id="ward229" n="229"/>
what are the prevalent feelings in this country in
respect to coloured people, and if you eat at the cabin
table Americans will complain. We cannot allow our
ship to be the arena of constant quarrels on this
subject; we avoid the difficulty by making the rule
that coloured passengers shall eat in their state
rooms, or we can't take them.”</p>
            <p>I replied, “I desire, Mr. Cunard, to be in London by
the 4th of May. If I wait for another steamer, I shall be
too late. For that reason I <hi rend="italics">submit</hi> to that to which, I
wish you to understand, I do not <hi rend="italics">consent.”</hi></p>
            <p>“I am an Englishman,” said Mr. C.: “I entertain no
such feelings; but I must see to the comfort of the
passengers. I will see that you have a comfortable
state room; and indeed, you shall have a room, if
possible, on deck, which will be more pleasant for
you; and the steward shall have directions to make
you as comfortable as possible; and I wish you a
pleasant voyage, sir.”</p>
            <p>Well, thought I, here is an Englishman perverted,
according to his own showing—like the Yankee, making
the dollar come before right, law, or anything. He does
not “share” Yankee feeling—he only accommodates,
panders to it! that is all! His passengers must be made
“comfortable”; that is, if they be white. If not, why,
the ship must not be “an arena for public
discussion,” &amp;c.!</p>
            <pb id="ward230" n="230"/>
            <p>This was not exactly sea sickness, but no one will
be surprised that it did not add to the pleasantness of
going to sea. I could not but reflect upon the
arrogance of the Americans. They are for freedom, but
they must enforce their own views of matters upon
other people. They believe in equality; but it must not
be exhibited, even in a British ship, in a form different
from their way of showing it. In a word, the arrogance
of Yankees amounts to this—“Wherever we go, and
over whomsoever we meet, <hi rend="italics">our</hi> peculiar views, feelings
and customs, shall be made the supreme rule.” Worse,
however, than Yankee arrogance, is the easy
accommodating virtue of a Yankeefied Englishman.</p>
            <p>The other fact came to my knowledge soon after. It
seems that the second steward, having some
“flesh in his heart,” and seeing that, with one or two
exceptions, the second-cabin passengers (of which
class I was) were Englishmen, proposed that I should
be invited to join my fellow passengers at the table. All
agreed <hi rend="italics">but one,</hi> and that one was a small-sized
Welshman! He had been to Texas, forgotten his Welsh
breeding, become a slave-holder and a Negro-hater,
and his pro-slavery spoiled dignity couldn't endure my
black presence at table. I knew that no passenger, nor
even the owners, could legally deny me my right to
enter
<pb id="ward231" n="231"/>
the second cabin. I knew that I had submitted to quite
enough, in allowing them to put me into a superior
state room, abaft the wheels, 20 feet further aft than
second-cabin passengers are allowed to go, as a
compromise with Negro-hate. Now, to be kept out of
the cabin by a little fellow about “four feet nothing
and a half” tall, was quite too much. I therefore entered
the cabin when I pleased, defiant of my <hi rend="italics">little friend,</hi>
who, I am bound to say, became quite civilized in a few
days; so much so, that ere we parted, he invited me to
a small entertainment, in that very second cabin within
which he could not at first endure my presence. What
an ever-present demon the spirit of Negro-hate is!
How it haunts, tempts, wounds, the black man,
wherever his arch-enemy, the American, goes!</p>
            <p>In Mr. Cunard's case, in its likeness to and
connection with those of many other Englishmen, of
such character, I found occasion for serious reflection,
that has driven me to a conclusion which shall
hereafter control my life. It is a conclusion to which my
excellent friend, Mr. J. N. Still, of Brooklyn, came long
since. I never really differed from him, but I confess
that not until I came to Europe did I see it in its full
importance. Mr. Cunard is a man of business; so are
the mass of Englishmen. What interferes with or
threatens a
<pb id="ward232" n="232"/>
diminution of the gains of business must be avoided.
What is right or wrong, if not set aside altogether,
must at least be merged in or be made subservient to
business considerations. What is peculiar to an
Englishman's feelings, what is accordant with the spirit
of British law, what is included with a British subject's
rights, in my case, must all give way to the mere
question of business: <hi rend="italics">i. e.,</hi> Yankees pay largely, as
passengers on the Cunard line. True, there are three
Yankee lines competing with it; and it is equally true,
that the rights of a black subject are as sacred in the
eye of the law as those of a white subject (though
Yankees are not subjects, by the way); so it was true,
that what were my rights on British soil were my rights
in a British ship. It was also true, that Her Majesty's
Government retained so much control over that line as
to have the power, when necessary—as has since been
done—to send half the vessels comprising it to the
Baltic, in the transport service. It was equally true,
too, that if any one made a disturbance on board of
the “Europa,” <hi rend="italics">that</hi> was the person to be deprived of
his rights, and not an innocent person; besides, in my
case, the matter was prejudged, and I was made to feel
the weight of the regulation, in advance of any
disturbance arising from my presence. But, pshaw!
This is simply the right and the law of the case. It
must be viewed,
<pb id="ward233" n="233"/>
Mr. Cunard thought, in a business light. Yankees are
frequent customers; Negroes are not. Now, could not
the thing so be managed as to retain the £50,000
given by the Government for carrying the mails, retain
the patronage of the Yankees, and, if some few
Negroes occasionally go on the steamers, partly
conciliate them and partly sacrifice them? That is the
<hi rend="italics">business</hi> view of the matter—that is the view of Mr.
Cunard; and I am sorry to say, about ninety-nine out
of every hundred Englishmen in America view such
matters in the same light. What is a Negro made for,
but to be kicked about for a white man's convenience?</p>
            <p>Then I saw, that the <hi rend="italics">chief,</hi> almost the <hi rend="italics">only</hi> business
of the Negro, is to be a man of business. Let him be
planter, merchant, anything by which he may make his
impression as a business man. Let a fair
representation of us be found, not in servile and
menial positions, but in business walks—on 'change, in
Lombard Street, at the Docks, anywhere; but let it be
in active prosperous business life. Let us become of
some value as customers; then, when such devoted
men of business as Mr. Cunard have before them the
question of treading under foot some Negro, they will
conclude differently. They will say, “Yes, it is true he
is black, and our taste is like yours, gentlemen—a taste
wonderfully improved by living with
<pb id="ward234" n="234"/>
you under the ‘stripes and stars’ of republican freedom
and equality; but then, looking at the matter with an
eye to business, the fact is, we cannot very well afford
to lose the custom of this class.” Yes; black men must
seek wealth. We have men of learning, men of
professional celebrity, men who can wield the pen,
men of the pulpit and the forum, but we must have men
of wealth; and he who does most to promote his own
and his neighbour's weal in this regard, does most to
promote the interests of the race.</p>
            <p>Could we speak of wealthy blacks as we fortunately
can of Robert Morris and Macon Bolden Allen, of
Boston, as lawyers; James McCune Smith, of New
York, and John V. Degrasse, of Boston, and Thomas
Joiner White, of Brooklyn, as medical men; Charles L.
Reason, William G. Allen, and George B. Vashon, as
college professors; James William Charles Pennington,
William Douglass, William Paul Quinn, Daniel A.
Payne, Alexander Crummell, Henry Highland Garnet,
Amos Gerry Beeman, and William H. Bishop, as
divines; James M. Whitfield and Miss Watkins, as
poets; Frederic Douglass, William Howard Day, John J.
Gains, Charles Mercer Langston, and William J.
Watkins, as orators—we should be looked upon and
treated in altogether a different manner. But as we have
produced such
<pb id="ward235" n="235"/>
men as I have named—or rather, as they have, under
God, <hi rend="italics">produced themselves</hi>—so let us hope and be
assured that the day is not far distant when, like the
Quakers and the Jews, we shall be well and widely
known for the pecuniary prosperity and independence
of our class.</p>
            <p>With the exception of the two annoyances referred
to, I had a most delightful voyage, and became a most
capital sailor—that is, in the passenger's sense of the
term, which simply is, to be able <hi rend="italics">to do nothing,</hi>
comfortably and perseveringly, without sea sickness. I
eat, drank, and slept, well—great comforts, at sea. I had
the honour of daily visits from the excellent physician
of the vessel, whose acquaintanceship I have the
pleasure of still enjoying. Mr. W. M. Thackeray did me
the honour to spend an hour daily in my state room.
He, too, still honours me with his friendly
acquaintance. The Lord Bishop of Montreal called
upon me, the day after our first Sunday. Perhaps his
Lordship was looking after me as a stray sheep, for I
did not attend the service conducted by him on the
day before. The service was in the after-cabin. I was
not a passenger in that cabin. I was partly proscribed,
because of my colour, to accommodate the
passengers. To be a fellow worshipper with them, on
sufferance, was more than my self-respect would
allow. I therefore remained in my state room,
<pb id="ward236" n="236"/>
where, I trust, I found and worshipped the
omnipresent, the impartial Jehovah. For the kindness
shown me, as well as for the manner of showing it, by
the gentlemen referred to, I shall ever be grateful.
There were several Americans on board, not one of
whom came to me. Of course I did not seek them.</p>
            <p>On Saturday, the last day of April, we saw land
on the coast of Ireland. We then moved gracefully
along the coast of Wales, telegraphed our approach
at Holyhead, took a pilot early on Sunday morning,
and, at eleven o'clock precisely, anchored
in the Mersey, after a passage of ten days, fifteen
hours, and fifteen minutes, mean time. I was in
England—the England of my former reading, and
my ardent admiration. I was at Liverpool—that
Liverpool whose merchants, but sixty years before,
had mobbed Clarkson for prying into and exposing
the secret inhumanities of their slave trade. I was
in a land of freedom, of true equality. I did not
feel as some blacks say they felt, upon landing—
that I was, for the first time in my life, a man.
No, I always felt that; however wronged, maltreated,
outraged—still, a man. Indeed, the very
bitterness of what I had suffered at home consisted
chiefly in the consciousness I always carried with
me of being an equal man to any of those who
trampled upon me.</p>
            <p>My first experience of English dealing was in
<pb id="ward237" n="237"/>
being charged treble fare by a Liverpool cabman, a
race with which I have had much to do since. Acting
upon the advice given me by John Laidlaw, Esq., I
went to Clayton Square, where I found good quarters
at Mr. Brown's very genteel Temperance Hotel. The
Rev. Dr. Willis had very kindly given me a note of
introduction to the master of the Grecian Hotel; but I
found no reason to desire a change, and therefore
remained, while in Liverpool, where I first lodged.</p>
            <p>Several things arrested my attention upon the
first day of my being in England. One was, the
comfort and cleanliness, not to say the elegance of
appearance, presented by the working classes. I
had always, in the United States, heard and read
of the English working classes as being ground
down to the very earth—as being far worse in their
condition than the American slaves. Their circumstances,
in the rural and the factory districts, I
had always heard described as the most destitute.
That they wrought for sixpence a day I had been
informed by I know not how many Americans,
who had visited England. How many times have
I heard from the lips of American protectionists,
and seen in the columns of their journals,
statements such as this—“If we do not maintain a
protection tariff, English manufacturers, who pay
their operatives but sixpence a day, will flood our
<pb id="ward238" n="238"/>
markets with their products, and the factory operative
in America will, in consequence, be compelled to
work for sixpence a day, as the English operative now
does”! When I was an American protectionist, how I
used to “take up that parable,” and, believing it, repeat
it! How others with me believed the same too often
told falsehood! Here was before me, in Lancashire and
her noble port—Lancashire, the head quarters of British,
if not European, factory interest—almost a
manufacturing kingdom in itself—a most abundant
refutation of what, on this subject, I had nearly a
thousand times heard, read, believed, and repeated.</p>
            <p>But this was Sunday. The next day, having occasion
to cross the Mersey, I saw nearly as many well-dressed
working men, with their wives and
sweethearts, enjoying the holiday of that Monday, as I
had seen the day before. This led me, as I travelled
further into the factory district, to make definite
inquiries into the condition of the operatives; and, as I
may not again recur to it, I will put down here, in few
words, a sort of summary of the information I obtained.
I learned—indeed, saw with my own eyes—that
throughout Lancashire the young women in the
factories dress as well as the young women I had seen
at Lowell, Dover, Manchester, Nashua, and other
manufacturing towns in New England. I had been in
<pb id="ward239" n="239"/>
those towns but a year and a half before; and now, at
Manchester, Bolton, Preston, Wigan, &amp;c., had a fair
opportunity of comparing them. I learned as well, that
the wages of the different grades of operatives varied
from highest to lowest, each respectively being about
the same as in New England. The hours of labour were
not greater; and upon visiting several factories (among
them that of Sir Elkanah Armitage, at Pendleton,
Manchester), I found the work as easy, and the health
and cheerfulness of the operatives as good, as I had
seen in the same class on the other side of the
Atlantic. What was true, comparing the English with
the American <hi rend="italics">female</hi> operative, is equally true of the
<hi rend="italics">male.</hi> I was agreeably surprised to learn that the
condition of these people, as I had heard of it at home,
was a misrepresentation of the condition in which I
found them. Formerly, the operatives had suffered
much from the want of care exercised by themselves,
and more from the want of humanity on the part of
their employers; like some persons of other business,
of whom we have been speaking, humanity was made
to succumb to business: but, by the perseverance of
Lord Shaftesbury (then Lord Ashley) and others,
Government exerted an influence between the
employer and the employed, and led to the adoption of
many very important improvements.</p>
            <pb id="ward240" n="240"/>
            <p>Here were two truths which the pro-slavery portion
of the Americans did not at all like to tell, and therefore
cleverly and conveniently forgot them: 1, That the
improvements referred to do exist. 2, That the British
Parliament shows an interest in behalf of these people,
who “are worse off than our slaves.” It better suits
their purpose to state matters as they <hi rend="italics">were,</hi> than as
they <hi rend="italics">are;</hi> and to state the truth, that the Government
of Great Britain, through its legislature, looks after
these people, would <hi rend="italics">rather</hi> spoil the parallel between
the British free labourer and the American slave! It is a
clever thing to <hi rend="italics">forget</hi> just what one chooses <hi rend="italics">not to
recollect!</hi></p>
            <p>Another thing that attracted my attention was, the
beautiful twilight of this latitude. Forgetting that I was
eleven degrees further north than ever before, I
wondered why at eight o'clock it was so light. I then
learned how to join Englishmen in the enjoyment of
that most delightful part of the day. But when I went
to Scotland, subsequently, I was still more charmed,
especially at midsummer, in the far north, with this
pleasing feature of a northern residence.</p>
            <p>I wondered, also, that I could not realize the vast
distance I had come, and the mighty space between
me and those loved ones I had left behind. I seemed to
be simply in a neighbouring town,
<pb id="ward241" n="241"/>
when in Liverpool. I could see in this town, and in the
appearance of many of its inhabitants, some
resemblance to Boston and the Bostonians. Nothing
wore, to my view, the strange aspect which I had
expected. This, I think, was owing partly to my having
travelled so much before, constantly visiting strange
places and constantly seeing new faces;
partly to the strong resemblance of
the New England people to those of Liverpool; but,
more than either, to the fact that in Canada, especially
in Toronto, we are English in habits, manners, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I beg to add, too, that I could not have anticipated
how much my faith would be strengthened, by trusting
in God amid the exposures of a voyage. Faith grew
stronger by its own exercise. For nine consecutive
nights I had lain my head upon my pillow at sea. In the
midst of the vast deep, where our great vessel and all it
contained might, like the “President,” go to the
bottom in an hour, leaving none to tell the story of our
fate, and no traces of even the whereabouts of our
destruction—to trust God in these circumstances—to
hear the rolling heaving ocean, at deep dark midnight,
and still to trust him—to listen to the hurried commands,
and the rattling of ropes and sails, and the hundred
and one accompaniments of a storm, and still to trust
him—give faith a strength peculiar only to its trial amid
dangers. I could not
<pb id="ward242" n="242"/>
help writing to Mrs. Ward, that, having long before
learned to trust our Heavenly Father as the
God of the land, I had now learned to rely upon
him as the God of the ocean. I know not how
far this accords with the experience of other voyagers,
and have now no means of knowing whether
the same feeling will continue with myself;
but I do know that it at present is far from being
one of the least striking or the least pleasing
incidents of my first voyage.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
            <head>COMMENCEMENT OF LABOUR IN ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>THE object of my coming to England has been stated.
So soon as I began to speak of it, I found persons
responding to it most readily. After presenting my
letters at Liverpool, I took the train for London, for the
purpose of meeting the great leaders of England's
unrivalled benevolent movements, during the May
Meetings. Finding most agreeable travelling
companions, and seeing England in her first of May
dress, to my very great delight, I reached London at
about four p.m., in the midst of a pouring rain.
Unfavourable as was the day for seeing London, yet
London has some things, many things, innumerable
things, to show, on any day. Here, I was much more
impressed with my being a stranger than at Liverpool.
There was no such thing as learning my way. There
was neither rational beginning nor ending to the
streets. They were so tortuous, that, starting in one of
them in a certain direction, I soon found myself going
in the opposite direction in the same street! Still,
<pb id="ward244" n="244"/>
even London can be learned, with all its intricacies;
and after a while I became, in this respect, a Londoner.</p>
            <p>Delivering my letters to the persons to whom kind
friends had commended me, and finding myself
expected at the Anti-Slavery Office, I set about the
<hi rend="italics">work</hi> of attending the May Meetings. I am sure people
must have been amused with my exceedingly
awkward, backwoods appearance. A backwoodsman
in London is sure to be conspicuous. The more he
tries to hide the fact that he is such, the more apparent
he makes it. But I adopted the easiest, quietest
mannerism I could command, and confessed myself a
mere colonist, asking no one to take me for more than I
was, while I cared not how much they underrated me.</p>
            <p>Exeter Hall I had often heard of, and went there the
first thing after my arrival. A meeting was in progress—
with speeches, cheering, passing resolutions, and all
that sort of thing, to which I was not an entire
stranger. A large fine-looking person was in the chair.
I took a seat near to a most affable gentleman; and
wishing to know who the chairman was, I wrote on a
card and handed it to my neighbour, “Who is the
gentleman in the chair?” “The Marquis of
Cholmondeley,” was his reply, on another card. I had
seen a nobleman, a lord—for the first time!</p>
            <pb id="ward245" n="245"/>
            <p>The Rev. Thomas Binney, to whom I brought letters
from Rev. Mr. Roaf, my pastor, received me most
kindly. Mrs. Binney acted as if we had been
acquainted for the preceding six-and-twenty years;
and, being the first London lady with whom I had the
pleasure of acquaintance, I saw in her what I have
since seen in English people of all ranks, who are
really genteel—a most skilful and yet an
indescribably easy way of making one feel perfectly at
case with them. I cannot tell how it is done. I saw it in
all good English society, but how they did it I know
not; at any rate, they are most successful in making
one feel it. I think a part of it is, in being perfectly at
ease themselves; and another part is, the perfectly
captivating kindness that is seen in all they say and
do. In this respect, really genteel people, of all ranks,
are perfectly alike; in this you cannot distinguish a
nobleman from a commoner: but the most ridiculous
blunders are made by those assuming it to whom it is
not habitual, natural, or educational.</p>
            <p>My first introduction to any portion of the British
public was at the meeting of the Colonial Missionary
Society, on the evening of its anniversary, at Poultry
Chapel. To the Rev. Thomas James, its excellent
Secretary, I had brought letters. On their presentation,
this gentleman, as a sort of “Minister for the Colonies,”
took me by the hand
<pb id="ward246" n="246"/>
most warmly. At his invitation I attended the meeting
in question. The Rev. Mr. Binney kindly introduced
me, in a manner which, I fear, my effort did not at all
justify. At that meeting the Lord Mayor Challis
presided. I had never before seen a Lord Mayor. His
Lordship kindly invited me to the Mansion House, in
company with several ministers of the Congregational
denomination, a few days after. About the same time
the meeting of the Congregational Union occurred,
and I was formally introduced to the body by the
Secretary, Rev. George Smith, in company with Rev.
Charles Beecher, whom I had not met before. Then
came a dinner for the ministers and delegates at
Radley's Hotel, at which I was called upon for a
speech.</p>
            <p>The amiable Rev. James Sherman, at that time
minister of Surrey Chapel, with his accustomed
kindness took me in his carriage to the dinner; and
afterwards, for four months, not only made me his
guest, but made his house my home. I never lived so
long with any other person, on the same terms. While
I live, that dear gentleman will seem to me as a most
generous fatherly friend.</p>
            <p>It was at his home, the best place to study a man's
character, that I learned who James Sherman is, and
how and why to appreciate him. If I love him more
than some persons do, while all admire him and
multitudes love him, it is because
<pb id="ward247" n="247"/>
I know him better and am more indebted to him. His is
not the friendship of the passing hour; it is not that
which only smiles when everybody else does, and
deserts one in the hour of trial and need; it is not the
friendship which easily exhausts itself in a few courtly,
complimentary phrases, and common-place, costless,
worthless because heartless, flatteries. The friendship
of James Sherman is that of a man of feeling, as well as
a man of honour; it is that which places at one's
disposal whatever he has, whatever he can do, and
rejoices in any sacrifice to accommodate whoever may
have the good fortune to be admitted to his intimate
acquaintance. Since the demise of my dear father, I
have seen no man whom, in adversity and prosperity,
in sunshine and in storm, I could so safely trust, in
whom I could so implicitly rely in any and all the
varying and trying circumstances of life and fortune,
as James Sherman. This, I know, is no honour to one
so exalted, from one so humble. But gratitude and
affection, it seems to me, are not out of place here; and
I wish to convey to the friends of the Negro on the
other side of the Atlantic, what they have a right to
receive, my deep and humble though ardent sense of
obligation to that gentleman, both in my own behalf
and in behalf of my people.</p>
            <p>Once introduced to their meetings, kind brethren
<pb id="ward248" n="248"/>
found enough for me to do, Sunday and every other
day, until the meetings were over, and I had formed a
list of acquaintances well worthy of my crossing the
Atlantic. Having served several other causes, it
became time to launch my own, especially as I had not
dragged it upon other people's platforms.</p>
            <p>I had arrived in England at a fortunate time—not
merely because of the May meetings, but because of
the twofold fact that “Uncle Tom's Cabin” was in
every body's hands and heart, and its gifted authoress
was the English people's guest. For anti-slavery
purposes, a more favourable time could not have been
chosen for visiting England. I may be allowed to dwell
upon this for a moment. The book came in the very
best time, as if by an ordination of Divine Providence.
A year before, the expected invasion of England by
the French absorbed so much attention, that it could
not have been so patiently and attentively read, nor
could it have made so deep an impression; a year after,
the war with Russia engrossed universal attention: but
the issue of that work during a sort of lull in public
affairs, between these two events, was most
opportune. I regard it, I repeat, as a special ordination
of Providence.</p>
            <p>“Uncle Tom's Cabin” had so impressed the
<pb id="ward249" n="249"/>
anti-slavery people of the aristocratic classes, as to
lead to the celebrated address of English women to
the women of America, in behalf of the enslaved.  
This, with its powerful effect, was the theme of
universal discussion when Mrs. Stowe arrived in
England. The book from the one side of the Atlantic,
the address from the other side, and the arrival of her
whose gifted pen had been the occasion of the one
and the origin of the other, awakened more attention
to the anti-slavery cause in England, in 1853, than had
existed since the agitation of the emancipation
question in 1832. It was my singularly good fortune to
meet Mrs. Stowe at the house of Rev. James Sherman,
in May; indeed, we were dwellers under his hospitable
roof, along with Rev. Dr. Stowe and Rev. C. Beecher,
for some three weeks.</p>
            <p>By the advice of Rev. T. James, I invited several
friends of the anti-slavery cause to a meeting at
Radley's Hotel, on the 7th of June, to lay before them
the objects of my mission. Having been honoured
with the acquaintance of Lord Shaftesbury, I ventured
to ask him to take the chair on that occasion; to which,
with his Lordship's ordinary kindness, he consented.
The meeting, approving of my objects, adjourned to
Freemasons' Tavern, on the 21st. In the meantime,
Lord Shaftesbury kindly procured for me the names of
<pb id="ward250" n="250"/>
the following noblemen to attach to the call for that
meeting: the Duke of Argyll, the Earl of Harrowby, the
Earl Waldegrave, and Lord Brougham. Mr. Sherman
procured for me the names of Sir James K.
Shuttleworth, Mr. Sheriff Croll, and Messrs. Bevan and
Tritton the bankers. On the 21st the meeting was held,
the Earl of Shaftesbury in the chair: and a Committee
was formed, of which that distinguished nobleman
consented to be Chairman; Rev. J. Sherman, and S. H.
Horman-Fisher, Esq.,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref14" n="14" rend="sc" target="note14">*</ref><note id="note14" n="14" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref14"><p>* A most devoted friend of the Negro, and a gentleman who honours me
with his personal friendship, tested in hours of trial and darkness.</p></note> Honorary Secretaries; and G.
W. Alexander, Esq., Treasurer.</p>
            <p>Thus, in a manner neither anticipated by myself nor
by those who sent me to England, was my cause
launched, so to speak, upon the broad sea of public
British munificence, under such auspices and with
such a prestige as favour the missions of but few
colonists coming to this country, on any errand
whatever. Deep and lasting are the obligations under
which I was laid. I never <hi rend="italics">shall</hi> forget those obligations;
I never <hi rend="italics">can</hi> cancel them. It is to me a great relief, in
view of my own unworthiness of them, to know that
they had infinitely less to do with me than with my
people; and that, however unfortunate the latter were
in the selection of their representative, they themselves
<pb id="ward251" n="251"/>
are far more worthy of the distinguished
consideration they received through him. I may be
permitted to add, I have the satisfaction of knowing
that the Anti-Slavery Society of Canada, who sent me
here, have, on more occasions than one, testified their
high appreciation of and cordial fraternal thanks for
the manner in which the distinguished personages
who contributed to our cause, and gave it the sanction
of their great names, and laboured in its Secretariat and
upon its Committee, served and forwarded the
objects of my mission.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref15" n="15" rend="sc" target="note15">*</ref></p>
            <note id="note15" n="15" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref15">
              <p>* The noble Earl of Shaftesbury had made his honoured name
fragrant among all the lovers of freedom on the other side of the
Atlantic, before this. His Lordship is now revered in every cabin in
Canada.</p>
            </note>
            <p>As I was under no engagement to labour for the
Committee on Sunday, I accepted of an offer kindly
made me by the Committee of the Colonial Missionary
Society, through its excellent Secretary, Rev. Thomas
James, to urge the claims of that very important
charity, on the first day of the week. Thus the field of
my labours and circle of my acquaintance were
enlarged greatly; and as my appearance anywhere, as I
understood the matter, brought the <hi rend="italics">slave</hi> to mind, I
hope that, in that service, I did not mar the great chief
object of my coming hither. Occasionally, too, I was
honoured by invitations to speak for the London
Missionary Society; while kindred charities, along
<pb id="ward252" n="252"/>
with these, seemed to regard me as public property;
and, ere I knew it, I had the name of a respectable
successful beggar. The duty of travelling in these
causes called me into almost every county in England,
into the pulpits of the most distinguished Dissenting
divines in the land, into company with some of
England's noblest sons and daughters, into contact
with representatives of the different classes of 
pro-slavery men in England, whether exotics or natives—in
a word, into a sphere of active usefulness which I had
before never dared to covet.</p>
            <p>It is, as it should be, in America and in the colonies,
regarded as a matter of importance, for a man wishing
to improve both his head and his heart, to visit
England. There is so much to be learned here,
civilization being at its very summit—society, in
consequence, presenting every attraction, and every
form of social improvement and instruction. Here, too,
is so much of historic recollection. England, indeed, is
a book, ancient, mediæval, and modern, in itself. One
cannot but agree with those who hold the opinion that
the best specimens of the Colonial or the American
gentleman need European travel for their finishing.
English travel, in more ways than one, is the best,
choicest portion of European travel. I came to England
knowing this, and hoping to enjoy and
<pb id="ward253" n="253"/>
appreciate it in some degree; but to be associated with
that band who have no equals in this world and no
superiors in any age, the leaders of the benevolent
schemes of England—to be acknowledged by them as
a coadjutor—to be permitted to share with them in those
smaller, lighter portions of their work, for which alone I
had any sort of even seeming qualifications—was what I
had no right to expect, but what I felt the honour of all
the more. Before I had been one month in England, I
had been upon the platforms of the Bible, Tract,
Sunday School, Missionary, Temperance, and Peace,
as well as the Anti-Slavery, Societies. To the last, in my
native country, Negroes are freely admitted, invited, as
a matter of course. Who ever saw one of sable hue
upon the platforms of <hi rend="italics">the others?</hi> Never, as an equal
brother man, was I welcomed to the national platforms
of any of them, until I became a resident of Canada.</p>
            <p>After ten months' service for the Anti-Slavery
Society of Canada, through the Committee in London,
its affairs were wound up, some £1,200 having been
kindly given to its treasury by the philanthropists of
England and Scotland. A large meeting was holden at
Crosby Hall on the 20th of March, 1854, the
venerable and philanthropic Samuel Gurney, Esq., in
the chair; Rev. James Sherman, Samuel Horman
Horman-Fisher, Esq.,
<pb id="ward254" n="254"/>
L. A. Chamerovzow, Esq., Rev. James Hamilton, D.D.,
Rev. John Macfarlane, B.A., Josiah Conder, Esq.,
together with others, being on the platform; and
Joseph Payne, Esq., gracing the occasion with his
presence, a speech, and a piece of poetry, the last of
which he kindly gave me. I hold it as a memento of its
beloved author, and as a remembrance of the
friendship wherewith he has been pleased to honour
me.</p>
            <p>I shall not, I am sure, be expected to give the dry
details of a journal, nor a formal account of the
meetings I attended, much less the speeches I made—if
speeches they deserve to be called. Nor, I hope, shall I
be considered wanting in gratitude (a charge brought
against too many Americans, with but too much
justice, it is to be feared), if I do not mention the name
of every town in which I received kindness, and every
family and every individual to whom I am indebted.
The reason why I shall not do so is simply this: this
book must have an end. Where that end would be,
were all those recorded, it were impossible for author,
publisher, or printer to say; but I am very sure no
reader would have patience to seek it by consecutive
reading.</p>
            <p>Several incidents—some of the principles I sought
to promulgate—a few reflections upon what I saw,
heard, and felt—with the mention of some names,
<pb id="ward255" n="255"/>
which must be taken as representatives of all their
class—I shall give: this, I am convinced, is all that
can be expected of me. As my time and labours were
not exclusively devoted to anti-slavery advocacy, <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">in
formâ,</foreign></hi> my remarks will not be restricted to that subject.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
            <head>PRO-SLAVERY MEN IN ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>ON a former page I spoke of “pro-slavery men in
England, whether natives or exotics.” There is no use
in concealing that there are such, of both classes. The
latter do not always choose to be called pro-slavery
men; but that is their position, nevertheless. For
example: the Rev. Dr. Cox would like, in England, to
pass for the friend of the slave; but at home he is a
justifier of slavery. The Rev. Dr. Baird can lecture
eloquently about the oppressions the Hungarians
suffer at the hands of the Austrians: his lips are
sealed, his tongue is dumb, on the oppressions of
American slavery. The Rev. Dr. Anderson can inveigh
against “Englishmen's singling out slavery for rebuke,
passing by other sins:” at home, he has yet to treat it
<hi rend="italics">as a sin, for the first time.</hi> The Rev. S. J. Prime, D.D.,
likes well enough to be seen among British
abolitionists, but he scorns the company and the
principles of Christian abolitionists at home. His paper,
“The New York Observer,” with which I have been
acquainted, more or less, for twenty
<pb id="ward257" n="257"/>
years, is, without exception, the most persevering 
pro-slavery paper in the country in which it is published.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref16" n="16" rend="sc" target="note16">*</ref>
<note id="note16" n="16" rend="sc" anchored="yes" target="ref16"><p>* I cannot except even “Bennett's Herald,” or “Webb's Courier and
Inquirer”; no, not even the “Journal of Commerce.”</p></note>Such gentlemen, I repeat, come to this country anxious
enough to have an antislavery <hi rend="italics">reputation here;</hi> when,
like the Rev. Dr. Chickering, of Portland, Maine, they
have no antislavery <hi rend="italics">character at home.</hi> This is
certainly the most dangerous, and perhaps the most
numerous, class of exotic pro-slavery men. I did not
meet any of them personally, but I had the pleasure of
seeing them writhe under the earnest, loving,
anti-slavery passages in the speech of the Hon. and
Rev. Baptist Wriothesley Noel, at Exeter Hall; and I
saw how they looked while the Rev. Thomas Binney,
upon the same occasion (the anniversary of the British
and Foreign Bible Society, to which the Bishop of Ohio
and the Rev. Dr. De Witt, both pro-slavery, were
American delegates), poured upon them his huge pity
for being “unable” to give the Bible to the slaves:
and, as I travelled about, I could every now and then
hear of their pro-slavery deliverances. Still they never
came out in the face of day and avowed themselves
what they are proved to be at home—the friends of
slavery, the enemies of anti-slavery, the revilers of the
Negro, the supporters of the Fugitive Law.</p>
            <pb id="ward258" n="258"/>
            <p>At times, however, in private circles, one would
meet a Spanish slaveholder, or a person who had been
a slaveholder in the British West Indies, who would
utter, in a very quiet way, denials of anti-slavery truth.
I will give a few instances of what I mean by native 
pro-slavery men, and by exotics.</p>
            <p>Among the former are such Englishmen as the
editors of the London “Times,” who did their utmost to
write down “Uncle Tom's Cabin”—who ridicule and
misrepresent the Negro—and, when respectfully asked
to publish a dozen lines in their defence,
contemptuously refuse to do so. Among such, also, is
a lawyer of London, who, when hearing of a movement
for the education of Negroes in the West Indies, wrote
a pamphlet against the movement—of which pamphlet I
had the inexpressible pleasure of hearing Lord Robert
Grosvenor say, that in all his life he never had seen so
many pages of letterpress contain such “an infinite
deal of nothing.” To the same class belongs a young
physician, who, in a pamphlet concerning Jamaica,
published a few weeks since, and which received a
favourable critique from the “Morning Advertiser,”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref17" n="17" rend="sc" target="note17">*</ref>
<note id="note17" n="17" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref17"><p>* I regret exceedingly that Mr. Grant should have given currency to so
ill-tempered and truthless a pamphlet.</p></note>says all manner of bitter things against the Negro. As
a specimen of this person's candour and
<pb id="ward259" n="259"/>
veracity, he says, “a nigger cannot speak English.”
One would almost think that the writer proved it to be
more difficult for himself to write truth <hi rend="italics">in any language,</hi>
than for “a nigger to speak English.” And lastly, to
this class I set down those Englishmen who, like Mr.
Baxter (successor of the late Joseph Hume in the
representation of the Montrose burghs), travel in
America, see slavery, and return with honied words in
its favour, to garnish their speeches and adorn their
books. I may be pardoned for sparing no more space
to them.</p>
            <p>Among the latter are to be included such colonists
as are always seeking to make it appear that prejudice
against Negroes is quite natural and unavoidable, and
that a Negro becoming anything else than a mere
“hewer of wood and drawer of water” is out of the
question. Belonging as I do to one of the humblest
classes of colonists, I cannot but feel ashamed of any
one from the distant dependencies of the Crown, who,
in spite of what Negroes are in the Colonies, can give
utterance to an assertion so utterly contradictory to
historical truth. I give a specimen of colonial 
pro-slavery obliquity.</p>
            <p>In June, 1853, the Rev. Mr. Dowding, a most
excellent clergyman of the Established Church,
favoured me with a most cordial invitation to attend a
meeting for the promotion of Negro education
<pb id="ward260" n="260"/>
in the West Indies, by the revival of Berkeley
College, in Bermuda. I was but too happy to comply.
At the time, I had not an inch of property in any part
of the West Indies, nor was it then among the most
distant of my intentions to go there to reside; but it
was enough for me to know that some of the most
exalted in the land, at the head of whom stood the
venerable and benevolent Primate, were determined
that to this population, along with freedom, education
should be given. The meeting was held in Willis's
Rooms; the Earl of Harrowby was in the chair. Among
the personages present were the Earl of Shaftesbury,
Lord Radstock, Lord Robert Grosvenor, Captain the
Honourable Joseph Denman, the Honourable Charles
Howard, the Rev. J. Hampden Gurney, the Rev. Dr.
Vaughan of Harrow, &amp;c.; there was also the
Honourable C. S. Haliburton, of Nova Scotia. One of
the speeches was made by this gentleman. In the
course of his remarks the learned Judge said, that
inasmuch as the Bishop of New Brunswick approved
the plan, and as he had the highest confidence in the
judgment of that right reverend Prelate, he felt pleasure
in giving it encouragement and wishing it success. But
he ridiculed the idea of a <hi rend="italics">college</hi> for Negroes. A school
of an ordinary sort would have met his approval, but a
college was generally
<pb id="ward261" n="261"/>
understood to be a place for the education of a
<hi rend="italics">gentleman</hi>—a gentleman, among that race, was entirely
out of the question. He was neither an Englishman
nor an American, having been born “along shore,” in
Nova Scotia: but he was free on that occasion to say,
that he shared in the prejudices generally entertained
by Americans in regard to Negroes; and could not
regard such feelings as unnatural or unjustifiable, but
as inevitable. The idea of mixing with Negroes was
naturally, to a white man, altogether and
unconquerably repulsive.</p>
            <p>I do not profess to give Judge Haliburton's words,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref18" n="18" rend="sc" target="note18">*</ref>
<note id="note18" n="18" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref18"><p>*  S. H. Horman-Fisher, Esq., was present, and so was J. Gurney Hoare,
Esq. I think either of those gentlemen will attest the general correctness of
my version of the speech.</p></note>but I think those who heard them will admit that I give
his ideas. He made another point, about the ruin of the
West India planters by emancipation, which showed
but too plainly that, to the heart's core, he was entirely
with and for slavery, and that it was next to impossible
to find a more malignant enemy to the Negro than the
Honourable C. S. Haliburton. There were present some
exceedingly genteel persons, whose embrowned
complexions told plainly enough that they were not
only West Indians, but that they shared African blood
with me, though in a far less degree.</p>
            <pb id="ward262" n="262"/>
            <p>We are sometimes amused, if not disgusted, by
vulgar persons trying to put on genteel manners, for
the sake of inducing the belief that they belong to
genteel classes, while their airs and assumptions
betray them. So Judge Haliburton, on the occasion
referred to, in speaking contemptuously of a class
whom his superiors on that platform were seeking to
benefit—by the very effort to demonstrate that the
Negro could not possibly be a gentleman, proved that,
of all things, he himself most needed the qualities of a
gentleman. Lord Harrowby, the chairman, had
commended the object; Lord Shaftesbury had spoken
of the object, and of Negroes (some of whom he
named) who, in his Lordship's opinion, had made and
merited a name. I dare not repeat what this
distinguished nobleman said. Now for Mr. Haliburton,
in such a presence, to give an implied, if not a direct,
contradiction to these noblemen, was far more
ungentlemanly than anything done by any coloured
person in that meeting.</p>
            <p>As Judge Haliburton is the representative of a
class, and as he is a man of some local popularity,
holding opinions in common with other accidentally
elevated men of low origin, I beg, without repeating
exactly what I was permitted to say on that occasion,
to make a remark or two on this matter.</p>
            <pb id="ward263" n="263"/>
            <p>1. It is to be hoped that Englishmen, especially
English noblemen, will not suppose that Mr. C. S.
Haliburton, the author of “Sam Slick” and some other
such productions, is a fair specimen of colonial judges,
nor of colonial feeling. His Honour only illustrates the
fact that, in the North American colonies in former
days, judges were made rather hastily, and of rather
singular materials. Such a personage as Mr. Justice
Draper, of Toronto, or Sir John Robinson, the Chief
Justice of Upper Canada, or Mr. Justice Jones, of
Bruntford, or the eminent Ex-Chief Justice Marshall, of
Nova Scotia (who devotes himself to the temperance
cause, at his own expense, in Canada), would neither
offend a platform of noblemen, nor show the <hi rend="italics">bravery</hi>
of attacking an absent prostrate people with
expressions of heartless approval of their sufferings,
and sympathy with their tormentors—for the plain
reason that each of these personages is incapable
both of the indecency and the inhumanity to do so.
Judge Haliburton is <hi rend="italics">not:</hi> his Honour is most
abundantly equal to any such task. Therein he differs,
I am proud to say, from colonial judges generally.</p>
            <p>2. Admitting that Judge Haliburton's speech (I mean
that part of it which was a wholesale disparagement of
the Negro; hoping to say something about the subject
matter of the other part
<pb id="ward264" n="264"/>
at some day, not long hence) may have been as
beautiful (doubtless it was, in his own eyes) as
Vulcan's wife, it was, at the same time, as false as that
unchaste daughter of Jove. Within six-and-thirty
hours' sail of Judge Haliburton's residence are the
cities of Portland and Boston. Five hours more would
bring him to New York; and four more, to Philadelphia.
The Rev. Mr. Dowding has published the names and
opinions of several distinguished coloured
<hi rend="italics">gentlemen,</hi> in the last-named of those cities, having
visited them; and Judge Haliburton could have
acquired information concerning them quite as easily:
indeed, one cannot believe that a man of letters,
wealth, and leisure, a man in a learned profession, did
not know of coloured gentlemen so near him as are
many in those cities, especially in Portland and
Boston.</p>
            <p>But Mr. Haliburton spoke as a British colonist.
Could he be ignorant of the names of the Honourable
Edward Jordan, the Honourable Richard Hill, and the
Honourable Peter Moncreif, of Jamaica? Could he fail
to know that those eminent personages had, like
himself, practised at the bar, worn the ermine, and
adorned the legislative hall? Lord Harrowby knew it;
why should not Judge Haliburton? An older lawyer,
and a far more eminent man, Sir Allan MacNab, of
Canada, told me he had seen with great pleasure these
and like gentlemen,
<pb id="ward265" n="265"/>
in the Jamaica Legislature. But Judge
Haliburton says, “the idea of a black gentleman is out
of the question!”</p>
            <p>What lamentable ignorance, to use no harsher term,
does such an assertion as Judge Haliburton's betray,
in respect to the historical Negro! Euclid had a black
face, woolly hair, thick lips, flat nose, and crooked
ankles. He was the father of geometry, but Judge
Haliburton had never heard of him, or he could not
have said that “the idea of a black gentleman is out of
the question.” One of the objects of Berkeley College
is to teach modern Negroes the science whereof the
Negro Euclid was father. To this Judge Haliburton
objected. To his learned vision, it was perfectly
absurd! Was Terence, the black poet, a gentleman?
Were Tertullian, Augustin, Origen (of whom
Archbishop Sharpe, the grandfather of Granville
Sharpe, speaks as “among the most extraordinary
lights of the Church of God”), gentlemen? But let me
not do injustice to Mr. Haliburton. I may not know
what his idea of a gentleman <hi rend="italics">is.</hi> Judging from his
appearance, his writings, the taste displayed in the
only speech I ever heard him make, the sort of
rudeness with which he treated his superiors on this
occasion, and the utter destitution of any semblance of
liberal feeling then and there shown by him, I am
tempted to believe that the standard of a gentleman,
<pb id="ward266" n="266"/>
holden by Judge Haliburton, is one according to
which it may be, after all, no discredit to the Negro
race if they do not produce many <hi rend="italics">such</hi> specimens.</p>
            <p>A word as to the naturalness and inevitable
necessity of Negro-hate: that word is, <hi rend="italics">“truthless.”</hi> In
proof of it, the language of every speaker on that
occasion, with the single exception of Mr. C. S.
Haliburton, in respect to the Negro, was most
abundant, most triumphant.</p>
            <p>3. I beg to say, that sometimes the unfortunately
disproportionate number of Negroes in prisons is
pointed out to me as evidence of the very great
criminality of my people. I ask any one to say, what
chance of a fair and just trial a Negro could have,
before such a judge as Mr. Justice Haliburton, when a
white man was prosecutor? (I happen to know how
Negroes have suffered in such cases.) For it is
impossible for a man, when he puts on his judicial
robe, to put on another nature: the man and the judge
will be very much the same. I know nothing of Judge
Haliburton's character, or rather of his history, in this
regard; but judging from his own words, and from the
likeness of feeling to himself on the part of his fellow
citizens, I do not at all wonder that the blacks of Nova
Scotia are deprived of many of their rights by them.</p>
            <p>The explanation of all this is, that Judge Haliburton,
<pb id="ward267" n="267"/>
and all like him, whether on Yankee or British
soil, do not wish to know better. A fair illustration of
the class was given me by G. Ralston, Esq., in the case
of an American lady who was at the Clarendon when
Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs
gave a complimentary dinner to his Excellency the
Honourable Benjamin Roberts, President of the
Republic of Liberia. President Roberts, it is known, is
an American by birth, and of African origin. Seeing—
and, though an American, so far above the
contemptible prejudices of his countrymen as to enable
me to say, with great pleasure, with delight—that
President Roberts was the “admired of all admirers,”
Mr. Ralston proposed to introduce his fair
countrywoman to the guest of England's noble
Secretary. With real American feeling, this proud
republican dame declined. So do all of the class. They
choose not to know coloured persons of distinction,
when they might; or, knowing them, they choose to
misrepresent them.</p>
            <p>I must be allowed to record, just here, the very great
delight I had in hearing the <hi rend="italics">real</hi> gentleman and
nobleman speak, at the meeting referred to, in such
terms as they were pleased to use, concerning the
Negro. Doubt of the Negro's capacity was scouted, as
a brainless, senseless thing. Rejoicing in such an
opportunity of forwarding such
<pb id="ward268" n="268"/>
a movement was common to all lips, as it flowed from
all hearts; but the expression which struck me with
greatest force was the one which conveyed the idea of
their indebtedness to the Negro. Upon this Lord
Harrowby and Lord Shaftesbury strongly insisted, and
the meeting received their words with marked
approbation. The Honourable Charles Howard,
brother of Lord Carlisle, and Lord Robert Grosvenor,
brother to the Marquis of Westminster, dwelt upon
this thought as if it were one to which they were no
stranger. The Honourable Captain Denman, brother to
the present Lord Denman, declared that “we had
sinned against the Negro in the West Indies; and while
he could not agree with Mr. Ward, that no evils had
followed emancipation, he did trace a natural
connection between those evils and the sins which
preceded them.” The Rev. J. Hampden Gurney, the
Rev. Dr. Vaughan, and all the other British <hi rend="italics">gentlemen</hi>
present, expressed like sentiments. I need not say, that
on my people's behalf I was but too proud of the
opportunity kindly afforded me, of thanking such
benefactors for such words. If any one should infer
that the author of “Sam Slick” appeared awkward and
out of place in such company, I am quite willing to
bear the responsibility of this inference.</p>
            <p>Leaving this meeting, and that member of it
<pb id="ward269" n="269"/>
upon whose words I felt myself called upon to say so
much, it may not be inappropriate to say some other
things, in this chapter, on this subject. It is not to be
denied that a history of the Negro race is unwritten;
no, it is written in characters of blood! It is a very
compact, succinct chronicle: it comprises but one
word and its cognate—<hi rend="italics">slavery, slave trade.</hi> There is the
history of the Negro, at least for the last seven
centuries, while what is said of him before that time is
interspersed among the annals of other peoples. It
would seem from this fact, at first sight, that those
who know nothing of the Negro, except as they see
him in slavery and in menial positions, are quite
excusable. But scholars deserve no such extenuation.
They know what is written of the ancient Negro—from
which they might, if they chose, infer something
concerning the modern Negro. Travellers, too, are
inexcusable; for they frequently see in other than slave
countries, and in some slave countries too, the
descendant of Africa in positions anything but servile
or menial. True, there was none who cared for us
sufficiently to write our history, in modern days—we
were unable to write it ourselves—in the lands of our
captivity; and in our fatherland, alas! our condition is
far from favourable for the furnishing of historical data.
Scraps, patches, anecdotes, these are all that bear
<pb id="ward270" n="270"/>
record of us. We have now, fortunately, some living
men among us who illustrate our manhood, and live
down the disparagements of our enemies; but as a
rule, our history is that of the chain, the coffle gang,
the slave ship, the middle passage, the plantation-hell!</p>
            <p>If, however, it be true that honourable mention is
made of many of our fathers, and if, in spite of the
most adverse circumstances, we have produced some
worthy sons of such sires, ought we not to have the
benefit of these creditable facts? And yet, I honestly
confess that I fear what I say on this subject will, by
some professedly anti-slavery persons, be regarded as
somewhat objectionable, or as a point upon which it is
not best to say a great deal. But if we do not vindicate
ourselves, who will do it for us? Alas! who indeed? for
we are not without experience in that matter.</p>
            <p>I will venture upon a few points to which I have
had the honour of calling public attention in a lecture
on this subject at Cheltenham, Liverpool, Glasgow,
Ulverstone, and Dundee, and before two metropolitan
literary societies.</p>
            <p>In the sacred Scriptures, no mention is made of the
son of Ham which in any respect represents him as at
all inferior to the sons of Shem or Japhet. I know that
“cursed be Canaan”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref19" n="19" rend="sc" target="note19">*</ref><note id="note19" n="19" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref19"><p>* Genesis ix. 25.</p></note> is
<pb id="ward271" n="271"/>
sometimes quoted as if it came from the lips of God;
although, as the Rev. H. W. Beecher says, and as the
record reads, these are but the words of a newly
awakened drunken man. There was about as much
inspiration in these words, as there might have been
in anything said by Lot on two very disgraceful nights
in his existence. I admit, of course, that the
descendants of Canaan have since been the
“servants of servants”; but I do deny that God is
responsible for the words of Noah at that time, and I
also deny that there is any sort of connection between
his prediction and the enslavement of the Negro. The
Scriptures nowhere allude to it in that sense: indeed, I
see no more sanction to that prediction than I see
approval of his debauch, in the Scriptures. Besides,
how many other than Africans have been enslaved,
oppressed, and made “servants of servants,” since the
time of that prediction!</p>
            <p>Aside from this one point, however, is the fact that
the first person made a slave, of whom we read in the
Bible, was sold <hi rend="italics">to</hi> Egyptians. Joseph was sold into
Egypt. The Israelites were oppressed by Egyptians.
Moses was called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, and
was thus heir apparent to the Egyptians, the most
powerful throne in the world. After the exodus, and
the establishment of the Jewish empire, frequent
mention of an honourable
<pb id="ward272" n="272"/>
kind is made of the Egyptians, with whom
Solomon was on the most friendly terms. He took the
daughter of the Egyptian monarch as a wife; he
received the Queen of the South as a distinguished
guest, and treated her so, during her royal visit to the
Jewish capital.</p>
            <p>The Assyrians, with their great city Nineveh, were
descendants of Ham; and surely they are not spoken of
in the Bible disrespectfully. In 1 Chron. iv. 4 it is written,
“And they found fat pasture and good; and the land
was wide, and quiet, and peaceable; for they of Ham
had dwelt there of old.” This, I think, is very important
testimony to the peaceable, quiet, industrious character
of “them of Ham.” A “wide,” well tilled land, having “fat
pasture and good,” speaks well of their energy,
industry, skill, and success, as agriculturists, as well as
of their wealth. They had an ancient, honourable name—
“they had dwelt there of old;” and that “they had dwelt
there of old” seemed to be abundant reason, in the
opinion of the sacred writer, for the respectability of the
country, and its prosperous, wealthy appearance. The
“quietness and peaceableness” of the country—the
reason given for which was, that “they of Ham had
dwelt there of old”—is sufficient testimony to the high
character of that people; and it agrees exactly with what
all know, who know anything, of the race:
<pb id="ward273" n="273"/>
they are aware that Negroes exhibit most prominently
those characteristics which accord with quietness and
peaceableness. I set a very high value upon this
piece of sacred testimony, and am very grateful that it
is in the Bible. “Cursed be Canaan” did not hinder
this!</p>
            <p>I am not at all forgetful of the wickedness of the
ancient Negroes. In this, as in other things, they
showed their likeness to, their oneness with, the
human race generally. They committed just such sins
as did other people, and the impartial Jehovah treated
them accordingly. Hence the overthrow of Egypt and
the destruction of Assyria.</p>
            <p>To come down to New Testament times, we find
(Acts xiii. 1) among the teachers, Simeon, who “was
called Niger”—I presume, because he was black. Dr.
Patten thinks it was because of his black hair: there is
nothing to designate that the adjective ‘niger’ relates
to hair. But it is put in the masculine gender, while
‘coma,’ hair, is feminine; and it is so put as to indicate
a surname, which in those days was significant of
some such peculiarity as the term naturally implies.
Queen Candace is spoken of in no mean terms, nor is
her minister—Prime Minister, I believe—to whose
chariot Philip had especial directions from heaven to
“join himself.”</p>
            <p>I will not again allude to the great theologians
<pb id="ward274" n="274"/>
of early days, of whom I have frequently spoken; but
it is perhaps admissible to step aside to profane
history for a few passages of testimony concerning
the ancient Negro. Diodorus Siculus says nothing
discreditable of the Negro of his times. Carthage was
not the meanest of countries, though Hannibal, like his
subjects, was black. No doubt there was a good deal
going on in Carthage, while Hannibal was besieging
Rome, which one could not but be reminded of last
winter; but that was not <hi rend="italics">(so the Crimean campaign
shows)</hi> peculiar to blacks. But I will fortify this part of
the subject by a single quotation, and that quotation
shall come from an American, a distinguished
American, the Honourable Alexander H. Everett.
Speaking on this point, he says—“Trace this very
civilization, of which we are so proud, to its origin,
and where do you find it? We received it from our
European ancestry; they from the Greeks and the
Romans; those from the Jews; but whence did the
Jews receive it? From Egypt and Ethiopia—in one word,
from Africa!” He then adverts to the fact, that
“Moses, the great Jewish legislator, was a graduate of
an Egyptian college.” Speaking of their progress and
great proficiency in some of the most useful arts, Mr.
Everett holds the following language:—“The ruins of
Egypt will be, what they are now, the wonder and the
admiration of
<pb id="ward275" n="275"/>
the civilized world, when St. Peter's and St. Paul's, the
present pride of London and of Rome, shall have
crumbled into dust.” I do not agree with Mr. Everett,
touching the “crumbling of St. Peter's and St. Paul's”;
but the reader will recollect that Macaulay holds like
opinions, combated by Lord John Russell. It is not
strange, then, that Mr. Everett should hold them. The
belief is very common, that nations “ripe and rot,” and
go away into a decline, of necessity. Mr. Everett
maintains that belief: I do not. But his idea is, that
Egyptian architecture and masonry will, as ruins,
remain permanent when those of London and Rome
shall be sought for in vain. Such is this learned
gentleman's idea of the superiority of the former.</p>
            <p>In the same speech Mr. Everett says, when alluding
to the superior learning of ancient Africans, “Those
stirring spirits, Homer, Pythagoras, and others,
travelled among those Africans, as did the sons of the
wealthy Greeks and Romans, to acquire the
completion of their education, and to give the
finishing touch to their verses, just as our sons and
poets now travel in Germany and Italy for a like
purpose.”</p>
            <p>Knowing that his countrymen are exceedingly
unwilling to believe that anything good or great ever
emanated from one wearing a black skin, and knowing
that those who cannot dispute the honourable
<pb id="ward276" n="276"/>
history of ancient Africans frequently deny that
they were blacks, Mr. Everett remarks—“Sir, some
persons say that, although the Egyptians and
Ethiopians were Africans, they were not black.
Herodotus, the father of history, travelled among
them, and he tells you they were black men, with
crisped woolly hair; and I cannot bring myself to
believe that Herodotus could not distinguish black
from white, when he saw it. Moreover, the same
testimony is borne by Greeks and Romans of
undoubted veracity, who knew them as well as we
know our Canadian neighbours.” Mr. Everett was a
citizen of Massachusetts, and he made the speech
with which I have made so free before the
Massachusetts Colonization Society, in 1839. This
gentleman was American Minister Plenipotentiary to
China, during the presidency of Mr. Tyler. Another of
the Everett family, the Honourable Edward Everett
(who, during the administration of the same President,
was Minister to the Court of St. James'), bears like
testimony concerning the Negro, before the American
Colonization Society, at a later date. I regret having no
copy of that speech at hand.</p>
            <p>I hope I have in the several parts of this book
shown that the modern Negro is worthy of his ancient
paternity. He has endured oppression the deepest
and most degrading—oppression that has fewer
redeeming features than any other beneath
<pb id="ward277" n="277"/>
the sun. John Wesley called it “the sum of all villanies
—the vilest system of oppression upon which the sun
of God ever shone.” That the modern Negro has
endured this, speaks much of his fortitude, and more
of God's favour toward him. But in the midst of
oppression, the Negro has shown both capacity and
desire for improvement; which are not only
commendable, but which entitle him to a place among
the most progressive of the human race. Curran,
Emmett, O'Connell, O'Brien, and Barrington, are names
of which Ireland may justly be proud. To attempt to
mention like names, among either the living or the
dead, of England and Scotland, were to far exceed the
limits of this humble volume. Among the peers of this
good realm, how many are there not, who “rose from
the ranks,” as military men say—rose by the force of
their learning, their industry, their talent! Are not the
British bar and the British bench a sort of gateway and
avenue to the highest distinctions of this kind?
Across the ocean, and in the colonies, you see almost
the entire population self-made men. They are justly
honoured of all who know them. Everybody agrees
that they are entitled to the greater credit, for having
overcome mighty obstacles, in the shape of poverty
and its thousand-and-one discouraging attendants;
but not one of them was obliged to start from such
<pb id="ward278" n="278"/>
a position as that in which slavery <hi rend="italics">keeps</hi>
its victim, or in which it <hi rend="italics">leaves</hi> him when he becomes free, either by
law or by flight. Those had honour, fame, emolument,
to beckon them on; they had glorious precedents
before them; the path of competition was as open to
them as to any others; the road to distinction was as
free for them to travel as for men of any grade or birth.
These had no precedents, no encouragements, no
lights by the wayside. They were discouraged on
every hand. Schools were closed against them;
colleges denied them their classic privileges—honours
were not for blacks. Fame—fame for a Negro? The very
idea was out of the question! He may fight his
country's battles, as did many in the war of the
Revolution; but after that, he must sink down to the
condition of a mere Negro, deprived of the common
civilities of social life, denied his rights, and trampled
upon by all classes.</p>
            <p>In the last war between Great Britain and the United
States, blacks were twice called out to fight their
country's battles. General Jackson said to them, in his
second proclamation, “Soldiers! when I called upon
you on a previous occasion, upon the banks of the
Sabine, I knew that you possessed an enthusiasm
capable of the performance of noble things; but your
deeds of valour upon the field of battle far transcended
my most sanguine expectations.”
<pb id="ward279" n="279"/>
They came again, at their general's call: they
were no inefficient aid in the gaining of the celebrated
“victory of New Orleans,” 8th January, 1815; but all
who were slaves before they entered the army were
returned to their masters, when the battle was over!
They were denied the least share in the liberties for
which they had fought and bled.</p>
            <p>The Negro has few or none of the stimulants and
encouragements which urge and allure other men to
great attainments. The Irish lad, whose father was a
labourer, knows that if he can find a few friends to aid
him, he may enter the university. Acquiring a good
education, he may have the same opportunity to
distinguish himself that any other Irishman enjoys. He
may be, in his way, an Emmett or a Curran. He knows
what made them what they were, and the same
opportunities are his. The English boy whose father
may be a mechanic or an artisan, and who aspires to
something higher than the paternal condition, has but
to nerve himself for the conflict with obstacles, and his
good character, a little patronage, hard study, and
persevering diligence, will do for him what it has done
for some of those who now stand in the highest places
in the land. No discouragement frowns upon him but
such as some one before him has overcome. The path
is a trodden one; the
<pb id="ward280" n="280"/>
goal is before him; the prize glitters in his sight;
facilities increase as difficulties are overcome. The
race may be toilsome, long, requiring great effort; but
there are abundant encouragements to run it. The
Scotch lad, who desires learning and a place for
usefulness, perhaps finds the readiest aids of all
others. His minister is both willing and able to instruct
him. A Scottish clergyman takes a paternal interest in
almost every child in his parish. If any evince talent,
the minister is one of the first to find it out; he is the
most anxious to <sic corr="develop">develope</sic> it. Educational institutions
abound in his country; they are within the reach of
persons who are far from being rich. If he be poor, his
neighbours will contribute to nothing more freely than
to aid him in the acquisition of learning. He looks
about him; he sees that many of the most able and the
most useful men, in all the learned professions, the
ministry included, were once poor lads like himself.
Turning his eyes southward, he sees the same remark
applies, in a very great measure, to England. He easily
learns that in Wales and in Ireland this is true to a
proverb. And as for obstacles, what Scotchman ever
turned his back upon <hi rend="italics">them?</hi> What are hindrances
made for, but to be overcome? and what are
Scotchmen made for, but to overcome them?</p>
            <p>The Welsh boy has a history, the history of an
<pb id="ward281" n="281"/>
unconquered people, to stir up his manhood. The Pole
recollects the days of former Polish greatness and
glory. The Slavonian eloquently recounts the wrongs
of an injured nationality, until he sends a thrill through
the hearts of countless sympathizers. The Greek
knows no reason why modern Greece may not, at some
time, establish other than mere historical relations to
great Greece of old. Why may not he, and others of
his generation, do somewhat towards this work? The
Jew, proud of his unbroken relations to the patriarchs
and the people most honoured of God, hopes for the
restoration of Israel, and sees in the growing public
favour of his cause, and the increasing wealth of his
people, abundant reason to hope for their possession
of long withheld rights in Gentile communities, and the
dawning of the day when the sons of Abraham shall
be gathered and blest. All of these have enough to
cheer, encourage, and stimulate them. That under such
auspices, they should produce men of power and
renown, is not to be wondered at. It is, most
appropriately, a subject of universal admiration.</p>
            <p>But the Negro, especially the American Negro, has
no encouragement of the sort. His sky is sunless,
starless; deep, black clouds, admitting no ray of light,
envelope his horizon. What is there for him in past
history? slavery. What is the
<pb id="ward282" n="282"/>
condition of the majority of his class? slavery. What
are the signs of the times, so far as the disposition of
their oppressors is concerned? continual slavery. If
educated, what position may he acquire? that of a
menial. What are the opportunities for education? such
only as may be inferred from the rejection of Negroes
from most of the halls of learning in the land. What
encouragements has he from friends, from the feelings
of the mass of the people, from the institutions of his
native country? none, absolutely none. James McCune
Smith was rejected from Geneva College, New York,
because of the African blood in his veins. His
schoolmate, Isaiah G. De Grasse, was received,
because he was not known to be a coloured man.
When the fact that he was coloured became known, he
was treated coolly, made to feel uncomfortable, by
those who always before gave him their friendship.
Daniel Laing was driven from Haward College, where
he was seeking a medical education, because of his
colour; so was Martin R. Delaney. Alexander Crummell
was denied, as was De Grasse, admittance into the New
York Episcopal Theological Seminary (as <hi rend="italics">men,</hi> they
might be admitted as <hi rend="italics">semi-slaves</hi>), when wishing to
prepare for the ministry of that denomination. Their
bishop gave them plainly to understand that they
could never take seats in the Convention of
<pb id="ward283" n="283"/>
his diocese. If a white man be rector of a Church of
blacks, <hi rend="italics">he</hi> is excluded from the Convention! William
Douglass is the best reader of the Church Service in
Philadelphia: he has no more seat in the Episcopal
Convention of that State, than if he were a dog.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref20" n="20" rend="sc" target="note20">*</ref></p>
            <note id="note20" n="20" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref20">
              <p>* This applies both to New York and Pennsylvania. In neither is a
black Episcopal minister admitted to the Convention. The Hon. William
Jay, and his son John Jay, Esq., have laboured to have the rule altered in
New York, but to no purpose.</p>

            <p>If, then, we have among us men who have come up
from slavery and made for themselves a name—a few of
whom I have taken the liberty freely to refer to—they
have done so in spite of discouragements, without aid,
in the absence of cheering, stimulating, inviting
prospects; indeed, without hopes. This short sentence
embodies the history of the struggles of all the learned
and useful black men we have in the United States.</p>
            <p>I beg to add another fact. The educated Negro in
America is a greater sufferer than the uneducated; the
more his feelings are refined, the more keenly he feels
the sting of the serpent prejudice. That is natural; but
it is aggravated by the fact—one of great discredit to
Americans—that an educated Negro, as a rule, is treated
no better than one uneducated. But that is not all: he is
made the object of peculiarly offensive treatment,
because of his superior attainments; he is said to be
“out of
<pb id="ward284" n="284"/>
his place”; he is thought to be “assuming the
place of a white man.” Were he only a menial,
or an ordinary labourer, then he would not be
treated so well as white men in the same position,
but then he would be more “in his place.” Any
one can imagine how acutely an educated man
must feel this. I am not an educated man; but I
have seen those, who are, writhe under this worse
than brutal treatment, until my heart has ached for
them. May I be pardoned for saying, that the
educated among us deserve the credit, at least, of a
place and a name among the respectable of the
world? Others mitigate their sufferings and multiply
their means of enjoyment, by learning: but
with us, this does not increase the latter (I mean
in an ordinary sense), while it multiplies the former;
and any attempt at education, both in itself
and in its consequences, is “the pursuit of knowledge
under difficulties,” with a witness!</p>
            <p>In this country it is difficult to understand how
little difference is made in the treatment of black
men, in respect to their position. Englishmen do
not expect servants to ride in first-class carriages;
but a person of wealth or position, of whatever
colour, has, in this respect, just what he pays for.
In New York, however, the Rev. Dr. Pennington
can no more ride in an omnibus than any other
black person, however inferior to him. The richest
<pb id="ward285" n="285"/>
coloured man in Philadelphia cannot purchase a first-class
railway ticket for New York; neither could he
obtain for his son the opportunity of being educated
in any college of the many in either New York or
Philadelphia. What progress we have made has been
under the frown of these obstacles. May it not be
hoped that, having combated so much, we may
overcome more? In that worst of all countries, the
United States, the Negro not only exhibits the fact
that
<q direct="unspecified">“All is not lost,”</q>
but he shows a tendency for improvement; he gives
evidence of having cultivated this tendency; he
displays success in this endeavour. I beg to claim,
that if other people have entitled themselves to lasting
honour from mankind, for what they have done, for
the brilliant specimens of manhood they have
presented to the world's admiring gaze—specimens of
self-made men, in unfavourable circumstances—my
people, having done something like it in
circumstances a thousandfold more forbidding,
should not be altogether struck from the roll of, at
least, <hi rend="italics">the respectable among mankind.</hi></p>
            <p>I am quite free to confess that, in this regard, the
American is more worthy than the British Negro. The
time was, when slavery reigned triumphant in our
colonies. Then, if a coloured man distinguished
himself as did the Honourable
<pb id="ward286" n="286"/>
Mr. Jordan, of Kingston, and others, they did so in
the midst of the almost universal enslavement of their
own race. Still they were free, and, as freemen, equal in
law to all others. Prejudice did exist, as a matter of
social caste; but it did not destroy legal rights, as it
does in America.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref21" n="21" rend="sc" target="note21">*</ref></p>
            <note id="note21" n="21" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref21">
              <p>* Since writing the above, I learn, from the excellent work of Mr.
Phillippo, that in very early days blacks were disfranchised and otherwise
oppressed in Jamaica. My remark above would apply to a much later period.
I wish every Englishman would read “Jamaica in its Past and Present State”
(Snow, 35, Paternoster Row).</p>
            </note>
            <p>When the laws of Jamaica made distinctions as to
colour, I doubt if black Jamaica freemen made such
attainments and progress as our people, in the States.
They acquired more property, but they excelled in
nothing else. In these respects they resemble the
present free blacks of the Southern States.</p>
            <p>Now, if we of the British dominions do not advance
rapidly, we shall have no excuse; and, what is worse, we
shall burden our cause with reproach. I was at one
time most anxious about this matter; but think now, we
shall be able “to report progress,” as they say in the
legislature, and to do our share in the great work of
redeeming and disenthralling the long-outraged race
of Ham.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref22" n="22" rend="sc" target="note22">†</ref></p>

            <p>I know not what is to be our future, but think these
are very significant facts—that fourteen millions of us
should be on the American continent: that slavery
should have ceased in one half of the American
States, at so early a day: that in the Slave States the
Negroes who are bondsman are being rapidly
improved, by the two following processes, viz.; 1, The
constant admixture of the more intelligent slaves, from
the more Northern Slave States, among those less
intelligent, in the far South—a fact which grows out of
the raising of slaves in the former, to sell in the latter.
2, The increasing admixture of Anglo-Saxon blood
with that of the Negro. If slavery does not work its
own ruin by those two abominations, there is no truth
in philosophy.</p>
            <p>To return: Great Britain has freed all her slaves;
France has freed hers; other European powers are
earnestly discussing measures of a similar kind; the
freed men of all countries are improving rapidly; Brazil
has abandoned the slave trade; commerce with Africa
is increasing; friendly feeling towards the Negro is in
the ascendant everywhere, except in America, and it is
increasing even there. It does seem as if God were
preserving and educating the Negro for some great
purposes, yet undeveloped; and as if the Anglo-Saxon
were in some way to be connected
<pb id="ward288" n="288"/>
with, first, his oppression, then his emancipation;
and perhaps, finally, the two are to be associated
in some important future service to the family of
man.</p>
            <p>Doubtless, all who think on this subject agree in
desiring that whatever may be done shall be done
in harmony with the divine will, as written in the
great law of our common brotherhood.</p>

            <head>BRITISH ABOLITIONISM.</head>
            <p>I WAS honoured, both in 1853 and in 1854, by
invitations to address the British and Foreign 
Anti-Slavery Society; in fact, the honour of a similar
invitation was conferred upon me this year, but I was
unable to attend. Added to the pleasure of labouring,
however feebly, in the anti-slavery cause, was the fact
that, upon the occasion first named, the Earl of
Shaftesbury presided. To sustain any relation to that
prince of noblemen, even for so short a time, was an
honour any man might covet. Besides, among the
gentlemen on the Committee of that Society are some
of my dearest personal friends, to serve whom I would
do anything. At that meeting, in 1853, I became
acquainted with Lord Shaftesbury. No one had
introduced me to him, and I was feeling all the
awkwardness of being a stranger to the noble Lord
whom, as chairman of the meeting, I was soon to
address; but as the speaker next before myself was
near concluding, his Lordship leaned
<pb id="ward290" n="290"/>
towards me and said, “I believe <hi rend="italics">you</hi> are to speak next,
Mr. Ward.” Thus the nobleman's affability removed
my embarrassment, consequent upon the neglect of
commoners. Thus I became acquainted with the head
of the great house of Ashley: and there commenced a
series of kind actions on the part of his Lordship
which lay me under unceasing obligations.</p>
            <p>It is sometimes said, that in Great Britain there is no
need of discussing the question of slavery. Two very
strong objections are made against it—one is, that as
there are no slaves in the British empire now, there is
nothing for the British people to do on the subject; the
other is, that as the discussion of slavery is
necessarily, now, the discussion of a subject affecting
other nations and governments than our own, such
discussion will be regarded by those concerned as an
interference with their affairs. This remark is made with
especial reference to America and the Americans, who
are, of all people in the world, the most sensitive on
this particular point. That I was obliged to meet these
objections, at different points of my travels, I hardly
need say. To answer them formed no small part of my
work in England. I hope I shall be pardoned for
introducing here what little I have to say on this
matter.</p>
            <p>1. It is quite true, I am but too thankful to say, that
the British flag does not float anywhere over
<pb id="ward291" n="291"/>
slaves. Now, in the colonies as at home, the words of
Whittier apply to every man, woman, and child—
<q direct="unspecified"><lg><l>“Freedom, hand in hand with labour,</l><l>Walketh, strong and brave;</l><l>While, on the brow of his neighbour,</l><l>No man writeth—Slave!”</l></lg></q>
The British people, to their infinite credit, responded
to the clarion voices of their Brougham, Knibb,
Buxton, Clarkson, Wilberforce, Macaulay, Allen,
Cropper, and Rathbone, and shattered every stone of
the accursed old Bastile of British slavery. Yet it is not
to be forgotten, that long ere that was done, British
hands had become red with the innocent blood of
millions of slaves. The old slave trade, with its horrors
(Liverpool being its chief mart); the horrible
plantation scenes of Jamaica and other West India
islands, the barbarisms of the Mauritius, the atrocities
of the Cape—oh, these darkest, most guilty pages of
British history, are not to be easily forgotten! While
we were guilty of these abominations, and their
attendant crimes, the whole weight of British influence
was given to the furtherance of slavery in other
countries; what they did, we did. They may have
surpassed us in cruelty,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref23" n="23" rend="sc" target="note23">*</ref><note id="note23" n="23" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref23"><p>* That is scarcely possible, however.</p></note> but still we were connected
with the same atrocious system. The guilt of our
colonies was endorsed at home; nay, the owners of
colonial slaves were dwellers at the West End of
London,
<pb id="ward292" n="292"/>
our senators and our peers. Commoners who were
planters, in London, Liverpool, and Glasgow, rolled in
untold wealth, the fruit of the Negro's unpaid toil. They
were regarded with a sort of deference, such as is paid
to the American slaveholder at Boston, New York, and
Philadelphia. A baronetcy or a peerage was scarcely
more desirable or more honourable, than to be known
as a <hi rend="italics">great West India planter,</hi> the owner of so many
hundred slaves! Sometimes, indeed, baronet or peer,
and planter, were associated titles of the same
distinguished individual. These brought all the
influence of wealth, name, position, patronage, and
senatorial place, to bear upon the Government, which
but too easily winked at the wickedness and obeyed
the demands of the then British slave power. Thank
God, I am writing <hi rend="italics">past</hi> history; but history it is!</p>
            <p>Having done so much for slavery, as a nation and
as individuals, it is not to be denied that the British
people have contracted no small share of blame for
encouraging the slavery of other peoples, by their evil
example. It can scarcely be said that the abolition of
the slave trade, the procuring of some few treaties
against it in conjunction with other nations, and the
abolition of colonial slavery, at a very late day, wiped
out <hi rend="italics">all</hi> our guilt.</p>
            <p>In May, 1772, a decision, procured by the
persevering diligence of the immortal Granville Sharpe,
<pb id="ward293" n="293"/>
was rendered by Lord Chief Justice Mansfield, to the
effect that the arrival of a slave upon British soil made
him a freeman. In 1814 a number of Negroes escaped
from North Carolina to the ships composing the British
fleet, commanded by Admiral Sir George Cockburn.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref24" n="24" rend="sc" target="note24">*</ref>
<note id="note24" n="24" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref24"><p>* <hi rend="italics">See</hi> “Jay's View of the Action of the Federal Government in behalf of
Slavery.”</p></note>Upon their being claimed by the American authorities,
in behalf of their masters, Sir George refused to deliver
them, in virtue of that decision, declaring the law of
the soil to be the law of the ship to which the Negroes
had fled. In 1825 the American Government desired
the British Government to deliver to them slaves who
had escaped to Canada. This was refused, in
accordance with Lord Mansfield's decision. But while,
by virtue of that decision, we freed the slaves of
foreigners, when they touched our soil, we, in spite of
that decision, held slaves ourselves! Nay, more.
Several American slave ships, with slave cargoes on
board, were driven upon our West India Islands.
Touching those islands, the slaves were made
freemen. Still, we held hundreds of thousands of
slaves on those islands—we made our soil free to other
people's slaves, while upon the same soil <hi rend="italics">we</hi> held
slaves!</p>
            <p>What a glaring contradiction was here! “British
soil is free soil to the slaves of other countries; it
<pb id="ward294" n="294"/>
is slave soil to our own subjects.” That was
substantially our saying. If the highest court in the
empire made British air free to foreign lungs, why did it
not make that air equally free to British lungs? in a
word, why did not the poor slave of the colonial
plantations receive the benefits of this decision? I beg
to say, I cannot admit that
<q direct="unspecified">“The why is plain as way to parish church.”</q>
Is it not true, that we held half a million of slaves in
our colonies, in as open contradiction to the law as
laid down by Lord Chief Justice Mansfield on the 5th
of May, 1772, as do our American brethren at this day
hold three millions in contradiction to their
Declaration of Independence as laid down by
Jefferson, <hi rend="italics">four years two months and twenty
nine days</hi> thereafter? and from the date of the former,
until 1832, were we one whit better than our
neighbours? We gave them the most practical
encouragement. We began our hypocrisy more than
<hi rend="italics">four years</hi> before they began theirs. And it is a
singular fact, that each nation, at the time to which I
refer, robbed about half a million of slaves of rights
which, according to public and solemn declarations of
both, belonged to the subjects, to <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the subjects, of
each: indeed, ours was the greatest inconsistency, as
we violated a judicial decision, while they simply
trampled upon an abstract declaration of political
sentiments. They
<pb id="ward295" n="295"/>
incorporated the same sentiments in their Constitution,
but this was not until 1789. We had been stultifying
ourselves, then, for seventeen years! I submit whether
such sinners, though penitent, “bring forth fruits meet
for repentance” without seeking, if possible, to
counteract the effects of their own evil example, by
something more than merely emancipating their own
slaves.</p>
            <p>But there is, if possible, a still darker shade in this
picture. On the sailing of Sir George Cockburn's fleet to
the West Indies, the American authorities followed it,
and renewed their demand for the slaves. Sir George,
true to his British principles, repeated and persisted in
his refusal to deliver them. The Negroes, of course,
remained free. But the American Government, always
persevering in such cases, made their demand for gold
in payment for them, through their Minister at London.
It was refused. A long correspondence then
commenced, which did not terminate until 1836, 
twenty-two years after. And how did it terminate? By our
Government paying, in gold, the sum of £40,000, by way
of compensation for the Negroes; and after paying
this, twenty-two years' interest was demanded, and we
paid that! Some six or seven cases are on record, of
our complicity in American slavery, by paying for the
cargoes of slave ships wrecked on our islands:
<pb id="ward296" n="296"/>
indeed, we almost always paid money in such cases,
until after the passing of the Emancipation Act.</p>
            <p>To say nothing of the perfect impunity with which
we allow Spain to violate a treaty against the slave
trade, for compliance with which we paid her £400,000,
nearly forty years ago, and not to speak of the
shamefully loose provisions of our treaty with the
United States<ref targOrder="U" id="ref25" n="25" rend="sc" target="note25">*</ref><note id="note25" n="25" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref25"><p>* I refer to Mr. Jay again on this point, and ask attention to what that
learned American jurist, the son of the great John Jay, says on the subject. I
give the substance only of Judge Jay's remarks. It seems that the United
States Government proposed to the British Government a convention
against the slave trade. The British Government readily complied. After
waiting a reasonable time, the latter gently reminded the former that nothing
had been done in the case. Another pause ensued. Then the British
Government prepared a treaty, and sent it to Washington for sanction. That
treaty provided that, if subjects of either Government were found engaged in the slave trade, on the coast of Africa, America, or the West Indies, they
should be subjected, on conviction thereof, to certain specified penalties.
The American Senate struck out the word “America”; thus exempting their
own coast, for obvious reasons, from the operations of the treaty.</p><p>The treaty also provided that, should subjects of either Government be
convicted of being engaged in the slave trade, in vessels owned <hi rend="italics">or
chartered</hi> by the parties so convicted, they should be punished, &amp;c.
The United States Senate purged the treaty of the words “or chartered.”
Hence an American, or any one else, desirous to engage in this abominable
traffic, had only to charter—not to put himself to the expense of purchasing or building—a vessel, and proof of its being such exempted him from the
punishment threatened in that treaty.</p><p>Again: the treaty, as it left Britain, provided that punishment should be
inflicted upon subjects of either Government engaged in the slave trade,
under the British or the American Flag, upon conviction. The Senate of
America struck out “or the American”; so that trading in slaves on the
American coast, under the American flag or in a chartered vessel, is no
violation of the treaty, as it now stands! I call this treaty “shamefully loose.”
Is it not so?</p></note> for the same purpose, let us look at
one more fact which shows that we are far from being
innocent of <hi rend="italics">present</hi> complicity in the crime of
slaveholding.</p>
            <p>In the Slave States it is law, that a free Negro from
abroad or from the Northern States shall, upon
<pb id="ward297" n="297"/>
landing on their shores, be imprisoned until his ship
sails. When she sails, the captain must pay the
charges of his arrest and imprisonment, or he is to be
sold, to pay them, <hi rend="italics">into slavery for life!</hi> For thirty
years <hi rend="italics">this has been done to British subjects, to the
knowledge of the British Government!</hi> The
Honourable Arthur F. Kinnaird has twice, within the
past two years, brought this subject before the
Government, but the answers to his questions have
been most unsatisfactory. They reveal the fact, that
but little care is felt about this matter in Downing
Street. In the winter of 1854-55, one or two of the
Atlantic Slave States so modified their law that a
British Negro, arriving there, shall be forbidden to
land, and the captain is put under heavy bonds, which
are to be forfeited if the Negro goes on shore. This
odious law is made for the security of slavery, by
preventing free Negroes from associating with the
slaves and teaching them the
<pb id="ward298" n="298"/>
way to a free country. Conniving at it, our
Government, certainly in a degree, shares its guilt. The
rights of a British subject, of whatever colour, ought
not to be suffered thus to be jeopardized for the
accommodation of our trade in slave-grown cotton.</p>
            <p>Considering the depth of our past guilt, and our
share in planting, encouraging, and perpetuating
slavery in America and elsewhere, I do not think we
ought to close our lips until all whom we have for
centuries aided in this sin shall be brought to
repentance for it. Upon the high grounds of our
common humanity and our holy religion, I am sure I
need not say one word, except it be to deplore that
mere business considerations, the arguments of
Lombard Street and the Exchange, should so chill the
hearts and dry up “the milk of human kindness” in
Englishmen's bosoms as to put aside the claims of our
suffering brethren.</p>
            <p>2. As to its being considered offensive to American
or other slaveholders that Englishmen condemn
slavery and labour for its overthrow, it is well enough
to observe, that part of what we discuss is our own
guilty complicity. Surely this cannot be intermeddling
with other people's affairs. The slave being our
brother, and the slaveholder being our brother too, we
may claim the right of obeying the command, “Thou
shalt not suffer sin
<pb id="ward299" n="299"/>
upon thy neighbour, thou shalt in anywise rebuke
him.” Besides, the great methods of a practical
character by which British abolitionists seek to
destroy slavery are made upon our own soil: they are,
<hi rend="italics">the elevation of the British Negro, and supplying the
British markets with staples from the British tropics</hi>—thus rebuking slavery by the former; and competing
with it, driving it out of the market, by the latter. Is it
objectionable to elevate and make good subjects of
our own Negroes? Is it objectionable to till our own
soil, and sell the produce thereof in our own markets?
Would our American neighbours listen one moment to
any objections Englishmen might make to their doing
things of like character?</p>
            <p>It is said, however, by some persons who object
most strongly to British abolitionism, that Great
Britain entailed slavery upon the Americans. This I
think is very doubtful. If it were true, however, it
would not only <hi rend="italics">justify,</hi> but it would <hi rend="italics">authorize,</hi> the
very thing that is complained of. Let us see. I do not
believe the charge of the entailment of slavery upon
America by the British. I admit, of course, that much
guilt and great responsibility, such as I have already
referred to, rest upon the people of Britain; but as to
entailing slavery upon Americans, how can that be
true, when they threw overboard <hi rend="italics">the tea</hi> at Boston
harbour, and threw off
<pb id="ward300" n="300"/>
the British rule? Could they not have disposed of
slavery quite as easily? If not as easily, had they not
the same power over it? Had the British people or
Government any power over them <hi rend="italics">after</hi> they became
independent? If they retained slavery <hi rend="italics">after that,</hi> was it
not because <hi rend="italics">they chose to do so?</hi> They answer these
questions by saying, as they do every day, that they
found it impossible to agree upon a constitution
without agreeing either to let slavery alone, or to
secure it! They claim pay for their slaves, and they
claim immunity from rebuke, on the ground that slavery
is constitutional. If so, who made it so? If so, what
becomes of the charge of its <hi rend="italics">entailment</hi> upon them by
Britain?</p>
            <p>On the other hand, if it be true that British people
<hi rend="italics">did</hi> entail slavery upon the Americans, <hi rend="italics">they</hi> of all
people are the ones to seek the <hi rend="italics">undoing</hi> of what they
have <hi rend="italics">done.</hi></p>
            <p>The good example set to other nations by the
British Government in this matter, and the sustenance
given the Government by the British people, entitle
them to be heard on the subject. They have sinned,
and they have repented. They have a right to “tell
their experience.” The Negro in America looks to the
Englishman as his friend. It is with his especial consent that the Englishman
speaks in his behalf. The Englishman's friendly
regard for the Negro is well known to the latter.
<pb id="ward301" n="301"/>
The poor slave, even, cannot be kept ignorant of this.
Some Englishmen, I am proud to know, are quite
willing to be looked upon as guardians, protectors,
and defenders, of the poor and needy Negro.</p>
            <p>It was with the greatest delight that I found, in every
part of England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, that
abolitionism is not a mere abstract idea, but a practical
question of grave importance. It is not because, to a
certain extent, anti-slavery sentiments are fashionable
and natural, that these persons approve them, but
because of their intrinsic character. Generally, the
children of the abolitionists of early days are proud of
their anti-slavery inheritance. Some few, I regret to say,
do not walk in their parents' footsteps: it may be
because their pursuits are somewhat different. There is
great occasion for rejoicing in the fact, that the leading
abolitionists of Britain are among the most exalted of
the land. I have mentioned the names of some of them.
At their residences, where I had the pleasure of calling
upon them, they impressed me most deeply with the
fact. The Earl of Shaftesbury bade me call upon him as
often as I pleased, to consult him upon matters relating
to my mission. Upon one occasion his Lordship shook
me by the hand, saying, “God bless you, my good
friend! Call again, when you can.” On another
occasion he gently rebuked me for not
<pb id="ward302" n="302"/>
having called more frequently.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref26" n="26" rend="sc" target="note26">*</ref><note id="note26" n="26" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref26"><p>* At that time his Lordship did me the honour to accept my miniature.
The note acknowledging its receipt I keep as a priceless inheritance for
my children.</p></note> Lord Harrowby
conversed freely and with deep interest on the subject,
expressing his desire that Mr. Jordan, a coloured
gentleman who was candidate for the mayoralty of
Kingston, Jamaica, should be elected. Lord Calthorpe
asked me kindly concerning the distinctions between
blacks and whites in America, and remarked that, in the
judgment day, no such distinctions would appear. The
same nobleman most kindly took the chair at my
meeting at Birmingham. I may as well say, briefly, that
the nobility generally whom I had the honour of
meeting treated both me and my cause with the kindest
consideration; none more so than her Grace the
Duchess of Sutherland, her Grace the Duchess of
Argyll, and his Grace the Duke of Argyll. I am under
great obligations to Lord Robert Grosvenor, Lord
Haddo, Lord Ebrington, Lord Waldegrave, the
Honourable Arthur F. Kinnaird, Sir Edward North
Buxton, Sir Thomas D. Acland, Ernest Bunsen, Esq.,
Samuel Gurney, Esq., and many others, too numerous
to mention, but not too numerous both to deserve and
to receive my warmest, humblest thanks.</p>
            <p>Besides the nobility, the English abolitionists are
among the most devotedly pious of the laymen,
<pb id="ward303" n="303"/>
and the most eminent divines of all sections of the
Christian Church. The Rev. Dr. Campbell, of London,
the Rev. Dr. Raffles, of Liverpool, the Rev. Dr. Halley,
of Manchester, the Rev. John Angell James, of
Birmingham, the Rev. James Parsons, of York, the Rev.
Dr. Alexander, of Edinburgh, the Rev. Dr. Robson, of
Glasgow, the Rev. Dr. A. Moreton Brown, of
Cheltenham, George Hitchcock, Esq., Samuel Morley,
Esq., John Crossley, Esq., William P. Paton, Esq., John
Smith, Esq., William Crossfield, Esq., Edward Baines,
Esq., George Leeman, Esq., are instances and
illustrations of this fact. To know that the anti-slavery
cause is in such hands in England and Scotland, and
to know that the honoured names now mentioned are
but representatives of a class embracing the best and
the purest of the earth, is reason enough why one
should feel quite certain of the final success of our
holy cause.</p>
            <p>It is a little remarkable to notice the likeness of
English to American abolitionists, in character and
status. In both countries this precious cause has for
its advocates and standard-bearers the very “salt of
the earth.” It is as if God calls into the service of
defending the poor and the needy those whom by his
grace he has made most like himself. What abundant
evidence there is, in this fact, that the cause is his!</p>

            <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
            <head>INCIDENTS, ETC.</head>
            <p>WHEN I arrived in England, I found Miss Greenfield,
known in America by the <hi rend="italics">soubriquet</hi> of “Black Swan,”
had arrived here. I had the pleasure of hearing her sing
at Stafford House, at a concert attended by some of
the most distinguished of the British nobility. It was a
concert given on purpose to introduce Miss Greenfield
at that house which is nearest in position to the royal
palace, and whose mistress is nearest in rank to
royalty. What a sight for my poor eyes! Stafford
House, British nobility, and a Negress! I saw the
perfect respect with which Miss G. was treated by all.
The Prussian Ambassador was in raptures at her
versatility of voice. Sir David Brewster said to me,
“she has two throats”—alluding to the perfect ease
with which she passed from the highest to the lowest
notes. It was plainly enough to be seen that the
concert had very significant connections with the 
anti-slavery cause. Mrs. Stowe and her brother were there.
The Rev. James Sherman
<pb id="ward305" n="305"/>
was among the guests. Lord Shaftesbury was among
the most conspicuous of them. Then, to remove all
doubt as to the great object of the concert, Lord
Shaftesbury said to me, “We call this house Aunt
Harriet's cabin (the Duchess's name being Harriet);
and I tell her, that it honours her house to have it used
for such a cause and such a purpose.” This, said in
the warm, earnest manner peculiar to his Lordship,
made him appear to me more noble than ever. After
music had ceased, the guests were invited to go over
the house. Lord Blantyre<ref targOrder="U" id="ref27" n="27" rend="sc" target="note27">*</ref><note id="note27" n="27" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref27"><p>* Son-in-law to the Duke of Sutherland.</p></note> kindly showed us the
magnificent pictures in the gallery, and treated us all
as most welcome guests, which doubtless we were.</p>
            <p>The day following, I was invited by Lady Dover to
see from her drawing-room window a review of the
troops, it being the Queen's birthday. Soon after, I
attended a concert of Miss Greenfield's at Hanover
Square Rooms. There I had the honour of being
introduced to the Earl of Carlisle, at his Lordship's
request, by the Rev. C. Beecher. Mentioning the
object of my visit to his Lordship, he readily replied,
“Nothing can be more interesting.”
</p>
            <p>During a trip down the Thames, I had the honour
of an introduction to the Honourable A. F.
<pb id="ward306" n="306"/>
Kinnaird and his amiable lady; and, by Mr. Kinnaird,
to Lord Haddo. The kind interest taken in the coloured
people by these distinguished personages, being to
me an entirely new thing, kept me in a state of most
excited delight. Attending a meeting at Willis's
Rooms, in June of that year, I was introduced by Lord
Shaftesbury to Viscount Ebrington. Calling upon the
latter at his residence, the next day, he was pleased to
bring Jamaica prominently before me, and to express
his deep interest in the people of that island. Stephen
Bourne, Esq., had suggested it before. When the time
came<ref targOrder="U" id="ref28" n="28" rend="sc" target="note28">*</ref><note id="note28" n="28" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref28"><p>* In February, 1854. </p></note> that I was at liberty to consider the subject
more definitely, I took the liberty of writing him on the
subject, whereupon his Lordship honoured me with
an invitation to dine with Lady Ebrington and a party.
There I was introduced to the Earl of Harrowby, the
Honourable John Fortescue, Sir James Weir Hogg,
Governor Wodehouse, of British Guiana, and several
other persons of distinction, all of whom gave me the
highest assurances of their lively regard for the best
weal of the Negro.</p>
            <p>At another time,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref29" n="29" rend="sc" target="note29">†</ref><note id="note29" n="29" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref29"><p>† 24th November, 1853.</p></note> I had the very great pleasure of
being a fellow traveller with the Duke of Argyll and
the Earl of Elgin, from London to Manchester. The
interest these two representatives of the great
<pb id="ward307" n="307"/>
houses of Campbell and Bruce took in the anti-slavery
cause was far more than I was prepared for; but the
intimate acquaintanceship with all the windings and
intricacies of the American slave power, possessed by
the great descendant of Robert Bruce, quite
astonished me. In his place as Governor-General of
Canada, Lord Elgin, with his clear comprehension of
things, has been seeing what was going on in the
adjoining States so plainly, as to understand
American politics and American politicians as well as
if he had been born in that country. But what pleased
me most was the perfect knowledge his Lordship
showed of the anti-slavery question. Charles Sumner,
the anti-slavery senator from Massachusetts, is an
intimate friend of Lord Elgin. The career of Mr. Sumner
in the Senate he understands perfectly; and with it,
his Lordship understands all the minutiæ of the 
anti-slavery struggle, and its issues. Unlike too many
Englishmen, the noble Earl does not keep his
anti-slavery sentiments secret, when on the other side of
the Atlantic. Participating in none of the Yankee
feelings against Negroes, he does not act like them
towards coloured men. Being guided by his own
conscientious sense of right, he does not inquire what
is popular, but treads the path which duty makes
plain. Making no pretensions to philanthropy (though
one of the most liberal of
<pb id="ward308" n="308"/>
all our nobility), his Lordship, both in his
administrations as Governor, and in his intercourse
with others as a gentleman, commingles the
strictly just with the charmingly affable. Like Lord
Carlisle, Lord Elgin has a fulness and a minuteness of
knowledge concerning everything around him which
makes him a most ready instructor, as well as a most
agreeable companion to men of good breeding, of
whatever rank.</p>
            <p>What I saw of Lord Elgin, that day, left me no
reason to wonder that such a Governor-General
should carry all hearts with him in Canada and in
Jamaica, where his Lordship had been viceregent. I
saw just the man to reject the Larwill petition against
the Elgin Settlement; and was abundantly prepared,
from what I had the great privilege of observing that
day, for the two following anecdotes of Lord Elgin:—
When Governor of Jamaica, the noble Lord, like Lord
Sligo, carried out his own convictions as to the rights
and equality of Negroes. On one occasion a black
man<ref targOrder="U" id="ref30" n="30" rend="sc" target="note30">*</ref><note id="note30" n="30" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref30"><p>* I do not know whether this occurred at Kingston or Spanish Town.</p></note> proposed to bring his child to the font for
baptism. The arrangement with the clergyman was
completed; but shortly after, the minister learned that
the Governor was about to bring his child on that
Sunday, whereupon the Negro was advised to
postpone
<pb id="ward309" n="309"/>
the baptism of his child until another time. His
Excellency, hearing this, expressed his entire
willingness to have the black child brought to the font
at the same time with his own; and when the time
came, the Governor and the Negro stood, side by side,
each for his own child, upon terms of perfect equality,
before the altar of God. If any one say that was no
more than right, I beg to remind him, that in those
days, in an island where the Negro had been most
shamefully oppressed, and despised alike by free
coloured people and whites—at a time, too, when the
status of the then recently freed man was much below
what it is now, and when there was a universal ill
feeling towards the Negroes, on account of what was
called the “misfortunes” growing out of emancipation—
at such a time, for a Governor-General, high and illustrious in
rank, a nobleman, descended from the First of Scots,
to make such a demonstration of his practical belief in
the equality and the oneness of our human nature,
and the common level upon which we all stand before
the Almighty Father, was what we blacks may justly
be proud of and grateful for. It was right, simply right;
but in those days <hi rend="italics">right in that direction</hi> was of rare
occurrence, and therefore the more valuable.</p>
            <p>The other anecdote of his Lordship I received
indirectly, but in a most authentic form. Lord
<pb id="ward310" n="310"/>
Elgin was at Washington in 1854, as Her Majesty's
special ambassador to make what is called the
Reciprocity Treaty between the United States and
Canada. It was quite natural that a member of the
British House of Peers should go into Congress
occasionally, during a short residence at the American
capital: Lord Elgin did so. He was there about the
time of the closing scenes of the Congress of 1854 (the
3rd of March). The Honourable Gerrit Smith, from
whom I receive the facts, in giving a most graphic
account of this scene, especially the drunkenness of
honourable members, says, “but what greatly
increased my mortification was, that Lord Elgin, the
Governor-General of Canada, sat by my side, and
witnessed the intemperance of which I complain. I
apologized to his Lordship for it, and he remarked that
he had seen disorder and confusion in the House of
Commons, in former days.” Now, what is there in this
remark of Mr. Smith? It is evidence that Lord Elgin,
when in America, when in Washington, and in
Congress, took a seat beside an abolitionist—being
neither ashamed, as a peer nor as a representative of
the Crown, in a twofold sense, to be found, in the
presence of slaveholders and Northern slaveocrats, in
such company, though knowing perfectly well how
unpopular abolitionism is in that capital; nor
disdaining to take his place
<pb id="ward311" n="311"/>
in Congress beside the most radical, most decided,
abolitionist in the legislature. The reader must know
two facts before he can understand how highly I
appreciate these two anecdotes, especially the last.
1. He must know what it is to see and feel how strongly
the current of public opinion sets, in that great
country, against every phase and semblance of
abolition. 2. He must know also, how few Englishmen
there are who, visiting America, maintain their British
principles on this subject while there. Throughout his
entire career as Governor of Jamaica and as 
Governor-General of Canada, Lord Elgin always 
honoured his principles.</p>
            <p>I said his Lordship makes no pretensions to
philanthropy: I mean, he is a man above all
pretensions—a man of practical realities. What he <hi rend="italics">is,</hi>
he <hi rend="italics">seems;</hi> what he <hi rend="italics">seems,</hi> he <hi rend="italics">is.</hi> I mean, also, that Lord
Elgin is not one of those who claim any especial
favours for the coloured man, or who expect any
especial worship <hi rend="italics">from</hi> him. This is about the sum of
some people's philanthropy, touching the Negro. Lord
Elgin, however, does just what the British Negro
needs at the hands of a British Governor or a British
gentleman—treats him as he would any other man in
like circumstances. For that I thank him, in behalf of
my people. For that reason I was most grateful for the
Providence which gave me the
<pb id="ward312" n="312"/>
honour of a journey of seven hours with so illustrious
a fellow passenger. I write the more freely because
Lord Elgin is a public man, because I write in behalf of
a grateful people, and because I scarcely believe that
this humble volume can travel so far northward as
Dunfermline<ref targOrder="U" id="ref31" n="31" rend="sc" target="note31">*</ref><note id="note31" n="31" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref31"><p>* Lord Elgin's residence.</p></note> before its humble author shall be quite
forgotten.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Argyll was also in the carriage at the
time to which I allude. I had first seen his Grace at
Stafford House. He did me the honour to say to Mrs.
Stowe, he should like to see me. When I waited upon
him, I was treated like a friend. I know no other term
suitably conveying my impression of the easy manner
in which his Grace was pleased to receive and to
converse with me. Afterwards, upon all occasions,
that noblest of the Campbells laid me under
obligations for like affability. As a Minister of Her
Majesty this young nobleman has already
distinguished himself, having been in two successive
Cabinets charged with the war with Russia. At the
head of one of Scotland's most noble houses, she may
justly be proud of him. Early called to the peerage, at
an early age entering the Cabinet, and frequently
having to speak in the House of Lords, in debate with
some of the most skilful tacticians of the Opposition,
always sustaining himself by the exhibition
<pb id="ward313" n="313"/>
of wisdom beyond his years, and giving
promise of great future usefulness, England may
reasonably rejoice that she has the services of one so
able <hi rend="italics">now,</hi> so hopeful for the future. Earnest and
devoted in religion, the friends of Christian
benevolence always find him ready with his purse, his
pen, and his influence, to promote their objects and
encourage their labours. That the British Negro has
such a friend is both a cause of congratulation and a
sign of future blessing. That the down-trodden slave
of my native country may know of one so exalted,
whose bosom is so full of benevolent feeling for him,
is a matter for great thankfulness. Yes; we may all
thank God for the gift of such a nobleman in our
imperial senate, and we may all pray that God may
long spare his useful life.</p>
            <p>The Duchess of Argyll, eldest daughter of the Duke
of Sutherland, is one of the most devotedly
benevolent persons in England. She seems to have
been especially blest with her mother's spirit, and to
be thoroughly imbued with her principles. It seems to
cost her Grace nothing to be kind, because it is so
natural. She has, as well, a most kind manner of
showing kindness. There is a great deal in <hi rend="italics">that.</hi> Some
persons are so rough or so cold, so distant, so
haughty, in doing or rather attempting kindness, as
really to spoil it;
<pb id="ward314" n="314"/>
but the Duchess of Argyll makes her kindness double
by her sweet, smiling, winning way of showing it. I do
not wonder that she is a friend of the slave. Her
mother, and her noble maternal ancestry for
generations, have been so; and it would be difficult for
such a heart not to feel for the woes of others, and
condemn the wrongs inflicted upon them. In having
made the acquaintance of the Duke of Argyll and her
Grace the Duchess—in having seen the kind Christian
manner in which they devote themselves to works of
love, and educate their children to the same—I feel
that I have enjoyed an honour and a pleasure which
fall to the lot of but few colonists, and appreciate it
accordingly.</p>
            <p>Wishing to see all that I could while in England, and
having a strong desire to go to the Houses of
Parliament, I communicated my desire to the
Honourable Arthur Kinnaird, M.P., and to the Earl of
Shaftesbury. Mr. Kinnaird kindly gave me an order for
the House of Commons, and Lord Shaftesbury
procured for me admission to the House of Lords. In
the former there were no questions of interest under
discussion, and but few members were in attendance.
It was a morning session. Subsequently, Edward Ball,
Esq., member for Cambridgeshire, kindly showed me to
the visitors' gallery, where I had the pleasure of
<pb id="ward315" n="315"/>
hearing Lord Palmerston and Mr. Frederick Peel. The
veneration I had from my childhood felt for Viscount
Palmerston, as his name and that of Lord John Russell
had always been associated in my mind with the
greatest of past or present British statesmen, gave me
a peculiar pleasure in hearing him. It was a peculiar
time. The good ship of the State had been but recently
committed to his care. There had just been a sort of
mutiny, at least a desertion, of some of the officers.
There had been great dissatisfaction; alas, there had
been great cause for it! The public mind had been
brought, by the suffering of the army, the seeming
want of vigour in the former Cabinet, the apparent
need of greater energy in the Crimea, and the
exceedingly severe comments of the press, to a state
of great excitement. Questions were poured in upon
the Ministry, like a torrent. The Premier was holden
responsible not only for <hi rend="italics">what</hi> he said, but <hi rend="italics">how</hi> he said
it, and for honourable members <hi rend="italics">laughing</hi> or <hi rend="italics">crying</hi> at
what he said. It was indeed a most difficult time. A
firm, strong, steady hand at helm was needed. Reform
must be brought about, the war must be carried on,
negotiations must be conducted, despondency must
be driven from some minds, the doubtful must be
assured—in short, all classes made all manner of
demands, and the Opposition took all manner of
advantage of the crisis. It was
<pb id="ward316" n="316"/>
most interesting, on the 23rd of March, 1855, to see
Lord Palmerston, a man of seventy, with the
appearance of a man of fifty, at midnight as if it were
but noon, keep his place, meet the Opposition, endure
the public grumbling, maintain a cheerful face, and, by
his indefatigable industry and unwearied attention to
public business, conduct the nation through storms
and perils in the midst of which, while many found
fault and loudly complained, few dared, none could,
take his place and do his work. I know not of a more
interesting occasion to see Lord Palmerston and hear
him speak, than that. One seldom has an opportunity
of seeing such a Prime Minister in such circumstances.
I shall always remember that night. And, now that
Sebastopol is captured, the English press lauds Lord
Palmerston. St. Clare said, he judged of Aunt Dinah's
cooking “as men judge of generals—by their
successes.” So is Lord Palmerston now judged by
those who, at the time I saw him, could condemn and
distrust the Premier, but could neither govern the
country nor remedy defects.</p>
            <p>It was in June, 1853, that I was in the House of
Peers. If I was fortunate in the other House, two years
after, I was more fortunate at the time I mention. It was
during “the season,” and before the war—
so that many Lords were in attendance,
<pb id="ward317" n="317"/>
and local matters of legislation occupied
their attention. Lord Shaftesbury, with his natural
kindness, met me at the door of one of the passages,
and conducted me to the standing place (none but
Peers, not even Ambassadors, <hi rend="italics">sit</hi> in the House of
Lords), and pointed out to me the several Peers and
Bishops. The Earl Waldegrave left his seat, to come
and shake my hand. The Duke of Argyll gave me his
recognition. I was so fortunate as to hear the Lord
Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice, the Duke of Argyll,
the Earl of Harrowby, the Earl of Aberdeen, Lord Grey,
Lord Kinnaird, Lord Brougham, Lord Lyndhurst, the
Earl of Clarendon, and the Earl of Shaftesbury. Such a
display of senatorial talent one seldom has the good
fortune to witness. But illustrious as were the names of
those I heard, eloquent as were their speeches—and
mortal men never spoke more eloquently than Lord
Grey and Lord Brougham—the subject of these
speeches, and the conclusion to which their Lordships
came, interested me far more. After the disposal of
some petitions, and other matters of routine, Lord
Lyndhurst asked a question of Lord Clarendon
concerning the position and intentions of Russia, in
the Danubian Principalities. The noble Secretary
answered the question to the satisfaction of the great
Ex-Lord Chancellor, and then came on the business of
the day. Lord Redesdale
<pb id="ward318" n="318"/>
took the chair, as the House went into Committee, and
his Lordship is Chairman of Committee. The order of
the day was Lord Shaftesbury's Juvenile Mendicant
Bill. The Lord Chancellor made a speech against it;
the Lord Chief Justice did the same. Lord Shaftesbury
calmly sat in his place while these attacks were made.
Soon after, the Bill was defended by the noble Premier
(Lord Aberdeen) and the Duke of Argyll. Lord Grey
made a most eloquent speech in its favour. Lord
Harrowby brought to its defence the weight of his
great name. Then uprose the Earl of Shaftesbury in
defence of his Bill, meeting the objections of the Lord
Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice, utterly refusing
to withdraw the Bill, from a sense of duty to his God
and to his fellow men, and declaring that, “from the
opposition it had received from the two legal Lords,
he had made up his mind that its fate was sealed; but
the responsibility of its being lost must rest upon their
Lordships, and not upon him.”</p>
            <p>The earnestness, the eloquence, with which this
speech was delivered, commanded universal
attention. It showed that the great prince of British
beneficence was a statesman as well as a
philanthropist: it showed that a honest manly sense of
Christian responsibility controlled him in the senate as
well as in the Ragged School: it was quite
<pb id="ward319" n="319"/>
consistent with the reputation he had earned when a
member of the House of Commons, devoting himself
like a Howard to the welfare of the neglected, and to
the removal of the abuses which crushed them: and it
gave me, who had learned to venerate him, the
unspeakable satisfaction of seeing the most decided
abolitionist in the House of Lords one of its most
influential members; for, after he sat down, in less than
twenty minutes the Lord Chief Justice and the Lord
Chancellor gave in their adhesion to the Bill, Lord
Brougham spoke in its favour, and it passed
unanimously. I could not help congratulating Lord
Shaftesbury upon his success, and he accepted the
compliment kindly.</p>
            <p>Now, what was that Bill? for <hi rend="italics">that</hi> it was which
impressed me with inexpressible admiration of the
British peerage. The title of the Bill indicates the class
to whom it relates. Its objects, briefly, were, to arrest
the mendicant children of London, whose parents
compel them to beg for a living. These parents neither
support, nor educate, nor in any other way care for
their children, but compel them to obtain money by
begging or stealing. The consequence is, that these
children are what Lord Shaftesbury called “a seedplot
of crime”; for, in the great majority of cases, they
become the worst description of criminals. The Bill
provided for the
<pb id="ward320" n="320"/>
arrest of these children, and placing them under the
care of proper persons, to educate and teach them
some honest way of earning a livelihood. I think it also
provided some punishment or fine upon the parents.
The debate, therefore, which engaged the most
learned and the most eloquent, as well as those
highest in rank, in the House of Peers, both in the
Ministry and out of it, was upon the question, What
shall be done with the mendicant children of the
British Metropolis? On both sides, the most tender
pity and the most anxious solicitude for these poor
children was constantly expressed. The greatest point
of difficulty was, to settle how far the legislature could
interfere, consistently with the rights of the parties
concerned. In the course of the debate a noble
Marquis asked—“My Lords, who is to be the judge as
to whether these parents perform their duty, or not?
and if not, who is to assume their place, and act in
their stead?” In his peculiarly graceful and easy
manner, the Lord Chief Justice arose and replied, “I
beg to answer the noble Lord by reminding him that
the constitution puts the Lord Chancellor <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">in loco
parentis</foreign></hi> to the neglected and deserted children of
England.”</p>
            <p>The subject of the discussion, and the result of it—
the personages engaged in it, and the spirit in which
they addressed themselves to it—filled me with such a
sense of admiration for that senate, as
<pb id="ward321" n="321"/>
I cannot express. The House of Lords, discussing their
duties towards the lowest classes of Her Majesty's
subjects! The rights of those classes, though
criminals, as adults, and though mendicants, as
children, seemed, to me, most delicately handled! The
Lord Chief Justice, speaking both as a peer and a
judge, saying that his fellow peer, the Lord Chancellor,
is the guardian, the constitutional guardian, of these
children of poverty and crime! The yielding of that
noble House to the eloquent suasion of one of
humanity's great British ornaments, the poor man's
great model friend, the Earl of Shaftesbury! All these
ideas crowded so upon my bewildered brain, that I
was excited almost beyond endurance. It gave me
such ideas of the British legislature and the British
constitution, that I felt more than ever grateful to God
that it is my lot, and the lot of my children, to be and
remain subjects of the British Crown.</p>
            <p>How different was all this from what was true of my
unhappy native country! There, the poorest of the
poor are sold in the shambles. There, honourable
senators are but too anxious to avoid legislating in
their behalf: there, alas! legislation is chiefly devoted
to rivetting the chains that bind them. More of
American legislation is devoted to the promotion of
slavery, directly and indirectly, than to any other
interest whatever! <hi rend="italics">Rights of the</hi>
<pb id="ward322" n="322"/>
<hi rend="italics">poorest, in America!</hi> why, one half of the time of
American senators is spent in declaring what are the
rights of all men, and the other half in depriving the
poorest, the most outraged, those needing the most
protection from the legislature, of all rights!</p>
            <p>Besides, I should not dare visit the capital of
my native country. It is in slaveholding territory;
and there I could be legally arrested either as a
runaway slave, or, if it were after ten at night, as
a Negro at large without permission. In the latter
case, I must pay £2 fine, or be severely flogged the
next morning; in the former, I should be advertised.
If no one came forward to prove me a freeman, 
or claim me as a slave, I should be sold to
pay jail fees. But I had been in the British senate
at the invitation of one of its most influential
members; I had received from him marked attention;
and I had seen him triumphantly carry what was
to him a favourite measure, a measure having for
its object the suppression and prevention of crime,
and benefiting and blessing the poor. Who can
blame a Negro for loving Great Britain? Who
wonders that we are among the most loyal of Her  
Majesty's subjects?</p>
            <p>In June, 1853, the Rev. T. Binney honoured me with
an invitation to be present at the annual examination
and dinner, at the Grammar School at
<pb id="ward323" n="323"/>

Hindley, Esq., M.P., gave the toast upon civil and
religious liberty, and in a kind and complimentary
speech introduced me, as having been appointed to
respond to it.</p>
            <p>In June 1854 I was honoured with an invitation,
through the kindness of James Spicer, Esq.,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref33" n="33" rend="sc" target="note33">†</ref><note id="note33" n="33" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref33"><p>† A gentleman to whom I am under many great obligations.</p></note> to dine
with the Company of Fishmongers. It there also fell to
my lot to respond to the toast on civil and religious
liberty.</p>
            <p>My excellent friend Charles Makins, Esq., has on
several occasions made me his guest at dinner parties,
and I had to reply to the complimentary toasts to
Canada, speaking in behalf of my North American
fellow subjects; or to respond to the toast on the royal
family, thus setting forth our Canadian loyalty.</p>
            <p>Having intended and hoped to leave England in the
latter part of the last year, the Chairman of the
Congregational Union of England and Wales, the
Rev. A. Morton Brown, LL.D, kindly and publicly
took leave of me, in behalf of the body, in a speech
full of the generous feeling wherewith his great heart
abounds—such as he has always shown me
<pb id="ward324" n="324"/>
at his house, in his pulpit, on the platform, and
wherever it has been my good fortune to meet him.</p>
            <p>But I cannot give one in a hundred of the incidents
which made impressions of the most lasting kind upon
me, during my sojourn in England. One chapter I
thought must be devoted to them, and that chapter
must soon close. Those I have mentioned, I am sure,
serve to demonstrate my most grateful sense of
obligation to the many kind persons to whom I am
indebted. I am equally sure that omissions will not be
set down to a want of courtesy. But why write this
chapter at all? For the purpose of stating, in
connection with it, some two or three things by way of
inference, and for the purpose of saying one word for
myself.</p>
            <p>1. For myself I only wish to say, that wherever I
went, I always recollected that I was the
representative of my people, and received in that light
all the tokens of respect which were kindly given me.
Not that I was ungrateful, but that I very well knew
none of these kind feelings were expressed on my own
account, stranger as I was, but on account of those
whose cause I bear in my person and advocate in my
public labours.</p>
            <p>2. I mention these incidents as so many proofs
that the abolitionism of England is not confined to
any one class. It is an individual as well as a national
matter. When the Duchess of Sutherland
<pb id="ward325" n="325"/>
told me she had received abusive letters from
American slaveholders, I could but see that English
abolitionists, of whatever rank, suffer for the slave as
well as feel for him a kind sympathy. When her Grace
honoured me with an introduction to her daughter,
Lady Kildare, who is, like her mother, an abolitionist,
and when I saw the Duchess of Argyll evince so much
of deep feeling for the slave, I said to myself, “the
Duchess of Sutherland suffers abuse for us, but that
does not induce her to abandon the cause: so far from
it, she brings up her daughters to labour and suffer for
it, thus giving it the influence of illustrious rank and
exalted position.” So, when I knew that Samuel
Morley, Eusebius Smith, Ernest Bunsen, Charles
Makins, Wilson Armestead, George Hitchcock, James
Spicer, and Samuel Horman-Fisher, Esqs., were
abolitionists, in spite of opposition, and at large
expense to their pocket, I hailed with delight the fact
that their principles were personal matters, deeply felt,
fully considered, intelligently chosen, and, of course,
firmly held. This is not the sort of Englishmen who
become pro-slavery men upon going to America.
Such degeneracy is only true of those whose
abolitionism is mere sentimentality at home, and
therefore good for nothing abroad. They only <hi rend="italics">drifted</hi>
with the current, here, in one direction; and they <hi rend="italics">drift</hi>
with it, there, in the
<pb id="ward326" n="326"/>
opposite direction: it is <hi rend="italics">drifting,</hi> and nothing more, in
either case. Contending against the stream, in either
country, is no work of theirs. But those whom I have
named above, and all like them, were just the persons
to free the British slave, when that was to be done—to
feel, labour, and pray for the American slave, now, and
to prove themselves true practical friends to the
British Negro at all times.</p>
            <p>3. I wish to follow in the footsteps of Mrs. Stowe, in
recording my humble testimony to an important fact, in
contradiction to an oft-repeated observation in
America, concerning the British nobility in particular,
and British abolitionists generally. The assertion is,
that while these persons are earnest and untiring in
their advocacy of the cause of the Negro, they pay no
attention to, but actually trample upon, the poor of
their own country, who are close to their doors. That
is the American <hi rend="italics">assertion;</hi> the <hi rend="italics">fact</hi> is just contrary to it.
Mrs. Stowe wrote her “Sunny Memories” on purpose
to dissipate this false though prevalent opinion in
America, and I honour her for it. Her book has been
severely criticized, and it is open to criticism; perhaps I
have indulged in criticism as freely (though not with
hostility) as any one: but the motive with which it was
written was most honourable. I write this chapter with
a like motive.
<pb id="ward327" n="327"/>
The Earl of Shaftesbury and the Duchess of
Sutherland are most widely known as the most
prominent anti-slavery personages among the
nobility. They, of all their rank, do most to ameliorate
the condition of England's poor. Her Grace has
educated her daughters in the activities to which she
has devoted so much of her own time: those
daughters are among the most active and devoted
aristocratic patronesses of the charities of England
which seek the elevation and relieve the wants of
many of the poorest, at home.</p>
            <p>The same remark applies to Joseph Payne, Esq., and
all others amongst the middle classes who <hi rend="italics">work</hi> in the
anti-slavery cause in England: they are those who
<hi rend="italics">work</hi> most in the great plans of local benevolence
which abound in this country. No colonist has spent
so much time among these persons, at their work, as
myself; and I have enjoyed opportunities of testifying
to the truth touching the matter, to which many are
strangers. I take the greatest pleasure in doing what in
me lies to disabuse honest persons who have been
misled. Those who choose to make a false assertion
for the sake of disparaging Englishmen, do not care to
be informed: indeed, they would rather cling to their
error. Such, of course, I cannot hope to convince.</p>
            <p>4. The anti-slavery men of England are among the
most prominent of her great Dissenting Protestants.
<pb id="ward328" n="328"/>
The mention of such names as I have had the
honour of recording, names of men whose praises are
in all the Churches, is abundant proof of this. I regard
it as an evidence of God's great favour to our cause, as
I have said before; and take very great pleasure in
assuring these beloved brethren that the great mass of
American abolitionists, and those of Canada, are of
“like precious faith.” They rely upon the gospel, as the
great effective means of success. Those who think and
act otherwise are a very small and diminishing number.
They are not the men who either have or deserve the
confidence or the co-operation of Christian
abolitionists on either side of the Atlantic. I may
perhaps, however, be allowed to say, that there is, in
my humble judgment, great danger that pro-slavery
professors of religion from America will receive too
much countenance from British abolitionists. I think
the co-operation with and indorsement of the
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign
Missions is a most undesirable step, in that direction.
In that Board there is not a man, I believe, who has
ever opened his mouth for the slave. As a Board, they
have ignored the anti-slavery question, or allowed
slaveholders to be appointed missionaries (as in the
case of Rev. Mr. Wilson), or provided for and winked
at the admission of slaveholders into their Mission
<pb id="ward329" n="329"/>
Churches, as in the case of the Cherokees and the
Choctaws. Slaveholders, from one end of the country
to the other, are members and officers of it; and the
most decided pro-slavery men of the North are its chief
promoters. That it should find indorsement in England,
among Christian abolitionists, is especially to be
deplored. Let but pro-slavery men, and 
slavery-sanctioning organizations, in America, be 
recognized and treated in this country <hi rend="italics">according to their
character at home,</hi>and they would soon feel
compelled to alter their course. While they can obtain
the approval of men in this country whose opinions
they very well know how to value, they are
encouraged to continue in their present attitude. Is this
desirable on the part of British anti-slavery men? Can
they better aid the cause of the slave than by
sustaining its friends in America, and rebuking its
enemies by their mighty moral power?</p>

            <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
            <head>SCOTLAND.</head>
            <p>MANY of the most prominent members of the
Anti-Slavery Society of Canada are natives of
Scotland. Knowing the very active part some of the
very best of their countrymen took in the
emancipation struggle, and knowing as well how
warmly the Scottish heart beats for liberty, especially
upon its native soil, they kindly gave me letters of
introduction to many persons of great eminence there.
After I arrived in England, the Committee of the
Glasgow New Abolition Society very cordially invited
me to visit the North. What I knew of Scotchmen
whom I had met, what I had read, and the natural
desire to see such a country and such a people, made
me but too happy to accept their kind invitation.
Accordingly, in October, 1853, I paid my first visit to
the land of Bruce and Burns, of Campbell, Gordon, and
Scott. I was invited to attend a bazaar, and to speak.
Though very ill, I made the attempt. The Rev. Dr.
Lorimer was in the chair, sustained by some of the
most learned of the
<pb id="ward331" n="331"/>
Glasgow clergy, and gentlemen of high standing in
other professions.</p>
            <p>The kind and, I am sure, too partial manner, in
which the excellent Dr. Roberton, of Manchester, had
written and spoken of me, made me the welcome guest
of Captain Hamilton,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref34" n="34" rend="sc" target="note34">*</ref><note id="note34" n="34" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref34"><p>* Captain Hamilton did me the honour to introduce me to Rev. Mr.
Monro, of Rutherglen, whose kind people contributed most liberally to our
cause.</p></note> of Rutherglen—a fit
representative of the Scottish laird and the British
officer. William P. Paton, Esq., and Hugh Brown, Esq.,
laid me under obligations by kindly receiving me at
their homes, and by introducing me to some of the
most eminent Scottish ministers. It was at the house of
the former that I first had the gratification of meeting
the Rev. Dr. Urwick, of Dublin, and the Rev. Noble
Shepherd, of Sligo. At the house of Mr. Brown I had
the pleasure of meeting the Rev. Dr. Arnot. At the
hospitable board of the Rev. Dr. Lorimer I was
honoured by an introduction to the Rev. Dr. Robson.
Through the kindness of another friend, John Bain,
Esq., I had the privilege of becoming acquainted with
the Rev. Dr. Roxburgh.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref35" n="35" rend="sc" target="note35">†</ref><note id="note35" n="35" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref35"><p>† Dr. Roxburgh invited me to preach for him, and kindly allowed me to

like a brother, and Mrs. Smith sustained him in it.
David Smith, Esq.,
<pb id="ward332" n="332"/>
the elder brother of Mr. John Smith, conferred upon
me one of the highest favours a Scotchman could
confer or a Negro could appreciate—<hi rend="italics">he gave me a copy
of Burns' poems,</hi> from his own library. That was
almost equal to proffering me the freedom of Glasgow,
or making me a Scotchman! Well did I use that
volume, while sojourning in the country which gave
birth to it and its immortal author! O that I liked <hi rend="italics">oaten
cakes, haggis, cockie-leekie, or</hi> BAGPIPES, as much as
Burns! May my Scotch brethren forgive me for being
so incorrigible a creature as to cling to old-fashioned
likes and dislikes, acquired before I went to Scotland!</p>
            <p>I have been speaking of my first visit to Scotland,
in 1853. I was there again in May, 1855, and have
therefore seen Scotland in winter and in May. The
former taught me, almost as well as a Canadian winter,
what Thomson meant when he said,
<q direct="unspecified"><l>“In Winter, awful Thou!”</l></q>
It was a cold, damp, foggy winter—a winter of such
“darkness as may be felt.” I had before heard that “a
Scotch mist will wet an Irishman to the skin.” A
Scotch fog went <hi rend="italics">through</hi> my skin, and gave me a
worse congestion of the lungs than I had before
suffered from in twenty years. So severe was it, as to
compel me to suspend labour, and return to England. I
went to the coast of
<pb id="ward333" n="333"/>
Kent, to recover; and while there, received an
invitation from my honoured friend, William
Crossfield, Esq., to spend some time at his very
pleasant residence, near Liverpool. In the course of a
month I was able to resume my labours. Thanks to my
kind hostess, Miss Jurdison, of Ramsgate; to the very
amiable family of Mr. Crossfield, and other numerous
friends in Liverpool, including Rev. Dr. Raffles, J.
Cropper, Esq., E. Cropper, Esq., Rev. Chas. Birrell, G.
Wright, Esq., the Misses Wraith, and others! Their
great kindness did more than medicine towards my
restoration.</p>
            <p>I saw a good deal of Scotland, however, that winter,
and became acquainted with some of the very best
classes of Scotch gentry. I met, and worshipped with,
and preached for, some of the best congregations—as
Rev. Mr. Munro's, of Rutherglen; Rev. Dr. Wardlaw's,
Rev. Dr. Roxburgh and others, in Glasgow; Rev. Mr.
Campbell's and Rev. Dr. Alexander's, in Edinburgh;
Rev. Mr. Gilfillan's, Rev. Mr. Lang's, and Rev. Mr.
Borwick's, of Dundee; Rev. Dr. Brown's, of Dalkeith;
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>I was in Scotland, alas! too late to see the Rev. Dr.
Wardlaw. I had received from him kind, loving
messages of sympathy, fraternity, and encouragement.
They came like the words of one just entering the
world of love—were destitute of stiff formality, and
fragrant with the spirit of
<pb id="ward334" n="334"/>
heaven. On an appointed day, a party of us went to
his residence, to see him. The carriage which
conveyed me arrived just as others were leaving, and
the fatigue of the interview could neither be prolonged
nor repeated. Thus I lost the opportunity of seeing on
earth one of the men to meet whom will be one of the
attractions of heaven. I had been equally
unsuccessful in seeing Dr. Collyer, the first day I
preached in his chapel. Before I was there again, he
and the sainted Wardlaw were with Jesus.</p>
            <p>I had the melancholy pleasure of mingling my tears
with the many who heard Rev. Dr. Alexander preach
Dr. Wardlaw's funeral sermon. I never before heard
such a discourse. It was a noble tribute to the learning,
piety, attainments and character, of the deceased, by
one who intimately knew him and dearly loved him.
The oration spoke wonders both for the dead and the
living. It showed that the living speaker knew how to
appreciate the great and shining qualities of the
deceased. The sermon was delivered in the earnest
impressive style of Scotch divines, tempered and
chastened by the superior refinement of the respected
preacher, who is, I think, one of the most finished—if
not, indeed, <hi rend="italics">the</hi> most finished—pulpit orator I heard in
Scotland.</p>
            <p>The deep sensation felt all through the commercial
<pb id="ward335" n="335"/>
metropolis of Scotland upon the death of Dr.
Wardlaw, the words of praise which every lip gave
him, the reverence with which his name was spoken,
testified plainly, to the most casual observer, how
deep and firm a hold he had upon all hearts while
living. The same feeling pervaded all classes in the
provinces. In his case was verified the scriptural
expression, “The memory of the just is blessed.”</p>
            <p>Society in Scotland differs from that in England,
as does the society of Boston and Massachusetts
generally from that of Vermont, New Hampshire,
and Maine. I was struck with this while travelling
northwards. The northern people are more familiar,
more democratic. A Scotchman does not feel under
the particular necessity of sitting next you all day
in a railway carriage <hi rend="italics">without saying a word,</hi> as an
Englishman does. Betwixt different classes there
is more familiarity, less distance, in Scotland, than
in England. The different orders of society seem
to approach more nearly to each other, without
either losing or forgetting its place. There is less
of the feeling, so prevalent in small towns in the
South, that merchants and professional men must
by all means avoid contact with shopkeepers. The
chief order of nobility is the clergy, and all join to
pay deference to them; but the general spread of
religion, and the very upright and pious habits of
the population—the familiarity of the ministers with
<pb id="ward336" n="336"/>
people, join to produce a brotherly feeling of oneness,
which is abundantly apparent in the national character
and in the state of society.</p>
            <p>Besides, I do not think that mere ceremony is half
so much studied by the Scotch. They are great
believers in realities; they are a substantial people;
and what is merely formal, unless it be formal after the
Scottish mode, is not commendable to them, and it
costs them but little to say, “I canna be fashed wi sic
clishmaclaver.” Hence, you get at a Scotchman's
heart at once. He will not profess to be what he is not.
When you go to his house, and he extends his hand
and says, “Come away,” you may know you are
welcome. I like this straightforward way of doing
things: it is far more expressive of true generosity than
the set courtly phrases of mere conventionalism.</p>
            <p>A sort of independence of character is far more
prevalent and observable in the Scotch peasantry
than in either the English, the Irish, or the Welsh.
Everybody expects to find it so; if not he will find
himself much mistaken. Several anecdotes have been
given me illustrative of this; but as I am not at home in
telling Scotch tales, I dare not insert any of them. The
fact, however, is most palpable. Doubtless the
universal diffusion of education has much to do with
it.</p>
            <p>How readily, and how generously, did the Scottish
<pb id="ward337" n="337"/>
people respond to the claims of the anti-slavery
cause! Dr. Pennington found it so, when he was
there; so did Mr. Garnet; so did Frederic Douglass.
There is far more of active, organized, anti-slavery
vitality, among the three millions of Scottish
population, than among the seventeen millions of
English people. There are classes in England
which the anti-slavery cause never reaches—the
classes who compose the multitude. It is not so in
Scotland, because the whole population, high and
low, attend divine service, and they naturally enough
acquire the habit of attending the kirk on any subject
for which it is open. In England, millions of the
working classes (not to mention others) do not attend
any place of worship, and therefore never hear, know,
or care, about the moral movements of the age. The
same result is seen in Ireland. There are multitudes
there, to be seen in the streets, who never enter any
other than a Roman Catholic place of worship, and
who accordingly know literally nothing of what is
going on in the great moral field. In Wales, on the
other hand, religion is as universal as education is in
Scotland. Hence the Welsh, like the Scotch, go <hi rend="italics">en
masse</hi> to the meetings for religious and benevolent
purposes.</p>
            <p>As I travelled about Scotland, both in 1853 and
1855, I found the anti-slavery feeling prevalent, deep,
earnest, and intelligent. It is incorporated
<pb id="ward338" n="338"/>
in the feelings, habits, and characteristics of the
people. They are abolitionists from intelligent
conviction, human sympathy, and religious principle.
Anti-slavery principle will live in Scotland while
religion has an abiding place in the hearts of her
people. I attended meetings in Glasgow, Edinburgh,
Dalkeith, Dunfermline, Dundee, Hamilton, Stewartown,
Cumnock, Kirkaldy, Falkirk, Stirling, Montrose,
Rutherglen, Greenock, Rothsay, Campbelltown, 
&amp;c. To the kind friends in those towns whose humble
guest I had the pleasure of being (in one case, when
suffering from an affection of the chest and an
inflammation in my feet; in another, when on crutches
from a severe lameness—circumstances which made
kindness the more needed and the more acceptable), I
beg hereby to tender my most hearty thanks. May the
blessings of those ready to perish ever be upon them!</p>
            <p>In Glasgow there are two Anti-Slavery Committees.
My immediate connection was with the new one; but
Mrs. George Smith, one of the old Committee, with
whom I had the pleasure of breakfasting, is most
catholic in her anti-slavery views and feelings. To the
slave and his cause she is true, however she may
differ from some of her coadjutors. I did not happen to
meet any other person in Glasgow whom I knew as
belonging to the old Society. It was not my business
to inquire
<pb id="ward339" n="339"/>
into the differences of abolitionists, but I presume
they are about the same as those between anti-slavery
people in the United States. Would that the time were
come, when all Christians and all Christian reformers
were prepared to say, “Let there be no strife, I pray
thee, between thee and me, and between my herdmen
and thy herdmen, for we be brethren.” How much do
we all need to study the lesson taught us by our Lord,
in his reply to the disciples, when they informed him
that they had forbidden some one to cast out devils,
because he did not follow with them!</p>
            <p>In other towns, I believe, this division happily does
not exist. There is a very active society in Edinburgh,
whose Secretary, Mrs. Wigham, treated me most
kindly, inviting and introducing me to a meeting of the
Ladies' Committee.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref36" n="36" rend="sc" target="note36">*</ref><note id="note36" n="36" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref36"><p>* Mrs. Wigham sent her carriage to my hotel, to fetch me to breakfast
with her family. There I had the pleasure of making Mr. Wigham's acquaintance.</p></note> That Society, as such, allowed me
to be the bearer of a very generous donation to those
who sent me hither. They also gave me a token of kind
wishes to myself personally. In Dundee is an earnest,
energetic Society, whose Secretary, Mrs. Borwick, is
indefatigable in its promotion. That Society also gave
me tangible expressions of personal regard, and of
sympathy with my cause, on both occasions
<pb id="ward340" n="340"/>
of my visiting Dundee. In Greenock a Committee was
formed while I was there, from which great good may
be expected, because at its head is a lady<ref targOrder="U" id="ref37" n="37" rend="sc" target="note37">*</ref><note id="note37" n="37" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref37"><p>* Mrs. Hepburn.</p></note> of such
untiring energy, that her efforts will effect a great deal.
With her are associated so many of the truly pious
and benevolent of that beautiful town, that there will
be no lack of service to the general cause from that
very efficient Committee.</p>
            <p>The Glasgow Society is the leading one, from its
position, and the commanding influence of most of its
members. Glasgow is the chief place of business north
of the Tweed. Its commerce is constantly increasing;
and its “merchant princes” and “factory lords” are
augmenting their wealth, and that of their town, to an
almost incredible degree. Hence, whatever is done in
Glasgow is done for the whole of Scotland. The
influence of Glasgow merchants and Glasgow
ministers is considerable, owing to the greatness of
this Queen of the West, and to the personal character
and great learning which those ministers possess.
These two facts, with the additional one that both
merchants and ministers are members of the Glasgow
Society, make it to all practical purposes a Society for
all Scotland, as it might not improperly be called. Then,
the very fraternal co-operation with it which the 
Anti-Slavery Societies and the ministers and
<pb id="ward341" n="341"/>
Churches of the whole country show, certainly makes
it a national more than a local organization. It <hi rend="italics">is</hi>
national, in fact, but it is the nationality of sympathy
and co-operation, which is far better than that of mere
name.</p>
            <p>There is much in Scotland, especially in Glasgow, for
the anti-slavery cause to contend against. There is a
great deal of trade between Glasgow merchants and
American traders. The former do not like to run the risk
of damaging their business, by offending good
customers—which they fear would be the result of
their taking active, open, anti-slavery ground. This is
less commendable, as some of the most prosperous,
most successful firms, are anti-slavery men—a fact
which certainly ought to assure the timid. But timidity is
not all. They are not only “fearful,” but “unbelieving.”
They are <hi rend="italics">not,</hi> in heart, <hi rend="italics">with</hi> the anti-slavery cause; but
they <hi rend="italics">are,</hi> in heart, <hi rend="italics">against</hi> it. I could mention the names
of more than one Lord Provost who refused,
a when in office, to show the least favour to our
cause, because they did not approve of it. They are
merchants, and look at things as Mr. Cunard does,
“in a business light;” but why it should injure them
more than it does Messrs. Campbells, G. Smith and
Sons, McKeand and Co., Playfair and Bryce, Messrs.
Smith, or Mr. W. P. Paton, all of whom are
abolitionists, and merchants too, <hi rend="italics">I dinna ken.</hi></p>
            <pb id="ward342" n="342"/>
            <p>Some few of the clergymen, too, it is not to be
denied, seem destitute of all interest in the cause
of the slave. Then there are some who were
formerly slaveholders in the colonies, and whose
being obliged to release their Negroes did not at all
change their hearts. But what in this world could
have made a pro-slavery man of Mr. Baxter, M.P.
for Montrose, I cannot imagine. His father was
among the most ready to forward the cause which
first took me to Dundee. His venerable grandfather,
one of the princely patriarchs of Scotland, took me
kindly by the hand, and made the largest contribution,
save one, that I received in Scotland to the
cause. I bowed with him at the altar of prayer;
we united our supplications together: it was 
eight-and-forty hours after the demise of Dr. Wardlaw,
whom the venerable William Baxter soon joined, in
heaven. I have his autograph. It is doubly dear
to me since his decease. Loving him as I did, I
could but feel the deepest regret that a cause to
which he was so ardently attached should be
wounded by one in whose veins flowed the blood
of William Baxter!</p>
            <p>In Edinburgh I found a warm coadjutor in the
person of the excellent Rev. J. R. Campbell, M.A.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref38" n="38" rend="sc" target="note38">*</ref>
<note id="note38" n="38" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref38"><p>* Now of Bradford, Yorkshire.</p></note>The Rev. Dr. Candlish put himself to some
inconvenience to attend my meeting there. Mr.
Joseph
<pb id="ward343" n="343"/>
Watson, John Wigham, Esq., Mr. Thomas Russell, and
the Rev. Geo. Cullen of Leith, gave me very substantial
proofs of their friendly regard for the cause of my poor
people. J. B. Tod, Esq., and his amiable family, made
their house my home, and a most delightful home it
was. Mr. Tod is one of the earliest abolitionists of
Scotland. He was warm and devoted in the cause, in
days when some were opposing, others doubting and
hesitating. Mr. John Dunlop, of Burntisland, was an
anti-slavery man in those days too. He sacrificed a
small fortune in the cause, rather than retain the
ownership of human beings. A more cordial friend the
anti-slavery cause has not in Scotland, than John
Dunlop, Esq.</p>
            <p>Much excitement prevailed throughout Scotland in
May, 1855, owing to the fact that the missionaries of
the United Presbyterian Church had admitted
slaveholders to the communion and membership of the
body, at Old Calabar, in Africa. The arguments <hi rend="italics">pro</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">con.</hi> showed that the question of the religious
character of slaveholders, and of their fitness for
fellowship in a Christian Church, was one in which the
denomination took a deep interest. Members of other
bodies as well shared in the interest excited by this
discussion. Without professing to understand the
matter in its length and breadth, I feel quite sure that
the honest disposition of all is, to arrive at the truth
<pb id="ward344" n="344"/>
and to practise it. This is an earnest, not only of
present right-mindedness, but of future success in
grappling with the difficulties of the case, and
overcoming them: as they must be, if the body be kept
pure. The same honoured denomination is doing very
much to evangelize Jamaica. No doubt their interest in
the cause of the Negro will continue, while they are
engaged in doing so much for his very best weal. It is
to that body that my eloquent cousin, Rev. H. H.
Garnet, of Westmoreland, county of Cornwall,
Jamaica, belongs.</p>
            <p>While I was in Edinburgh, I gladly accepted the kind
offer of Mrs. Tod and her accomplished daughter, to
accompany me to Holyrood House. I had read so
much of that palace, and had made myself so familiar
with the history of Mary, Queen of Scots, and her
unhappy husbands (to accommodate <sic corr="oneself">onesself</sic> to a
term not strictly correct), that I was anxious to visit it.
Mrs. Tod is an Irish lady—whether of the old school
or not, I cannot say; but of the school of kind
politeness, refined manners, well stored intellect, and
extraordinary conversational powers, with an
abundance to converse about of that which is far
above mere commonplace parlance. Her daughter,
though born in Scotland, of a Scottish father, is to all
appearance and to all purposes an Irish girl, in all that
is good, accomplished, ladylike, and simple-hearted,
which
<pb id="ward345" n="345"/>
that term includes. With such companions, and a
succession of servants to show us over the different
apartments, we took our <hi rend="italics">tour</hi> of Holyrood House—for it
is no small journey—and were first shown into the
room in which King James is <hi rend="italics">said</hi> to have been born.
Our guide (as, unfortunately, is not very uncommon
with such officials, in that country) was in a state that
would pass among ordinary judges for drunk. He made
some stupid blunder about the lock of the door, so
that he could not unfasten it to let us out. There we
were—Mrs. Tod, Miss Tod, our guide, and myself—
locked in the room in which, he said, James the Sixth of
Scotland and First of England was born! Imprisoned in
Holyrood House! After the far less than sober guide
had exercised his skill upon the door, the lock, and the
key, sufficiently to convince us that he could never
release us, I took an old battle-axe, affirmed to be 600
years old (everything is ancient in such places,
according to the chronology of guides and servants),
and broke the door open, effecting deliverance from
durance for myself and party.</p>
            <p>We were shown Queen Mary's bed, some tapestry
of her own working, and a thousand and one
curiosities connected with that unhappy woman,
which every visitor of Holyrood has had pointed out
to him, in her apartments. The fabulous blood of
Rizzio was shown us, of course; what was it
<pb id="ward346" n="346"/>
kept there for, but to be shown? But the most
amusing thing was pointing out the stone, on the
floor of the ruined abbey, where Queen Mary stood
when <hi rend="italics">she was married to Bothwell!</hi> That was a little
“more than I had bargained for”; I therefore said to
the person who showed it—“Will you be kind enough,
first to tell me <hi rend="italics">when</hi> she was married to Bothwell, or,
whether she was married to him or not? We will see
the stone they <hi rend="italics">stood upon when married,
afterwards.”</hi></p>
            <p>“There is, I confess, some doubt about it, in some
minds, sir,” he remarked apologetically.</p>
            <p>“And I am one of the most sceptical,” said I. The
ladies laughed, and the guide kept better
“within the record” after that.</p>
            <p>Going over the apartments recently occupied by
the royal family, I was delighted to see the simplicity
and plainness of the furniture in the bedrooms. The
bedsteads of the princes were just such as Masters
Anybody in the kingdom would sleep on. In the royal
apartments, which the person who showed them told
us were not exhibited to <hi rend="italics">all</hi> visitors (hinting both that
we were privileged and that we ought to pay for it), I
saw two elegant chairs, which were brought from
Montreal to the Exhibition of 1851. I was charged with
being so delighted with these productions of my own
colony, as to almost forget everything else I saw;
<pb id="ward347" n="347"/>
and the charge, I must acknowledge, is more than half
true. It was no small gratification, to know that one's
own colony was well and honourably represented in
that Exhibition, and to know that the royal family
honoured that colony either by the purchase or the
acceptance of those articles, and caused them to be
placed in the ancient palace of Holyrood.</p>
            <p>When at Stirling and Perth, I was so lame as to be
unable either to walk about or ride on horseback; and
was therefore obliged to leave both places without
seeing their great beauties, and their points of almost
classic interest. This was, to me, a matter of deep
regret; but, indulging the hope of visiting Scotland at
some future day, with my family, I contented myself
with the promise of then seeing the lakes, the
highlands, the midsummer twilight of the far North, the
city of Aberdeen, and the beautiful scenery
surrounding Stirling and Perth. I was equally
disappointed at Hamilton, Greenock, and Rothsay; but
fortunate enough to receive the kind sympathy, active
and hearty co-operation, and personal kindness, of the
good friends of the cause in those towns.</p>
            <p>I forgot to say, that the Glasgow New Abolition
Society has a Committee of Ladies as well as one of
gentlemen. These two, while somewhat independent,
yet act together. It was my privilege to be
<pb id="ward348" n="348"/>
employed by them for twenty days; and I shall not
soon forget either their trueness and devotion to the
cause, or their kindness to myself personally. There
are a great many disagreeables connected with an
agency, especially a travelling agency; that was the
last I accepted, and I hope never to accept another:
but all the unpleasant things naturally and necessarily
appertaining to an agency are very greatly modified, if
not entirely overcome, by such kindness as that
shown me by this society and John Smith, Esq., its
respected Secretary.</p>
            <p>I think I can say of Scottish abolitionists generally,
that they are as laborious and self-sacrificing as any
band of anti-slavery people I ever saw. I have already
said that it partakes of their very intelligent religious
character. But this is not all. It is formed of the traits
which make up the whole of Scottish character: the
elements of the latter enter into and comprise the
former. It follows, that whatever of sterling integrity,
deep earnestness, unfaltering perseverance,
enlightened and large-hearted humanity, and 
high-toned religious sentiment, are peculiar to the Scot,
both by nature and by education, mark and distinguish
his abolitionism. Hence, the announcement of a
meeting or a contribution brings the true Scot to the
place of assemblage, and brings, with him, his
donation
<pb id="ward349" n="349"/>
and his prayer. It may rain, his funds may be low,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref39" n="39" rend="sc" target="note39">*</ref>
<note id="note39" n="39" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref39"><lg><l>* “A man may tak his neebur's part</l><l>Yet hae no cash to spare.”</l></lg></note>there may be other obstacles: but what of these? He is
a Scotchman. This is duty; its performance, with him,
is not to depend upon whether it be convenient or
not. Hence, also, when Scotchmen have gone to the
colonies, they have made those distant countries feel
the impress of their character in general matters,
producing the best fruits of energy and intelligence;
but when they have so drifted with the stream, in
slaveholding countries, as to become partakers of the
evil deeds of their neighbours, they have not been
restrained from the lowest depths of wickedness to
which many of other nations have sunk.</p>
            <p>Scotchmen, in the West Indies, became
slaveholders. They were severely exacting and
oppressive. It was just like them to demand, and, if
possible, to receive, the last <hi rend="italics">“baubee,”</hi> from the
unpaid toil of their slaves. They required the
exhibition of Scottish energy from their bondmen; if
they did not receive it, they were prepared to exhibit
Scotch energy in forcing it out of them. Instances of
this sort are to be remembered of many Scotch
slaveholders (and, alas! by many Negroes, who were
their slaves) to this day. The record of them, and the
names of their perpetrators,
<pb id="ward350" n="350"/>
would be the largest, blackest roll and record of
infamy that ever disgraced the Scottish name or
blighted Scottish character. It is therefore most fit that
there should be in their native country a fearless,
persevering band, who are redeeming the name and
character of the nation, disgraced by such recreants. It
is true, also, that among the thousand and one vices
into which no inconsiderable number of our fellow
subjects from the North fell, when slaveholders, was
that which violated the seventh commandment. Like
others, they treated their children of African blood as
half-castes, and denied them social equality with
whites—raising them <hi rend="italics">above</hi> the condition of their
mothers, depressing them <hi rend="italics">beneath</hi> that of their fathers—
them a silly, supercilious, unmanly, half-race, unfit for
any social position, alike uncomfortable among whites
or blacks. But while it is true that, in these matters,
Scotchmen showed themselves but human beings, it
is also true that, unlike Yankee slaveholders, they did
not, as a rule, <hi rend="italics">trade</hi> in the persons of their own
children! They would not disown them; they would
and did educate them, and settle property upon them.
This is, I believe, commonly true of Scotch slaveholders
in America—more commonly than of any others. A
Yankee will sell his own child quite as readily as one
of his black neighbour's; and with as little
<pb id="ward351" n="351"/>
remorse or concern. He can do that and belong to
Church, and remain “in good and regular standing.”
A Scotchman, as a rule, says practically,
“I canna do <hi rend="italics">that”!</hi></p>
            <p>I must do Scotchmen the justice to add, too, that in
America they do not forget, so soon as other men
from these islands, the fact that they were born in a
land of freedom and equality as to races and colours.
They do not so easily learn to trample upon a free
Negro, and to tread his rights in the dust. I do not
deny that there are most lamentable cases of this
description, but I do affirm that they are not nearly so
frequent and so numerous as is true of other British
nationalities. Perhaps I shall be excused for stating a
case of some prominence, which illustrates my idea.</p>
            <p>There is in America a total abstinence organization
called the “Sons of Temperance.” It is, in some
respects, a secret society. It has done a great deal to
promote the cause of total abstinence in that country,
where such labours are greatly needed; but, like other
benevolent societies in America, this order passes the
black man by, and accommodates the prejudices of its
members and the community by treating coloured
persons after the ordinary way of treating them—
refusing them membership upon equal terms with
others. This is done by the Churches to which these
gentlemen
<pb id="ward352" n="352"/>
belong: and why should not a Temperance Society
take the Church for its model? They also refuse to
grant black persons charters empowering them to form
Lodges of blacks. In a word, they seem to prefer the
gratification of their ill will to the Negro, to allowing
him to receive the benefits of their Order. I grieve to
say, that they have not changed in the least, in this
disposition. They still seem to say, “we prefer the
continued drunkenness of the Negro, with all its
attendant horrors, to admitting him to our fraternity. If
some one will save him, well; but as for <hi rend="italics">us</hi> 
and <hi rend="italics">our
Order,</hi> we prefer his going to perdition as he is, to the
relaxation of our rule.”</p>
            <p>In the early history of the Order there was no rule
on the subject. Accordingly, in some divisions (as the
Lodges are called) remote from New York, blacks were
admitted. Several were received in New England;
many are in Canada. I was admitted in Cortland; but
the dissatisfaction arising out of my case was so
great, that the New York Division sent a deputy
<ref targOrder="U" id="ref40" n="40" rend="sc" target="note40">*</ref><note id="note40" n="40" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref40"><p>* Captain Cady.</p></note> to
order my expulsion. In 1851, the National Division
passed a rule declaring it “illegal and inexpedient to
admit coloured persons;” they have since that time
confirmed this vote, by refusing to amend or alter it. In
my own case, we threw our charter into their teeth,
and
<pb id="ward353" n="353"/>
dissolved the Division. The presiding officer was a
member of my Church; the next in rank was the clerk of
the Church; another member was a deacon, whom I
had ordained; many more were attendants upon my
ministry. Could they submit to a demand to expel their
chosen pastor, on account of his colour? Could they
consent to belong to a fraternity demanding it? No;
they honoured themselves, their principles, and their
minister, by indignantly washing their hands of all
participation in such an organization. It follows, that
black persons are not legal members; of course, to
such, charters are not to be granted. Besides, if blacks
might form constituent Divisions, they would be
entitled to be represented in Grand Divisions: that
would never answer. It may be, that in another world,
whether of bliss or woe, blacks and whites are in
close association, or even in close contact; but on
earth—<hi rend="italics">i. e., American earth,</hi> and among <hi rend="italics">the Sons of
Temperance</hi>—such a thing is out of the question.</p>
            <p>But what has this to do with Scotchmen? I will
show. In the face of this general universal Negro-hate,
several Scottish temperance men in the city of New
York withdrew from the Order, formed the Caledonian
Division, admitted black members, and granted them
charters to form black Divisions on terms of the most
perfect equality with themselves. The same, I am sorry
to say,
<pb id="ward354" n="354"/>
is not true of any other British nationality; but
Englishmen, Irishmen, Welshmen, and Canadians,
belong to the Negro-hating Divisions, and help to
enforce and sustain the anti-Negro rule. I will take the
liberty of saying here, that were all Scotchmen and
other British people, upon going to America, to act as
did this Caledonian Division, the whole current of
pro-slavery opinion in America would be turned. So
numerous—and so powerful, after a very short
residence—are those who once were subjects of Britain,
in that country, that they could have long since
revolutionized public sentiment on this matter, had
they chosen to do so. Let me state a case. The Rev.
Mr. McClure says, that in one of the Methodist
Churches in a large town in New Jersey, there were
several English, and also several coloured,
communicants. The rule was (a rule almost invariable
among American Methodists and others), that the
black members should not commune until the whites
had been served. These Englishmen, in a body,
remained until the coloured people were called, and
then came and received the emblems with them—thus
identifying themselves, as Jesus did, with the poor.
The consequence was, that the rule was broken down;
and now, whites and blacks are treated alike, as they
should be. Mr. McClure observes, that were the same
thing, in like circumstances, done by Englishmen
<pb id="ward355" n="355"/>
generally, in America, they are numerous
enough to carry their point in almost every
community. I know that the same would be true of
Irishmen and Scotchmen, had they the manliness to
try it.</p>
            <p>Emigrants from England, therefore, when going to
America and becoming Americanized on this subject,
not only do great evil to the Negro, but fail, guiltily fail,
to do him the good which lies in their power. I could
not write so freely as I have concerning American
guilt, and be silent touching the like turpitude of former
British subjects. In contrast with what is too common
there, I take great pleasure in bearing testimony to the
noble stand of the Caledonian Division; and beg to
add, that one of the aims of the Scottish Anti-Slavery
Societies, and those in all other parts of the three
kingdoms, should be, in my humble judgment, the
maintenance of a high-toned Christian anti-slavery
sentiment in every part of Britain, for the purpose of
warning emigrants against the guilt and danger to
which they will be exposed in this matter, when settled
in the United States; and, in the event of their falling
into such practice, rebuking them for lapsing from
principles which it was their pride to avow when at
home. While in Scotland, I spoke freely upon this
point; and am proud to be able to say, that I did so
with the fullest concurrence of the ladies and
gentlemen of the Anti-Slavery Societies.</p>
            <pb id="ward356" n="356"/>
            <p>I never saw, before or elsewhere, such cultivation
of the soil, as in Scotland. I have travelled from Maine
to Wisconsin, and over the finest portions of New
York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Ohio; but never
saw farming so perfect as it is everywhere in the
Scotch lowlands. Ayrshire, the Lothians, the valleys
of the Clyde and the Tay, the land surrounding
Edinburgh, and the valley of the Tweed, exceed not
only in fertility, but in highly finished and scientific
culture, anything I ever saw. Give Canada such
farming, and she will stand among the first agricultural
countries of the north temperate zone—if not, indeed,
becoming <hi rend="italics">the</hi> first of them.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref41" n="41" rend="sc" target="note41">*</ref><note id="note41" n="41" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref41"><p>* Except Scotland, of course.</p></note> Had Australia such
farming, her inexhaustible gold mines would be but a
subordinate source of wealth. If poor Jamaica were but
advanced to an equal pitch of agricultural industry,
she would become a source of illimitable wealth, and
exceed in the future the palmiest days of her past
history.</p>
            <p>Perhaps I did not form so high an estimate of the
religious character of the Scottish people as some
travellers do; but what I saw of it was quite sufficient
to make me thankful that it is what it is, and that it is
doing so much to elevate the character of the
colonies, to which its possessors are swarming in
such vast numbers every year. My only criticism
<pb id="ward357" n="357"/>
upon it is, an expression of the fear that it may
possibly be more educational than spiritual, more
intelligent than feeling, more doctrinal than practical—
more refined, metaphysical, and casuistic, than
reformatory. I utter this apprehension with extreme
deference, hoping that the remark will be received as
coming from a grateful, loving heart, not censuring,
but simply criticizing, with the full recollection of my
extreme incompetency to judge in such matters.</p>
            <p>Nor do I agree with the great majority of travellers as
to the alleged intemperance of the Scotch: indeed, I
heard more about this from Scotchmen than from any
others. The Scotch clergy do more in the cause of
temperance than the clergy of any other country, save
America or Canada. There is more legislation on the
subject in Scotland than anywhere else in Europe. The
subject is therefore more frequently spoken of, more
thoroughly examined, and its statistics are more
prominently brought out, than in the South. It is true
that custom demands and sanctions, in good society,
drinking more whiskey than is used by the same
amount of population in England; but that
drunkenness is more common among the lower
classes, or that the use of whiskey in the North
furnishes occasion for saying anything more of the
middle classes there than the use of wine here
<pb id="ward358" n="358"/>
affords, is certainly neither according to my
observation, nor to any comparison of the two
countries on the subject which I was able to make,
either from sight or reading.</p>
            <p>That the temperance cause has yet very much to do
in both countries, is most lamentably evident; that
religious men are called upon to look this question
directly in the face, and grapple with it, is equally
evident: and it is most gratifying to say, that the good
already done and now doing by total abstinence men
is also as evident. Everybody is remarking upon the
diminution of wine-drinking, and the almost entire
absence of inebriation, in the middling and higher
classes. Had the lower orders learned and practised
like moderation for the past thirty years, how different
would have been their state! how changed their
present condition! What different prospects would
both English and Scotch working classes present, as
well to their temporal and present as their future and
eternal welfare!</p>
            <p>I spoke of “moderation,” and know how that term is
hated by some temperance men; but beg to say, that it
is neither an unscriptural nor an unphilosophical term.
However, in the case of a man to whom alcoholic
beverages present too strong a temptation to allow of
any use of such drinks without intoxication, his only
course is immediate,
<pb id="ward359" n="359"/>
lifelong, total abstinence.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref42" n="42" rend="sc" target="note42">*</ref><note id="note42" n="42" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref42"><p>* That some should abstain, for the sake of example to others, is most
praiseworthy self-denial: all I claim is, that so to do is not, as I once
believed, the demand of the Bible, in the case of all persons. I do not feel at
liberty to write as if I were a total abstainer, now that I am not; yet would
not on any account withhold my humble tribute of praise from those who
are, nor say a word to injure the temperance cause.</p></note> May the demon of
drunkenness soon be banished from this otherwise
happy island!</p>

            <head>IRELAND.</head>
            <p>I MUST beg the generous reader to indulge me in saying
but little concerning the Emerald Isle. It is a country so
full of interest, making such rapid strides of
improvement, capable of such vast development, so
rich in material and intellectual resources, so deficient
in moral and spiritual cultivation, that it would be most
unjustifiable presumption, in one who has spent but
twenty clays there, ten of which were at Killarney, to
attempt to speak of it intelligently. If God spare me, I
shall know more of that island at some future day;
<hi rend="italics">then</hi> it will be time enough to speak of it at length.</p>
            <p>I was in Ireland a few days in September 1854, and
in June 1855. The first time, I simply crossed from
Holyhead to Kingston, spent a day or two there and at
Dublin, and passed rapidly, by rail, from thence to
Cork, where I spent a night, and hastened the next
day, through Mallow, to Killarney. There, like others, I
did, as nearly as possible, nothing: in fact, went there
for that very purpose.
<pb id="ward361" n="361"/>
We rode, walked, sailed, eat, drank, and slept, daily,
with some degree of regularity and perseverance, each
accomplishing his task to his own satisfaction. The
rich romantic scenery, the beauty of the lakes, the fine
old ruins of Mucruss Abbey and Ross Castle, the
beautiful grounds of Mr. Herbert, the affability of the
company we met, all gave us a variety of most
pleasing sights and sounds; and, being favoured with
extraordinarily fine weather, we could but be gratified
with our short sojourn in that picturesque locality.</p>
            <p>I must not forget, that Mr. Schiell, the gentlemanly
master of the Killarney Junction Railway Hotel,
understood as well as any man in that business ever
did, the art and science of making his guests
comfortable. I went there to rest—another name for
being lazy. So did others. We accomplished what we
went for. Now, please excuse my giving descriptions
of what I saw, for I have no descriptive power or talent
whatever. I can only say, that after having lived 
four-and-thirty years in America, I was not so well prepared
to appreciate Irish lake or mountain scenery as those
visitors who had never been out of this kingdom. I
appreciated the falls on Mr. Herbert's place, on
account of his very great kindness in suffering visitors
to witness them; but to one who lives within three
hours' sail of Niagara Falls, they certainly
<pb id="ward362" n="362"/>
did not appear <hi rend="italics">very wonderful.</hi> As to lakes, I live
on Lake Ontario, and have frequently sailed upon Lake
Erie and Lake Michigan. When I tell the reader that
one of these is 160 and another 180 miles long, he will
not wonder that I was not beyond measure astonished
at Killarney lakes. Then, as to small and beautiful lakes,
I beg to say, with great deference, but most certainly
with truth, that Skaneateles Lake, Geneva Lake, Seneca
Lake, and Crooked Lake, in New York State, are neither
excelled nor equalled by anything it has been my good
fortune to see on this side of the Atlantic. Still I was
pleased, greatly pleased, with the scenery of Killarney;
and the above is introduced less by way of boasting,
than apology for not being more perfectly captivated,
charmed, delighted, overwhelmed, and “all that sort of
thing,” which some persons thought “as in duty
bound” I ought to have been.</p>
            <p>I met at Cork some friends and relations of my good
neighbour, P. P. Hayes, Esq., of Toronto. Not having
time to call upon Father Mathew, as I had promised, if I
ever visited Cork, and having learned that he was
about to proceed to Florence for his health, I had the
melancholy pleasure of sending him my card, and an
expression of best wishes for the speedy recovery of
his wonted strength. I had met the venerable
<pb id="ward363" n="363"/>
priest at Cleveland, Ohio, in 1851. He was in my native
country, pursuing a most laudable work. Differences in
religion were of no moment to me, as compared with
the great work of philanthropy. I was but too happy,
therefore, to receive the invitation of Father Mathew
to visit him; and, had circumstances favoured it,
should have been delighted to do so.</p>
            <p>I had not the good fortune to hear the Rev. Dr.
Urwick on the Sunday I was in Dublin; but, at
Kingston, had the great pleasure of hearing that
most indefatigable and most successful pastor, the
Rev. Joseph Denham Smith, whom I had before
met in England, and from whom I received the
kindest attention. Mr. Smith is one of the English
ministers who have gone to Ireland to do good,
and have become most enthusiastically fond of
Ireland and the Irish. I saw this in all whom it
was my pleasure to meet, during both visits to that
country. The singular devotion which the
Independent ministers show to the people among whom
they live, and their great admiration for the land of
their labours, tend in no small degree to the almost
incredible efficiency and success of their labours.
Disconnected from the State, receiving not one
penny of State pay, they make manifest to all
the disinterestedness of their work; and show
as well, that great good can be accomplished now,
<pb id="ward364" n="364"/>
as in the days of the apostles, by voluntary,
persevering, religious effort. In no country is this more
manifest than in Ireland, where the class of ministers to
which Mr. Smith and his co-labourers belong are
obliged to compete with State Churchism in so many
forms. This remark is not made offensively. I am giving
utterance to my own religious opinions, without
disguise; and repeat, that their correctness, in practical
working, never struck me so forcibly as during my last
visit to Ireland: nor can I bring myself to believe that
any honest, honourable Christian, of whatever
denomination, will find fault with my refusing so far to
play the neutral, as to write as if I had no opinions or
were too unmanly to express them.</p>
            <p>My second visit to Ireland was on a short
anti-slavery tour. Leaving Glasgow on June 1st, I took a
steamer at Greenock, at seven p.m., for Belfast. A most
pleasant trip down the Clyde, on a moonlight night,
and across the placid waters betwixt the Scotch and
the Irish coasts, brought us into Belfast at five the next
morning. Breakfasting at the Imperial Hotel, and taking
the first morning train, I started on my way, having to
be in Sligo the next day. I travelled by railway only to
Armagh; the remainder of the journey, seventy or
eighty miles—Irish miles, in that brief
<pb id="ward365" n="365"/>
period—had to be made in such conveyances as I could
find. At Armagh I found in the coach a most ladylike
fellow passenger, in the person of Mrs. Caldwell, of
Clogher. By this kind lady I was introduced to Mrs.
Maxwell,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref43" n="43" rend="sc" target="note43">*</ref><note id="note43" n="43" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref43"><p>* A relative of Lord Cavan, I believe.</p></note> the Secretary of Clogher Anti-Slavery
Society. I seemed to Mrs. M. no stranger, as she had
been corresponding with my good friend Mr.
Armistead, of Leeds, concerning me. Professor Allen
was to speak there the following Tuesday, and both
Mrs. Caldwell and Mrs. Maxwell kindly and politely
invited me to attend with him. It was with deep regret
that I found myself unable to do so.</p>
            <p>I went on to Enniskillen, arriving at about five p.m. I
there learned, to my dismay, that there was no public
conveyance thence to Sligo, until the next morning. I
had no other way than to post on twenty-one miles, to
Manor Hamilton, which I reached at eleven o'clock
that night. On Sunday morning I drove eleven miles
into Sligo, in time to preach for the Rev. Noble
Shepherd, as per appointment. The next day
(Monday, 4th) a very large meeting was convened in
Mr. Shepherd's beautiful church, to hear me speak on
slavery. The Right Honourable John Wynne, at Mr.
Shepherd's request, favoured the meeting and the
cause by taking the chair. He did so in a
<pb id="ward366" n="366"/>
manner that showed his interest in the anti-slavery
question to be of no recent origin. Mr. Wynne being
connected with the first families of the Irish
aristocracy, both by birth and by marriage, and having
been Secretary to Her Majesty's Representative in
Ireland, I may be justly proud of that gentleman's
services and favour on that occasion. In that meeting I
saw a feature of Irish <sic corr="Protestantism">Protestanism</sic> which one does not
see in England. The Rev. the Rector attended this
meeting, and took a lively interest in it. The place was
completely filled, in every part, with a generous
auditory, no small proportion of them being
Episcopalians. A rector would not have attended a
meeting in an Independent chapel in England; there it
would have been considered necessary to hold the
meeting on “neutral ground”—in a hall, or 
school-house, or some such place. Except in the case of the
Rev. J. McConnel Hussey, of Kennington, who took
the chair on the 17th of October, 1854, at a meeting
held to promote education in a Dissenting
community,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref44" n="44" rend="sc" target="note44">*</ref><note id="note44" n="44" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref44"><p>* Rev. William Leask's school.</p></note> I do not recollect ever to have seen an
Episcopal clergyman in England so favouring the
objects, and so countenancing the movements, and so
recognizing the brotherhood, of Independents. It is a
beautiful feature, I repeat, of Irish Protestantism—of
true catholicity.</p>
            <pb id="ward367" n="367"/>
            <p>On the 5th, I journeyed a long, long way, sixty-six
miles, from Sligo to Mullingar, in a coach. Coaches, in
these railway days, are “slow” enough. Sixty-six Irish
miles are equal to eighty-four English. Packed, four
of us, in a coach of no very ample dimensions, was, if
comfortable, what we were not quite aware of. At a
certain stage of our journey, I asked the guard (a most
perfect specimen of an Irishman, “a broth of a boy”)—
“How far is it to Mullingar, guard?”</p>
            <p>“Two-and-twinty miles, yer honor.”</p>
            <p>“Irish miles are longer than English miles, are they
not?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, yer honor, and <hi rend="italics">quite as wide.”</hi></p>
            <p>We travelled over <hi rend="italics">both dimensions</hi> till we reached
Mullingar, heartily tired of our day's jolting, and
heartily glad to be once more in sight of a railway; at
least, that was my feeling, and my fellow passengers
acted as if they felt so too. After a very pleasant
passage from Mullingar to Dublin, some forty miles, I
was glad to secure rest at the Hibernian Hotel, my
Dublin home.</p>
            <p>Early on the morning of the 6th I took the railway to
Limerick, being met there by Rev. Wm. Tarbotton, and
a gentleman whose “Irish jaunting car” and large Irish
heart were ready to welcome me. It's meself that's to
blame for niver remimbering the gintleman's name, at
all at all;
<pb id="ward368" n="368"/>
and what is worse, I cannot remember the name of his
<hi rend="italics">kind lady,</hi> nor the name of <hi rend="italics">his brother,</hi> nor his
<hi rend="italics">brother's lady.</hi> Being almost cured of my lameness, I
was able, in the excellent company of Mr. Tarbotton,
to walk over most of Limerick, which is a fine thrifty
town, one of which the people of that country may
well be proud. Some of its warehouses are the most
massive structures of the sort I ever saw. The
elements of wealth in the trade and resources of the
town, and the surrounding country, but more in the
enterprise of its inhabitants, ensure for Limerick not
only the continuance of its high place among the
commercial towns of Ireland, but mark out for it a most
brilliant future.</p>
            <p>A very full meeting did me the honour to listen to
me, in Mr. Tarbotton's church; William Cochrane, Esq.,
kindly taking the chair, in the absence of the
gentleman who had generously consented to do so,
but to whom an accident had occurred the day before,
rendering him unable. The account given of the
meeting, the speech and the speaker, and the interest
shown in the cause, by the Limerick newspaper, were
full and kind; and I was grateful to see in them tokens
of the most genuine anti-slavery feeling, set off with
real Irish warmth and cordiality.</p>
            <p>Reluctantly leaving my kind Limerick friends,
<pb id="ward369" n="369"/>
who seemed like old acquaintances, I took the railway
on the 7th to Cork, where a most crowded and
attentive meeting greeted me, presided over by the
Worshipful the Mayor, Sir John Gordon. The Rev. M.
A. Henderson had kindly arranged the meeting for me.
It was convened in his church, the same in which Rev.
John Burnet had preached when labouring in Cork. A
most devoted anti-slavery family invited a number of
the Professors of the College to meet me, and these learned
gentlemen kindly participated in the proceedings of the meeting,
which was the most enthusiastic one I ever held, even
in Ireland. Every one seemed as if he came to the
meeting on purpose to be pleased, and was pleased
accordingly. I am sure the feeling of the audience, on
their own part, had much more to do with that
enthusiasm than the speech; and if the speech were
worth anything, it caught much of its inspiration from
them. Perhaps the best way to state the matter is, that
we had a good meeting altogether. To the Mayor, to
Rev. Mr. Henderson, to the Professors of the
University, and to our excellent friends the
Jenningses, are especial thanks due, for the
arrangements and good influences with which the
meeting was appointed and hold. It was my last
meeting in Ireland.</p>
            <p>Wishing to visit my beloved friends Dr. Collis
Browne and his lady, at Queen's Town, and knowing
<pb id="ward370" n="370"/>
the necessity of being in Dublin on the evening of
the 8th, I rose early on the morning of that day, and
took what I think is the most delightful little trip
Ireland affords—from Cork down to the Cove of Cork, or
Queenstown Harbour as it is now called. Returning in
the afternoon, I bade the Doctor and Mrs. B. farewell,
taking the three p.m. train to Dublin, hoping to see
them again in a few days; but, alas! the time has not
yet come, and it may be that we shall meet no more on
earth. I reached Dublin at ten p.m., and on the morning
of the 9th set off for Wales and England. Being then
able to walk without crutches, I gave mine to two
servants at the Hibernian. May they never need them!
That day I breakfasted in Dublin, dined at Holyhead,
and supped in Preston. Thus far extends the account
of my two short tours in Ireland.</p>
            <p>I beg now to say a few words about what I saw
while rapidly passing through that most interesting
country.</p>
            <p>1. I have already spoken of Rev. Joseph Denham
Smith, of Kingstown, and his labours. I now add, that
the Rev. Wm. Tarbotton, Rev. Noble Shepherd, and
Rev. M. A. Henderson, occupy positions of like
difficulty, influence, responsibility, and usefulness.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref45" n="45" rend="sc" target="note45">*</ref>
<note id="note45" n="45" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref45"><p>* Doubtless the same is true of other ministers, but these are the only
men in such circumstances I had the pleasure of meeting.</p></note>
They are, in like manner, devoted
<pb id="ward371" n="371"/>
most earnestly to the land in which, and the people
among whom, their lot is cast. I saw the same in the
excellent Presbyterian minister at Queenstown; and
cannot help repeating my solemn conviction, that the
Independent ministers, so far as I was able to judge,
have specially the position which gives them, in spite
of all opposition, the greatest advantages of all others
in Ireland, in “contending for the faith once delivered
to the saints.” That position is one of real issue with
Papal Catholicism. Their Church government, their
independence of both the control and patronage of the
State, and the success of their labours, are all-potent
Protestant arguments in themselves. The standpoint
from which one party sees things, and the ground
occupied by another party, when exhibiting truth, are
manifestly matters of great importance. The Roman
Catholic population see Protestant truth from a
standpoint whence they view all apparently coercive
State machinery in religion, with the feeling of a
persecuted party. Hence, in my humble judgment, the
peculiarly happy adaptation of the Independent
branch of the Christian Church to Ireland; for what
denomination soever is there connected with the State,
less or more, has, in that respect, an unfortunate
standing-place for influence with our Roman Catholic
fellow subjects: and surely the same remark applies to
all other Papal countries.</p>
            <pb id="ward372" n="372"/>
            <p>That Ireland is hopeless, no one believes. The
truth that prevailed in this and other countries will
prevail there. Advancing light, increasing education,
material improvement, the very increase of wealth, will
aid partly in undermining and partly in openly
assaulting, but at all events, finally, in the utter
overthrow of the Papal power in Ireland, as
elsewhere. In no part of Europe, Protestant or Papal, is
that system, either temporally or spiritually, what it
was a hundred years ago. It can never regain its lost
prestige, but it must certainly lose its hold, upon the
minds of its own votaries. It has no elements
adaptable to the middle of the nineteenth century. Its
doom is sealed in Ireland, as elsewhere. It is menaced
by the emigration of Irishmen, by the spread of
education, by the elevation of tenants, by landlords,
by Agricultural Societies, and by the onward, rolling
tide of progress, which, having once set in upon
Ireland, will never ebb, but sweep before it all systems
and customs which accord not with itself. Yet it is
right and dutiful to do what has to be done in the very
best way: and one who loves Ireland as I do, cannot
but grieve that among Protestants things should exist
which weaken their power to do good; while one
rejoices to know that other and better ideas prevail to
some extent, and that, in spite of the defects hinted at,
good is being
<pb id="ward373" n="373"/>
done—the proclamation of the gospel is being
blessed, and its truths will finally become triumphant—
in that island gem.</p>
            <p>2. The resources of Ireland must be immense. The
mountains, from all appearance, are rich in coals and
slate. The rivers are large, and capable of an indefinite
increase of commercial advantage. Some of the
harbours are equal to any in the three kingdoms. The
situation of Ireland for commercial purposes is most
fortunate and convenient, being nearer than any other
part of Britain to America. Why Galway, for example,
should not be the point of <hi rend="italics">entrée,</hi> I cannot imagine. We
sail along the coast of Ireland four-and-twenty hours
before we reach Holyhead. Why should we not land
on that coast? we should greatly shorten the voyage
by so doing. But if it be objected, that another sea
must be crossed before reaching England, let it be
remembered, that those who wish to go to Ireland from
England must cross that same sea, and so must all the
goods for Ireland landed here; and, descendant of an
Irishman though I be, I will not admit that it is any
further from Ireland to England than it is from England
to Ireland! Besides, there is to be a very great increase
of agricultural produce and of manufactured
commodities, especially in the north of Ireland; and
there are now six millions of population, which
doubtless will be very greatly
<pb id="ward374" n="374"/>
increased, in numbers and in wealth. These will give
ample employment, at no very distant day, to a line of
steamers devoted to Ireland and America, with one
occasionally, or at regular periods, to the West Indies.
Hence, whatever may be said about Ireland's being
the point of arrival from and departure to America,
surely Ireland need not always be tributary to this
island in that respect, so far as her own commerce is
concerned.</p>
            <p>The soil of that island is most surprisingly rich. The
moisture of the atmosphere, and the mildness of the
climate, make it the most natural grazing soil in the
world. With anything bordering upon Scotch
cultivation, there could scarcely be any limits to the
agricultural wealth of this country. It was indeed sad
to leave Scotland one evening, and to arrive in Ireland
the next morning, and witness the great, too great,
contrast between the culture of the soil, in the two
countries. Ireland never looks worse than when
entered from Scotland. The neatly trimmed hedge, the
smoothly turned furrow, the air of industry and thrift,
with their abundant reward smiling on every hand,
were left behind, on the other side. The neglected
broken hedge, the slovenly-looking field, the air of
neglect, and their legitimate consequences, frowned
on every hand upon us and around us, with the rarest
exceptions, from Belfast to Sligo, from Sligo to Mullingar,
<pb id="ward375" n="375"/>
from Dublin to Cork.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref46" n="46" rend="sc" target="note46">*</ref><note id="note46" n="46" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref46"><p>* The most perfectly Irish thing I saw in my tour was a field whose fences
were completely destroyed; but it had <hi rend="italics">iron gates, every one of which was
locked.</hi></p></note> Like frowns upon the
face of beauty, these Irish farms gave abundant
evidence that they were capable of presenting a very
different aspect. They told us plainly enough, that
what had made sterile Scotland what it is, would have
done far more for Ireland. “The hand of the diligent
maketh rich,” indeed. One could not but be smitten
with the unwelcome thought, that the neglect of such
land, affording such opportunities for the most ample
supply of all needs, is a species of sinfulness upon
which our Heavenly Father looks with the deepest
disapprobation. It is the neglect, the misuse, of a very
valuable talent. It is most gratifying to know, however,
that very important improvements are being
introduced, and that a spirit of reform has entered the
bosoms of landlords and tenants, from which the best
consequences are to be expected. Having so practical
a man as Viceroy in the Earl of Carlisle, it is quite
certain that no suggestion will be withholden by his
Excellency, and no aid sought refused, by which the
improvement of Ireland, so greatly needed, and now
happily begun, may be promoted.</p>
            <p>In manufactories, Ireland must ere long be among
the first of nations. There is every natural
<pb id="ward376" n="376"/>
and artificial facility for manufacturing, in the north of
Ireland, that there is in the north of England. Ulster
might be another Yorkshire or Lancashire. Nor is this
confined to the North. When speaking of these
facilities, I was frequently told that want of capital is
an obstacle. But English capitalists wish to make good
investments, and would as readily invest in Ireland as
in England, if they could only be “secure,” if it would
“pay.” Belfast and its vicinity answer any query on
those points; so does Limerick. In these material
temporal matters, most brilliant is the future of Ireland.</p>
            <p>3. Would that I could speak as hopefully of the Irish
working classes as of the soil and resources of the
country. Happily, the two are so connected, that the
improvement of the one will <sic corr="develop">develope</sic> the other. In
America, where land is cheap, and in Canada, where
corrupting influences are less common than in the
United States, I have seen the material improvement of
the Irish pauper elevate him above the depressions of
mind and morals which were considered inseparable
from his lot in Ireland. Then, the next generation
almost seem to belong to another race—to have lost the
degradations, and to have cultivated the upward
tendencies, of the Celt, to a most commendable
degree. That, doubtless, is the reason why they rise
superior to the influence of their priests, in the
colonies
<pb id="ward377" n="377"/>
and in America. It is impossible to treat Patrick
Thaddeus Mulligan, Esq., <hi rend="italics">now,</hi> as you treated him,
when he was nobody but poor, ignorant, ragged,
barefoot, Pat Mulligan. What raises Pat to Mr.
Patrick, in America, will do it, in spite of any
naturally depressing system, in Ireland. I know
a man in the county of Kerry, who is a Freemason.
He has been to America, made a little fortune, and
returned, able to live upon his property, although
he gratifies his industrious inclination by actively
pursuing business. When a poor man, no one was
more subject to his priest than he; now, Dr. Cullen
the Primate, and all the priesthood together, are
unable to drive him out of Masonry, or to hinder
his forming a Lodge in the town of his residence.
He told me this with his own lips. Of course I
give here no expression of opinion as to Masonry;
but mention this instance to illustrate my idea,
that improvement in the temporal circumstances of
our Irish fellow subjects will elevate them mentally
and morally, and that in spite of any religious system.
The best thing which the Papal system can
do for itself is, to adapt itself, so far as it can, really
or seemingly, to this inevitable and approaching
state of things. If it does not this, it must submit,
in Ireland as on the Continent, to be shorn of its
power over that people whom it has so long enthralled;
and when it wanes visibly, palpably, in
<pb id="ward378" n="378"/>
Ireland, its power for evil in this world is gone for
ever. I verily believe Ireland to be its last stronghold,
the place where it is to receive its deathwound.</p>
            <p>I am aware that this full expression of my candid
and, it may be, mistaken opinion, will not be palatable
to some who may cast a glance over these humble
pages. I have, however, been so accustomed to <hi rend="italics">speak</hi>
plainly, that, to write at all, I must <hi rend="italics">write</hi> plainly. I am
aware of no reason for withholding my honest
sentiments, being myself alone responsible for them;
and if it is my duty to write, it is included in that duty
to do more than seek to offer amusement for the
passing hour, on so grave a subject. To offer a book
to the public, under any circumstances, seems, in me,
little less than presumption; but that I should impose
upon my fellow men a book both brainless and
heartless—shallow enough, at best, in thought, and
destitute of soul—is more than I can consent to attempt.
Roman Catholics freely express their opinions: why
should not one of the humblest of Protestants? I am
conscious of doing so kindly, and should be sorry to
speak otherwise. After all, I expect less fault-finding,
with what is said on this and a preceding page, from
Romanists, than from squeamish, timid Protestants. Be
that as it may, “I have believed, therefore have I
spoken.”</p>
            <pb id="ward379" n="379"/>
            <p>To return from this digression: I could but grieve,
joyous as is the prospect before the Irish peasant, that
his present condition is so degraded. I belong to a
degraded race. Of the one hundred and sixty-four
millions of my unfortunate race, one hundred and fifty
millions are heathens, eight millions are slaves! In
speaking, therefore, of the Celt's degradation, I do not
forget the Negro's, nor my own sad inheritance of and
share in it. How can I forget an ever-present fact? But I
must be permitted to say, as I said freely when in
America, that in no part of that country where Negroes
are nominally free, much less where they are really free
(and I doubt if the same remark will not, with some
exceptions, apply to the enslaved class), did I ever see
such degradation as abounds not only in the towns,
but in the rural districts, of Ireland. In other countries,
poverty is deepest in towns—it recedes as you reach
the farming districts; but in Ireland, the roadside cabin
and its inhabitants are as dirty, as unthrifty, as scantily
fed and clad, as those who swarm in the most densely
populated towns. I have seen Ann Street, the worst
haunt of the most debased coloured population of
Boston—the Five Points, the Aceldama of New York—the
Moyamensing District, the incomparable,
unfathomable slough of Philadelphia's indecency; but
never saw so large a proportion of
<pb id="ward380" n="380"/>
a population so utterly degraded, as that in the
neighbouring island.</p>
            <p>I may be told, on the one hand, of Saxon rule as the
prolific parent of this terrible state of things; on the
other hand, I am told of Papal religion as the
producing cause of it. I will not discuss either of these,
but admit the force of both. Who can deny the fact of
Saxon rule? Who can deny the fact of Papal religion?
Who denies that the Irish peasantry have for
generations been subject to both? Neither is perfect.
All that is true. I will not stop to compare dates as to
the priority of these; nor inquire what have been the
tendencies of either, or both, in other countries. It is
aside from my present purpose either to consult
history or to express my opinion upon these points;
for I maintain that degradation, idleness, filth, such as
abound in Irish dwellings—and beggary, the
abominable profession of a very great number of hale,
strong, Irish men, women, and children—are 
self-chosen, self-imposed. Neither Saxon rulers nor Papal
priests can hinder a peasant's cleanliness of person,
nor his wife's use of the broom and the brush. It is not
owing to the rule of the one or the religion of the other
that a peasant's cabin is, by the peasant's election, a
<sic corr="pigsty">pigstye</sic>. Begging, instead of working, is the choice of
the Irish beggar. A decent self-respect would make it
impossible;
<pb id="ward381" n="381"/>
but you cannot enter a town, nor stop at a country
tavern, nor walk the streets, nor stroll on a country
road, nor take your way to “the place of prayer and
praise,” but at every yard or two you are beset and
besieged with persons sound in health and strong of
limb, covered with rags and reeking with filth,
begging, and doing nothing else, that you can see,
for a living. Kingstown swarms with them; in Dublin
they dog your footsteps at every turn. The same is
true of them in Cork, in Sligo, everywhere. <hi rend="italics">That</hi> you
will not find among my unfortunate people, in any
part of America or elsewhere.</p>
            <p>“They are poor:” so are the Welsh. “They are
taxed to support a religion in which they do not
believe:” so are the Welsh. “Wages are low:” so they
are in Wales. “Their cabins are small, and rudely
constructed:” so are Welsh cabins. “The landlords
do not encourage them:” nor do Welsh landlords.
“They cannot purchase comforts:” but they purchase
whiskey. “They are under other than Irish rule:” what
were they before that? the Welsh are under other than
Welsh rule. Why I compare these two nations shall
appear in another chapter. I introduce it here for the
purpose of remarking once more, that, in spite of all
other causes, it must be admitted that the degradation
of our Irish fellow subjects is a matter
<pb id="ward382" n="382"/>
of their own choosing: so I say of the degradation of
the Negro, who in many points is very like the Celt.
After all that slavery, like original sin, has done to
give us wrong tendencies, it is our business, with
God's help, to bid defiance to those tendencies, by
cultivating self-respect—at least, by imitating the
good qualities of those around us. Can I say less of
the condition and duty of the Irishman? The latter is,
to rise above his present condition, and be a <hi rend="italics">man;</hi> the former is of his own election, and therefore his own
fault.</p>
            <p>4. I now come to the most unwelcome part of my
task. Ireland furnishes my native country with a larger
proportion of immigrants than any other country in
Europe—except, perhaps, Germany: I can only say
“perhaps,” not having statistics before me, and not
recollecting the figures accurately. Of all Europeans,
the Irish immigrant becomes, as a rule, the most ready
dupe of the pro-slavery men. His low, vulgar habits at
home—the general readiness of one low class of
population to prey upon another—the example of the
Americans, and the quickness of the immigrant to
learn evil habits—most fully account for it, I know; and
know as well, that human nature is such a poor,
cowardly, knavish thing, that it will readily join in
trampling into the dust him whom everybody treads
upon: and I see nothing in the <hi rend="italics">low Irish</hi>
<pb id="ward383" n="383"/>
department of human nature to make it differ from the
common type. It turns out, that the man who on his
native bog is unwashed and unshaved, a fellow
lodger with his pig in a cabin too filthy for most
people's stables or styes, is, when arriving in
America, the Negro's birthplace, the free country for
which the Negro fought and bled, one of the first to
ridicule and abuse the free Negro—the Negro, who has
yet to learn how to sink into such depths of
degradation as the Irishman has just escaped from!
The bitterest, most heartless, most malignant, enemy
of the Negro, is the Irish immigrant.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, were the Irishman true to the
sentiments I found prevalent in every part of his
native country on this subject, he would with but little
exertion turn the tide of persecution from the Negro,
and, proving himself his friend, receive his gratitude;
then the two would grow up as brethren. The wit,
warmth, and enthusiasm—the capacity to imitate, to
improve, and to endure—the cheerfulness, bravery,
and love of religion—said to be peculiar to the Celt, are
well-known natural characteristics of the Negro. They
are in these points, when degraded and ignorant or
when educated and refined, alike, in a most remarkable
degree. The Negro, perhaps, has most of natural
mildness of temper: indeed, if he had not, he would
<pb id="ward384" n="384"/>
be a terror to the Irishman, as the Irishman is to him.
How I wish that the immigrant from the Emerald Isle
understood the doctrine of the brotherhood of man,
and practised it towards his coloured fellow citizen! If
he did, one of the most serious obstacles to the cause
of the Negro would disappear, in America. I do hope
that Irish abolitionists will be true to emigrants,
exhorting them to save themselves from the
abominations of pro-slaveryism, and rebuking those
who ruthlessly trample upon the Negro—who found
friends in O'Connell and Madden, and who now, for
the best of reasons, blesses the names of Richard
Webb, Mr. Jennings, the Marquis of Sligo, and the
Right Honourable John Wynne.</p>
            <p>If, however, the present hostility of the Irish
towards the black continue, it may pass the bounds of
even a Negro's endurance, and provoke such a
reaction as all must regret. The increasing numbers,
growing intelligence, and advancing progress, of the
Negro in America, will one day make him no mean foe
for the Celt to contend against. Before such disaster
befall both races, and that a spirit of mutual good will

            <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
            <head>WALES.</head>
            <p>AT the invitation of Richard Griffiths, Esq., I
accompanied him into Wales in August, 1854. It was
my first visit to the Principality. I was peculiarly
fortunate in having as a fellow traveller a gentleman
who knew the country thoroughly, and who could,
when occasion required, speak for me the language,
and translate it to me. We visited Bangor, Holyhead,
Beaumaris, Caernarvon, Llanberris, Snowdon,
Aberystwyth, Welshpool, and so forth. My stay was
so short that I can say but little of Wales, but must
say that little with very great pleasure; for no
country, no people, ever pleased me so much—
excepting black people, of course.</p>
            <p>I spent a Sabbath at Bangor, preaching three times
to audiences of whom some could not understand
sufficient English to follow a discourse. They came,
however, because they wished to encourage the
cause I represented, and to show their interest in the
gospel, though preached in a language of which they
could understand but few words. In one
<pb id="ward386" n="386"/>
instance, however, there was a sermon in Welsh from
one of the native ministers. This gave those who
could not understand me an opportunity to receive
benefit in their own tongue.</p>
            <p>I had a very large anti-slavery meeting in Bangor,
and the kind feeling of the audience was peculiar to
that most benevolent people. Fortunately, all the
remarks made concerning the speech were in Welsh,
whereof I understood not one syllable, and therefore
remained in happy ignorance as to whether I was
praised or blamed, until they gave me kind, <hi rend="italics">tangible</hi>
tokens of their regard. <hi rend="italics">That</hi> I understood; that was not
Welsh, it was the language of the heart. I do not say
that Welsh is not: but only, that I understand the one,
and not the other. At Beaumaris I spoke on
temperance, part of the evening, and the other part, on
anti-slavery; the same at Holyhead and Caernarvon.
On one of the days of our sojourn at Bangor we
visited the Penryn slate quarries, belonging to the
Honourable Colonel Tennant. It is a most gigantic
work: the number of men employed would make quite
a town, in Canada. The good order, steady industry,
and regular habits, of the workmen, were quite
evident. The village near the castle, composed of the
labourers' cottages, and the schoolhouse and
gardens, are the most beautiful and the most
comfortable cottages in North Wales:
<pb id="ward387" n="387"/>
indeed, I know of none equal to them anywhere. Lady
Louisa, Colonel Tennant's wife, had them erected
according to models of her own drawing. The school, I
believe, is at her expense. Neglected as the labourers
of Wales generally are, it was most gratifying to see
this specimen of kind carefulness.</p>
            <p>Beaumaris is quite a fashionable watering-place, and
it is a very quiet, neat little town. It has a most capital
hotel, quite equal to the great majority of English ones.
The same may be true of Bangor; but the kindness of
Mr. Edwards, our host, would not allow us to know.
Caernarvon is, of course, rich in historic interest: its
castle is a fine ruin. I spent some two or three days
there very agreeably, being the guest of Mr. Hughes, a
most kind and hospitable gentleman. From his house
we made up a party to visit Snowdon—ascending it on
foot, and returning in the same way. A more fatiguing
journey of five miles it was never my fortune, good or
ill, to make. What added to the discomfort of it was,
that on reaching the top, we saw nothing but a thick
Welsh mountain fog! but we had a most delightful
view of the neighbouring hills and dales, from a point
about half way to the summit. Being obliged to drive
eight miles and speak that night at Caernarvon—to
travel ninety-seven miles the next day, in a
<pb id="ward388" n="388"/>
stage coach—and to preach three times the third day—
made no small affair of the exercise.</p>
            <p>Reaching Aberystwyth late on Saturday night, I was
glad to take the comfortable quarters offered to the
weary in the Royal Hotel. It had rained all day; but, in
spite of rain, it was most delightful to travel amid the
beautifully diversified scenery betwixt Caernarvon and
Aberystwyth. It is bolder than Irish scenery, and the
cultivation is far better—though not so good, I thought,
as the Scotch; but the farming of Wales is far from
being indifferent. I spent some four or five days in
Aberystwyth, making some acquaintances I shall ever
remember: among them are the excellent pastors of the
Churches, and the Rev. Mr. Davies and his excellent
mother. I had the honour, too, of making the
acquaintance of Mr. Lloyd, one of the leading gentry
of the country, now Lord Lieutenant of Cardiganshire.
Mr. L. took the chair at a meeting which I addressed;
and was kind enough to say, one of his inducements
to attend was, that the meeting was to be addressed
by a gentleman from Canada. Having been in early life
stationed there with his regiment, the gallant
gentleman had acquired an interest in my adopted
country which did not leave him upon his return to
Wales.</p>
            <p>From Aberystwyth I returned to England by
<pb id="ward389" n="389"/>
Welshpool, where I spent an evening, and attended a
temperance meeting. The drive through that part of
Wales is one of the most beautiful in this island of
beautiful scenery. It reminds one of the valleys of the
Genessee, the Susquehannah, and some portions of
the St. Lawrence Valley. I know not when or where I
have enjoyed a drive more than those through North
and South Wales. Anybody else would be able to
describe the scenery: all I can say is, it was most
beautiful. What with the waving, ripened corn, the
youthful-looking greenness of the recently mown
meadows, the sparkling streamlets, the clear sky, and
the gorgeously brilliant August sunlight, I was
charmed beyond expression. I am sorry I cannot tell it
better: please kind reader, accept the best I can
perform. Since then, I have passed through portions of
Wales in very rapid flying tours, as when returning
from Ireland, last autumn and last spring; but have not
had the pleasure of making any stay there. I think,
however, that I have seen enough of Wales and the
Welsh to have formed some tolerably correct views of
their character.</p>
            <p>First, however, to record an incident of no small
interest to me, which occurred during my sojourn at
Aberystwyth. A gentleman named Williams, an agent
for one of the wealthiest landlords in Wales, lives
about a mile from Aberystwyth.
<pb id="ward390" n="390"/>
I learned that a little boy, a son of Mr. Williams,
who was ill, was anxious to see me, and that his
parents wished me to call. The Rev. Mr. Davies kindly
consented to accompany me, and we drove there. We
found Mr. and Mrs. Williams most kind and affable
persons; and upon being introduced to the chamber
where their son lay, we were struck with his emaciated
appearance; but in spite of this, his eyes beamed with
intelligence, and about his lips a most cheerful smile
played constantly. His mother told us he had been a
great sufferer. His bones were but slightly covered
with a wasted colourless skin. He could not stand or
walk, from lameness; and I believe there was but one
position in which he could lie. When we saw the
helplessness of the child, we were glad that we had
visited him. He had read “Uncle Tom's Cabin”; he felt
interested in the slaves, and daily prayed for them; he
had carefully laid by the little presents of money which
had been given him, and had a donation to give me,
for the cause of the slave. But what made the deepest
impression upon us was, his mother's telling us that, in
the midst of the very severe pains which tortured the
little sufferer, he would cry out, but immediately check
himself, saying “Mamma, I ought not to complain so.
How much more did Jesus suffer, for me!”</p>
            <pb id="ward391" n="391"/>
            <p>We left that house feeling that we had been highly
privileged. We had learned the lesson of patient
suffering at the bedside of that dear child—had seen a
babe, as it were, praising God. That the child could
long live, seemed out of the question; but the wheat of
the surrounding fields was no more ripe for the sickle,
than was that child to be gathered unto God. Since
that day, I never suffer pain, complainingly, without
fancying I see the bright, beaming eye of little Williams
rebuking me, as he hushes his own cries, in the midst
of anguish, by the recollection of “how much more
Jesus suffered for him.” That child may, ere this, have
been called to his rest; he may be with Him whose
sufferings he learned so early to contemplate: but until
I meet him in another world, I shall ever remember the
lesson learned at his bedside. Since that time, some of
the severest pangs I ever felt have been mine, both in
body and mind; but their coming is accompanied by
the remembrance of what that beloved child learned, in
agony. And, blessed be God! the divine consolations
which lulled his pains are abundant, infinite in
efficacy!</p>
            <p>Wales is the most moral and most religious country,
and her peasantry the best peasantry, that I know.
Doubtless, many will differ from me; but such is my
very decided opinion, based on the following reasons:—</p>
            <pb id="ward392" n="392"/>
            <p>1. The courts in Wales have fewer cases of
scandalous crimes and misdemeanors to deal with
than the courts of any other part of the kingdom, of
the same population. The difference betwixt Wales
and Ireland, in this respect, is immense.</p>
            <p>2. But go to a Welsh town (such as Bangor), and
how quiet and moral is it, compared with any town of
the like population you can name in England, Ireland,
or Scotland! Not a woman walking the streets for lewd
purposes, not a drunkard brawling in the highways, no
rows or fights; quietness and order reign everywhere.
Holyhead is a seaport; it is the same there, and so in
every town I visited.</p>
            <p>3. The temperance cause has done more for Wales
than for any other part of the kingdom. A drunken
peasant is, indeed, a rare sight in Wales. The miners,
the farm servants, and the ordinary labourers, all agree,
somehow or other, to be temperate. Not that all are
abstainers; but a more temperate peasantry, I am free
to confess, there is not, even in Maine!</p>
            <p>4. There is no begging in Wales. There are children
who run after the carriages of tourists and cry,
“ha'penny!” about the only English word they know;
and this more for sport than halfpence. But there is
little or no encouragement given to it by the
inhabitants; and there is no
<pb id="ward393" n="393"/>
such thing as a swarm of beggars at every corner,
door, hotel, church-gate, and everywhere else, as in
every part of Ireland.</p>
            <p>5. The Welsh are poor as well as the Irish; and their
landlords sufficiently neglect them, as to their
dwellings: but the cleanliness of the peasantry is most
striking. The contrast betwixt Holyhead and
Kingstown, within four hours' sail of each other, is
most remarkable. One can scarcely believe that he has
not been to two opposite sides of the globe, instead of
across a narrow channel. The reader will now see why
I blame the Irish for their defects, in contrast with the
Welsh.</p>
            <p>6. The industry of the poorer classes in the
Principality is most commendable. I know this has
much to do with any people's moral and religious
character. No one believes, as no one ought, in a very
high-toned and exemplary morality, or a very devoted
religion, conjoined with idleness. I do believe that the
Welsh labouring classes are more correct in this than
even the Highlanders in Scotland. Patient though not
overpaid toil, mitigated by few comforts, is not only
the lot, but to all appearance the choice, of the Welsh
peasant. I have seen more idlers in one street, in
Kingstown—in a circumference of 300 yards, in
Glasgow—or in a small village, in Essex or Norfolk—than
one can see in the whole of Wales.</p>
            <pb id="ward394" n="394"/>
            <p>7. The Welsh population not only attend divine
service, but are religious: I say “the population,”
because it is not true, as in England, of a few persons
only out of the many, but, like the Scotch, of the
people generally. There are some curious and
interesting facts in connection with this. In the first
place, the Welsh are not Episcopalians: nine tenths of
them dissent from the Establishment. It is most
ridiculous to tax them for its support, for they do not
go near it. Still, they quietly go to their chapels, and as
quietly pay for their support. In the next place, they
are not mere nominal members of Churches. The
majority belong to the Calvinistic Methodist
denomination, whose rules are highly and properly
rigid. No laxity in morals is allowed to pass unrebuked.
Besides, in travelling through Wales, it is seen that
almost wherever there are a dozen houses, one of them
is a chapel. The people feel their religious wants, and
supply them. Moreover, the ministers of the
denomination alluded to, and all others, take especial
care and pains in looking after their flocks. Their
preaching is deeply earnest, practical, scriptural, plain,
and personal; also, most pathetic and affectionate.
These combined influences are in constant operation,
and are producing the very best effects upon a
remarkably straightforward, simpleminded people.</p>
            <pb id="ward395" n="395"/>
            <p>Compare these sturdy, honest preachers, with the
priests of Romanism! Compare their flocks with the
Papal populations of, I care not what country! I
cannot consent to argue the case: in the living history
of present fact it stands out in bold relief. It speaks for
itself, in language clear and intelligible; its truths are
undeniable, unquestionable: and though our fellow
subjects of the Principality are less wealthy and less
learned than some more flattered inhabitants of other
portions of these islands, they excel us all in some of
the best, noblest, traits that ever adorned human
character. Should they diffuse education more
thoroughly, cling with less tenacity to their mother
tongue, draw more largely from the “well of English
undefiled,” and mingle more with the other elements of
British population, then that brave little Principality
will one day be more often visited and considered: it
will take rank as high in other matters, as in morals;
and, in peculiar distinctive character, appear, to its
present despisers, beautiful as its own valley scenery,
elevated as Snowdon's loftiest summit!</p>
            <p>I have spoken mostly of the labouring classes in
Wales; and have only to add, that the better and
higher classes are essentially Englishmen—with the
exception, I must once more remark, of being very far
behind Englishmen and Scotchmen (and,
<pb id="ward396" n="396"/>
according to the papers of the day, behind Irishmen as
well!) as landlords. They need to follow more closely
the example set by the Honourable Colonel Tennant
and the Lady Louisa, in caring for those who minister
to their comforts and convenience. I am sure an one
who visits the village referred to will join me in this remark.</p>
            <p>I know what will be said, in other countries than
Wales, in reply to what I say of the chastity of the
Welsh female peasantry. Reference will be made to the
stupid system of courtship called “bundling”—a
practice for which there is no defence: most certainly, I
have no word to utter in its behalf. That it has not been
attended with far worse consequences, is to me a
marvel. But I have the great happiness to know, that
the pulpit, which is more powerful in Wales than in any
Protestant country elsewhere, has turned its whole
power and influence against this barbarous practice,
so that not even it, to any extent, forms a drawback to
the remarks I have made upon the morality of the
Welsh peasantry. It is to be hoped that a custom
which has nothing better than its antiquity for its
apology, but is liable to the very gravest objections on
the score of morality and decency, will soon be known
merely as a matter of history. Surely, when a custom so
pernicious shall once be put away, all will rejoice, and
all will wonder that a people of
<pb id="ward397" n="397"/>
such sterling sense should have suffered it to
continue so long. It certainly has outlived the former
bad taste of the people; and therefore, if for no higher
reason, it ought to live no longer. Most earnestly is it
to be hoped that this abominable relic of ancient
British barbarism will soon be so completely
banished, as no longer to mar the otherwise good and
exemplary character of the honest youths and
maidens of that delightful Principality.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
            <head>GRATEFUL REMINSICENCES—CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>ALTHOUGH I fear having written too much already,
without contributing to the amusement or profit of the
reader, I cannot conclude without speaking somewhat
definitely of some things which are, to me, of more
than ordinary interest.</p>
            <p>It is true that I cannot feel an Englishman's interest
in relics of antiquity. My life has been spent in a new
country, and I cannot bring myself to admire old
buildings and ruins. Rhyl is preferred, by me, before
any other town in Wales, because of its new and fresh
appearance; for the same reason, Cheltenham and
Southampton suit me better than any other towns in
England. However, I visited Westminster Abbey,
heard the janitor's tale of who lies here and who lies
there, and felt that my knowledge of English history,
with its dates and figures, was refreshed and
increased. But the statues of Pitt, Wilberforce, Buxton,
and Clarkson, interested me more than all the ancient
things put together: in them
<pb id="ward399" n="399"/>
I saw, not simply the features of men eminent in days
recently gone by, but of those who were dear to me
and my people, on account of their devotion to the
cause of freedom. I visited the place where their
monuments are, as one would visit the tomb of his
benefactors: they were my benefactors. I wished to
convey back to my people the impressions I felt upon
looking at the marble which represented, as well as it
could, faces and forms once glowing with life and
teeming with energy; both devoted to the cause of
the Negro.</p>
            <p>I went to see the Cathedral at Canterbury, and
attended a service in the chapel; also visited, in
company with the Rev. J. A. Miller, St. George's
Cathedral at Windsor, and attended service in the
Knights' Chapel. By invitation of the Earl of
Shaftesbury, I attended a service for the charity
children, in St. Paul's. The vastness of this great
cathedral, the immense number of neatly dressed
children, the beauty of the service, and the rich
spiritual sermon of the Bishop of Chester,
overwhelmed me with feelings and impressions I
cannot describe.</p>
            <p>The Rev. James Parsons, of York, with his usual
kindness, requested Miss Parsons to accompany me
to York Minster. We attended service, and heard the
beautiful intonations in which cathedral services are
usually performed. The beauty
<pb id="ward400" n="400"/>
of that great Gothic pile impressed me most
profoundly. I could but exclaim, “If this be Gothic, a
great many buildings, <hi rend="italics">called ‘Gothic,’</hi> are simply
<hi rend="italics">Vandal!”</hi></p>
            <p>Mrs. Finley, the niece of Captain Hamilton, kindly
accompanied me to see the Cathedral of Glasgow. It is
a fine old structure, full of historic interest, and must
be a most charming sight for any one fond of old
things; but I, poor backwoodsman! take far more
delight in seeing a newly built, freshly painted
building!</p>
            <p>I confess, however, that there were two old
buildings, near to Ulverstone, in Lancashire, which I
visited with very peculiar interest, in company with
the Rev. James Browne. They are historical buildings,
and, to me, of great importance, because of their
relation to an honoured branch of the Christian
Church to which my people are very much indebted;
those buildings are, the former residence and the
chapel of George Fox.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref47" n="47" rend="sc" target="note47">*</ref><note id="note47" n="47" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref47"><p>* Bunyan's Chapel, at Bedford—Baxter's, Oxendon Street, London—
Doddridge's, Northampton—in each of which I have preached, were to me
most interesting.</p></note> I saw the house which he
frequently visited when a bachelor, and in which he
lived after his marriage: also, the window from which
he first preached his principles to the people of the
neighbourhood. The chapel is a low place, of small
size, but neat and
<pb id="ward401" n="401"/>
substantial; it stands in a pretty, well kept enclosure,
still used as a burying-place. The meetings of the
Friends, in that locality, are holden in that venerable
chapel. Here arose the “Society called Friends, or
Quakers.” From this humble meeting-house began
that sect whose members are in all parts of England,
some of them among the most wealthy of living men.
In America, how many of their meeting-houses are
very much larger than this, the birthplace of
Quakerism! indeed, I know of none there so small as
this. Here arose a sect despised, ridiculed, persecuted.
They spread, however, all over Christendom; they
preached the gospel of peace to almost all the families
and tribes of living man; they purged their own sect of
slaveholding; they have impressed their principles
upon the generations among whom they have lived;
they have been, in all times, the friends and helpers of
the poor and the needy. No sect better than they
deserves the distinct appellation of <hi rend="italics">Friends.</hi></p>
            <p>They may not now be increasing in numbers; the
very reverse of this is true, in some, many, places. In
America there have been some sad divisions, and
more lamentable heresies, among them; some, indeed,
have quite forsaken and forsworn the anti-slavery
principles of the sect. But the Society of Friends has
accomplished a very important mission; and it may be
that, since their
<pb id="ward402" n="402"/>
principles and distinctive ideas are so well understood,
and so many of the most useful and most
catholic of these principles are impressed upon and
promulgated by other sects, this pure and honoured
denomination can afford the diminution of its
members. The defections and heresies of which I have
spoken seemed, to me, to be gently rebuked by the old
Bible of George Fox, which was chained to a desk in
the old meeting-house. It is a quaint old volume, of
the date of 1541, and reads after the style of that day.
It was the corner-stone of George Fox's faith, the
armoury whence he drew his weapons, the directory
of his spotless life. Nothing of the antique, nothing of
a past age, gave me deeper interest, than the
residence, the chapel, and the Bible, of George Fox. If
not so antique as other places and things, it was the
most ancient of Quaker things, the earliest of the
interesting relics of that sect, which has done more for
mankind than, perhaps, any other of like numbers,
since the days of the apostles and the martyrs.</p>
            <p>In connection with this part of the present chapter I
beg to observe, that in the winter of 1853-54 I had the
pleasure of holding a meeting in the Friends'
 meeting-house in Kendall. The chairman was the venerable Mr.
Braithwaite. He had kindly invited several of the most
distinguished personages, including his Worship the
Mayor, to
<pb id="ward403" n="403"/>
meet me. The next morning I met several members of
the Braithwaite family, many of whom are married, at
the old family mansion, at breakfast. Among the
guests was a daughter of the Missionary Moffatt,
from Africa. The Scriptures were read, according to the
good old custom of the Friends; and then Mrs.
Braithwaite, who has been a minister for many years,
preached a short sermon. I never heard any discourse
more pointed, more benevolent, more touching. She
began upon the fact that there were in the room
persons from different and distant countries,
representatives of different races and climes,
professing love towards and faith in a common
Saviour, and worshipping the same Heavenly Father.
She dwelt with delight upon that scene, as one
somewhat similar to the gathering of the redeemed
around a common board in heaven, at a future day. I
do not pretend to give her words, but shall never
forget the Christian kindness which was breathed in
every one of them. Upon leaving, Mrs. Braithwaite
warmly shook my hand, and bade me “farewell,”
giving me advice as to my health, and commending me
to the gracious protection of God. We never shall meet
again on earth; but to have met such a disciple of
Jesus once, was a privilege worthy of more than
ordinary appreciation.</p>
            <p>John Morland, Esq., a member of the Society of
<pb id="ward404" n="404"/>
Friends, did me the honour, upon hearing me at
Croydon, in February last, of coming to me after the
meeting, to make arrangements for a lecture in the
Friends' School, in Croydon, that the pupils might
have an opportunity of hearing me plead in the slave's
behalf. The meeting was arranged and held. Mr.
Morland kindly made me his guest, and took me in his
carriage to introduce me to the venerable Peter
Bedford, Esq., the coadjutor of Clarkson. After the
meeting, the boys of the school presented me with a
generous donation, and a most kind and affectionate
written address, which I shall preserve as a memento
of those most interesting young gentlemen. “May the
angel who redeemed Jacob from all evil, bless the
lads!”</p>
            <p>To another member of the Society of Friends—John
Candler, Esq., of Chelmsford—I am under peculiar
obligations, and must state them, though without his
permission. I had read of that benevolent gentleman,
before coming to Europe—had known of his travels in
Brazil, the West Indies, and America, in prosecution of
his zealous anti-slavery labours. I knew that, like
Forster—the venerable and self-sacrificing Forster—he
was ready, if God pleased, to lay down his life in a
foreign country, rather than be disobedient to the
dictates of duty, as impressed upon him by the Spirit
of God. But it was not my pleasure and
<pb id="ward405" n="405"/>
privilege to meet Mr. Candler until last November:
indeed, when I was first at Chelmsford, Mrs. Candler,
whom I had the pleasure of meeting, informed me that
he had not returned from America, whither, at an
advanced age, he had accompanied Mr. Forster on his
last errand of mercy to the slave.</p>
            <p>In December last, by an arrangement which Messrs.
Wells and Perry had kindly made for me, I spoke in
Chelmsford. The Rev. Mr. Wilkinson kindly occupied
the chair. A vote of thanks was to be proposed,
according to arrangement, and Mr. Candler generously
consented to perform this part. In speaking, as his
abundant experience and extensive travels fully
qualified him to do, he entirely confirmed my
statements; and publicly said that, if in going to
Jamaica I should visit the parish of St. George, where
he owned a parcel of land, I should be most welcome
to fifty acres of it. Since that time Mr. Candler has
confirmed his gift, and given instructions accordingly
to his solicitor, W. W. Anderson, Esq., of Jamaica.
And, that I may do full justice to my benefactor, whose
munificence commenced with me in a public meeting,
on public grounds and for public purposes, I may
venture to add, that Mr. Candler has sold me his entire
interest in the tract referred to, at a price so nominal as
to make it equivalent to a gift. He
<pb id="ward406" n="406"/>
has also advised Mr. Anderson, who owns the
remaining moiety, to treat me with like kindness. I have
already arranged with Mr. Anderson for that moiety.
Thus, if my family shall be relieved from a position of
dependence, after my death—it will, under God, be
owing more to Mr. John Candler, of Chelmsford, than
to any other man. That I propose changing the name
of the estate from Albany to Candler Park,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref48" n="48" rend="sc" target="note48">*</ref><note id="note48" n="48" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref48"><p>* There is another estate called Albany, in the county of Cornwall. This is
in the county of Surrey, on the Great Spanish River.</p></note> will not
appear strange.</p>
            <p>The duty of spending a portion of every year in
Jamaica, until my son shall be old enough to attend to
that property, is thus made clear to me. It may be, that
our Heavenly Father will permit me to be of some
service to my people in that island.</p>
            <p>I now wish to say, more distinctly than heretofore,
that I feel under peculiar obligations to the Rev. Dr.
Raffles, for the very great kindness and sympathy he
showed me, at the time I received the sad intelligence
of my mother's demise. Handing Mr. Bolton's letter,
containing the intelligence, to the Doctor, as I sat in his
breakfast room, he most readily and most warmly
entered into my feelings, and treated me with such
kindness and consideration as I shall ever feel grateful
for. I beg to add, that generous-hearted gentleman has,
on all
<pb id="ward407" n="407"/>
occasions upon which I have had the pleasure of
being in his society, taught me by his amiable
demeanour to look upon him as a friend, and, if I might
say so much, a father.</p>
            <p>Upon several occasions, magistrates of towns have
honoured the cause which I came here to plead, by
presiding at my meetings. I tender my hearty thanks to
John Hope Shaw, Esq., and Mr. Wilson—each of
whom, when Mayor of Leeds, conferred upon me that
favour. I am under like obligations to the late Mayor of
Bury St. Edmunds, the late Mayor of Bedford, the
present Mayor of Southampton (Samson Payne, Esq.),
the Provost of Dunfermline, the Provost of Dundee, the
Provost of Montrose, the Mayor of Cork (Sir John
Gordon), and George Leeman, Esq. (who, when Lord
Mayor of York, not only presided, but gave me <hi rend="italics">other</hi>
most ample tokens of kind regard). Other exalted
personages, not magistrates, but of great influence and
status, have shown me like kindness. To the Right
Honourable John Wynne, Samuel Gurney, Esq., the
Right Honourable the Earl of Shaftesbury, and the
Right Honourable Lord Calthorpe, I beg hereby to
express thanks, both for myself, and those whose
cause I humbly plead, and whom I feebly represent.</p>
            <p>I owe thanks to James Spicer, Esq., for many acts of
very great personal kindness, at times and
<pb id="ward408" n="408"/>
under circumstances of peculiar trial. It is most
gratifying to acknowledge the obligation in this way,
and through this medium. To the many kind friends
(among whom is Isaac Beeman, Esq.) who most
generously contributed to aid me in my own personal
mission, I beg to say, the accounts of those
contributions are with Mr. Spicer; and that, while
living, I shall never cease to be grateful to him and to
them, for their repeated and, I may say, multiplied acts
of generous regard.</p>
            <p>I have reserved for myself until now, the pleasure of
placing on record the fact which has given me most
pleasure of all others, during my sojourn in the British
isles. It is, the growing, abounding love of the simple
gospel, among religious classes of all denominations.
The great wealth, high rank, vast learning, and
unrivalled inexhaustible resources, of the British
people, would, one might naturally suppose, tempt
them to a proud forgetfulness of the great matters of
the soul. As a stranger, I came here expecting to find
among Dissenters an earnestness and a spirituality
such as I had always been taught to believe they
possess. I imagined, however, that the prestige of the
great names of their fathers, and the worldwide fame of
many of their living divines, would naturally have led
them away from simplicity. In the Church of England, I
took it for granted,
<pb id="ward409" n="409"/>
State power, social status, and courtly fashion, had
eaten up whatever of vitality had remained before
Tractarianism arose; and that, since its rise and in its
progress, the religion of that denomination had been
swept away, or had degenerated into the merest
formalism. The first sermon I heard, however, in
London, was preached by the Archbishop of
Canterbury. Hearing that sermon not only gave me the
most exalted opinion of the venerable Primate, but it
led me to conclude that, if the clergy or any
considerable portion of them were preachers of that
stamp, I had been most mistaken in my views
concerning the religious state of the Established
Church. When, afterwards, I had the pleasure of
hearing the Bishop of Chester, the Rev. E. Hoare, the
Rev. Mr. Marshall, the Rev. Mr. Goodheart, and a few
others (Englishmen, Irishmen, Scotchmen, and
Welshmen, gave me opportunities to hear <hi rend="italics">but few</hi>),
and when I had the pleasure of conversing upon
religious subjects with some of the most pious laymen
of that denomination, I felt most thankful to be
disabused, and correctly informed, on this most
important subject. Two facts always exhibited
themselves in connection with this: one was, the deep,
earnest, biblical piety, conjoined with most active
benevolence, a readiness to every good word and
work, and accompanied by the sweetest simplicity,
<pb id="ward410" n="410"/>
which the pious class of Episcopalians exhibit;
the other was, their entire catholicity of spirit. In every
part of England, and among persons of all ranks, I had
the unspeakable happiness to find this. Nor was it
shown by studiously avoiding such points of
difference as lie between themselves and other
denominations; for in the frank, though kind,
expression of them, they showed how capable they
were of <hi rend="italics">differing</hi> with brethren, and <hi rend="italics">loving</hi> them <hi rend="italics">as</hi>
brethren, at the same time. I hardly need say, that
towards myself, personally, this feeling was invariably
exhibited.</p>
            <p>I was most gratified to find that, among Dissenters
as in the Establishment, simple faith in Christ's
salvation is the great theme of the pulpit. Rev. J.
Sherman I heard first; afterward, Rev. John Angell
James, Rev. H. J. Bevis, Rev. Dr. Halley, Rev. Dr.
Raffles, Rev. J. Baldwin Brown, Rev. Dr. Alexander,
Rev. S. Bergne, the Hon. and Rev. Baptist Wriothesley
Noel, Rev. Henry Allon, Rev. Samuel Martin, and Rev.
C. H. Spurgeon. Varied in style, talent, learning, and
other peculiarities, as are these gentlemen, and
different as are the classes of their hearers, they all
agree in preaching Jesus and his cross, for the
redemption of a sinful world. Thus the Christian
Churches in Great Britain are <hi rend="italics">one</hi> in the maintenance
and promulgation of that truth which saves; they are
<hi rend="italics">one</hi> in their love of the
<pb id="ward411" n="411"/>
simple gospel, and in bringing forth the fruits of that
gospel in their lives. Thus, for all practical purposes,
the section of the Establishment to which I refer, and
the Dissenting denominations, “walk together,”
because “agreed.”</p>
            <p>Coming from a distant colony, as I do, and knowing
how powerful is the Christian Church of this great
country in moulding the religious character of the
colonies—knowing, too, how much the colonies have
to do with the evangelization of the heathen<ref targOrder="U" id="ref49" n="49" rend="sc" target="note49">*</ref>
<note id="note49" n="49" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref49"><p>* I am among those who believe that the British colonies are both the
agency by which, and the medium through which, the gospel can, ought,
<hi rend="italics">must,</hi> be given to the heathen world. The situation, origin, growth,
progress, language, and relations, of those colonies, all seem, to me, to point
in that direction.</p></note>
contiguous to them—it is impossible for me to express
how deep and thorough was my gratification to find
the religious state of Great Britain what it is, in this
respect: indeed, there is no possibility of exaggerating
the extent of holy influence which must, of necessity,
flow from this all-important fact. The growth of wealth,
increase of power, and widening political influence, of
Britain, being considered, how thankful ought Britons
to be to Britain's God, for the present religious
condition of this mighty empire! As one of the most
obscure of those whose privilege it is to live on British
soil, I beg to express hereby my high and grateful
appreciation of this, the most
<pb id="ward412" n="412"/>
pleasing feature of British society, the most shining
trait of British religious character.</p>
            <p>If I am suspected of forgetting the very lamentable
neglect of religion by too many, of all classes, in these
islands, I have to say, that I do not forget, but
recollect it vividly, as it stands forth in forms and
illustrations most painfully abundant, everywhere.
What I rejoice to know is, that God, in his infinite
mercy, has been pleased to grant to his people here
the power and the privilege of seeing the evils that are
around them, and of holding and wielding the
“spiritual weapons” which, being “mighty through
God,” fully enable them to “demolish the strongholds
of Satan.” I know not of a brighter, more hopeful,
evidence of God's gracious favour to his modem Israel,
than the earnest, simple love of the gospel—than its
being sought for, preached, believed, felt, and
honoured, by all departments and branches of the
British Church. Long may this greatest of blessings be
vouchsafed to them! Long may we of the colonies be
blest with the benefits flowing from it! Widely may it
extend, and may it yield fruits most abundant to the
praise and glory of the Great Head of the Church!</p>
