          <p>LINDLEY MURRAY, the Grammarian, and author of several
excellent School and Reading books, in his last Will bequeathed
certain funds to Trustees in America, his native
country, for several benevolent objects, including the
gratuitous distribution of “books calculated to promote piety
and virtue, and the truth of Christianity.”</p>
          <p>The Trustees have had “The Power of Religion on the
Mind, in Retirement, Affliction, and at the approach of
Death,” stereotyped, and several thousand copies printed and
distributed.</p>
          <p>They also publish the following Narratives compiled by A.
Mott, and M. S. Wood, believing they will prove acceptable
reading to our Colored Americans.</p>

        <head>PHILLIS WHEATLEY.</head>
        <p>IN 1761 John Wheatley's wife went to the slave
market in Boston, for a girl whom she might train to
wait upon her in her old age. At that time ships
were sent from Boston to Africa after cargoes of
slaves, which were sold to the people of Massachusetts.
Among a group of more robust and healthy
children just imported from Africa, the lady observed
one of slender form, suffering from change of climate
and the miseries of the voyage. She, was interested
in the poor little girl, bought her, and took
her home. The child, who was named Phillis, was
almost naked, her only covering being a strip of
dirty carpet; but in a short time the effects of comfortable
clothing and food were visible in her returning health.</p>
        <p>Phillis at the time of her purchase was between
seven and eight years of age, and the intention of her
mistress was to train her as a servant; but the intelligence
which the young girl soon exhibited, induced
her mistress's daughter to teach her to read. Such
was the rapidity with which she learned, that in sixteen
months from the time of her arriving in the
family, the African child had so mastered the English
<pb id="color6" n="6"/>
language, to which she was an utter stranger before,
that she could read with ease the most difficult parts
of the Bible. Her uncommon intellect altered the
intentions of the family regarding Phillis, and she was
kept about the person of her mistress, whose affection
she won by her amiable disposition and pleasing
manners. All her knowledge was obtained without
any instruction, except what was given her in the
family; and in four years from the time she was
stolen from Africa, and when only twelve years of
age, she was capable of writing letters to her friends
on various subjects.</p>
        <p>The young colored girl became an object of very
general attention and astonishment; and in a few
years she corresponded with several persons in high
stations. As she grew up to womanhood, her attainments
kept pace with the promise of her earlier
years; the literary people of Boston supplied her
with books and encouraged her intellectual powers.
This was greatly assisted by her mistress, who treated
her like a child of the family, admitted her to her
own table, and introduced her as an equal to the best
society; but Phillis never departed from the humble
and unassuming deportment which distinguished her
when she stood a little trembling child for sale in
the slave market. She respected the prejudice against
her color, and, when invited to the tables of the great
or wealthy, she chose a place apart for herself, that
none might be offended at a thing so unusual as sitting
at table with a woman of color.</p>
        <pb id="color7" n="7"/>
        <p>Such was the modest and amiable disposition of
Phillis Wheatley. She studied Latin, and her translations
show that she made considerable progress in
it; and she wrote poetry. At the age of fourteen
she appears to have first attempted literary composition,
and by the time she was nineteen the whole
of her printed poems appear to have been written.
They were published in London in 1773 in a small
volume of above 120 pages, containing thirty-nine
pieces, which she dedicated to the Countess of Huntington.
This work has gone through several editions
in England and America.</p>
        <p>Most of her poetry has a religious or moral
bearing; all breathes a soft and sentimental feeling;
many pieces were written on the death of friends. In
a poem addressed to a clergyman on the death of his
wife, some beautiful lines occur:</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“O come away,” her longing spirit cries,</l>
          <l>“And share with me the rapture of the skies.</l>
          <l>Our bliss divine to mortals is unknown,</l>
          <l>Immortal life and glory are our own.</l>
          <l>Here too may the dear pledges of our love</l>
          <l>Arrive, and taste with us the joys above;</l>
          <l>Attune the harp to more than mortal lays,</l>
          <l>And join with us the tribute of their praise</l>
          <l>To Him who died stern justice to atone,</l>
          <l>And make eternal glory all our own.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>A poem on the Providence of God contains the
following:</p>
        <pb id="color8" n="8"/>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“All-wise, Almighty Providence, we trace</l>
          <l>In trees, and plants, and all the flowery race,</l>
          <l>As clear as in the nobler frame of man,</l>
          <l>All lovely ensigns of the Maker's plan.</l>
          <l>The power the same that forms a ray of light,</l>
          <l>That called creation from eternal night.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>From a beautiful address and prayer to the Deity:</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“Great God, incomprehensible, unknown</l>
          <l>To sense, we bow at thine exalted throne.</l>
          <l>0 while we crave thine excellence to feel,</l>
          <l>Thy sacred presence to our hearts reveal,</l>
          <l>And give us of that mercy to partake,</l>
          <l>Which Thou hast promised for the Saviour's sake.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>About the twenty-first year of her age Phillis was
liberated; but she continued in her master's family,
where she was much respected. Her health was delicate,
and her physician having recommended a sea-voyage,
it was arranged that she should visit England.
She had not before been parted from her
adopted mother, and the separation was painful to
both of them.</p>
        <p>Phillis was received and admired in the first circles
of English society, her poems published, and her
portrait engraved. Her countenance appears to have
been pleasing, and her head highly intellectual. The
health of Mrs. Wheatley declined, and she longed for
her beloved companion. On the first notice of her
benefactress's desire to see her, Phillis, whose humility
was not shaken by flattery and attention, re-embarked
<pb id="color9" n="9"/>
for Boston. Within a short time after her return
she stood by the dying bed of her mistress, mother,
and friend, and Phillis Wheatley found herself alone.</p>
        <p>Shortly after the death of her friend she married
a respectable man of her own color, named
Peters. He was a remarkable person—of good character,
a fluent writer, a ready speaker, and altogether
an intelligent, educated man. He was a grocer by
trade, and, as a lawyer, pleaded the cause of his
brethren, the Africans, before the courts. Phillis
was twenty-three at the time of her marriage. The
connection did not prove a happy one, and she being
of a susceptible mind and delicate constitution, fell
into a decline, and died in 1780, about the twenty-sixth
year of her age.</p>

        <head>DELIVERANCE OF A HOTTENTOT FROM A LION.</head>
        <p>A METHODIST missionary named Kay, relates the
following occurrence:</p>
        <p>I visited a poor sick Hottentot in the south of
Africa, who recently experienced one of the most
remarkable and providential deliverances I ever heard
of. I found him in great pain, from the wounds he
had received on that occasion. He gave me a
description of his escape from the jaws of a lion, which
he ascribes wholly to the gracious interposition of the
Father of mercies.</p>
        <pb id="color10" n="10"/>
        <p>About a month ago he went on a hunting excursion,
accompanied by several other natives. On an extensive
plain they found an abundance of game, and discovered
a number of lions, who appeared to be disturbed
by their approach. A very large male lion
began slowly to advance towards the party, many of
whom were young and unaccustomed to such formidable
animals. They all dismounted and prepared
to fire, and, according to custom, began to tie their
horses together by the bridles, with a view to keep
them between themselves and the lion until they were
able to take deliberate aim.</p>
        <p>Before the horses were properly fastened, the monster
made a tremendous bound or two, and suddenly
pounced upon the hind part of one of the horses,
which plunged forward and knocked down the poor
Hottentot. His comrades took flight, and ran off with
all speed. He rose as quickly as possible to follow
them; but no sooner had he regained his feet than
the majestic beast stretched forth his paw, and, striking
him behind the neck, brought him to the ground
again. He then rolled on his back, and the lion set
his foot upon his breast, and lay down upon him.
The poor man now became almost breathless, partly
from fear, but principally from the pressure of his
terrific load. He moved a little to gain air, but,
feeling this, the lion seized his left arm, close to the
elbow, and amused himself with the limb for some
time, biting it in different places, down to the hand.</p>
        <p>All this time the lion did not seem to be angry,
<pb id="color11" n="11"/>
but merely caught at the arm as a cat sports with a
mouse that is not quite dead, so that there was not
a single bone broken, as there would have been if the
lion had been hungry or irritated. While in great
agony, and expecting every moment to be torn limb
from limb, the sufferer cried to his companions for
assistance, but cried in vain. On raising his head a
little, the beast opened his dreadful jaws to receive it,
but his hat only was rent, and points of the teeth only
grazed his skull. The lion set his foot on the arm
from which the blood was freely flowing, his paw was
soon covered therewith, and he again and again licked
it clean, and, with flaming eyes, appeared half inclined
to devour the man.</p>
        <p>“At this critical moment,” said the poor victim,
“I recollected having heard that there is a God in
heaven who is able to deliver at the last extremity,
and I began to pray that He would save me, and not
allow the lion to eat my flesh.” While the Hottentot
was thus engaged in calling on God, the animal
turned himself completely round. On perceiving
this, the man attempted to get from under him, but
the lion became aware of his intention, and laid terrible
hold of his right thigh, which gave excruciating
pain. He again sent up his cry to God for help, nor
were his prayers in vain. The huge creature rose from
his seat, and walked majestically off about thirty or
forty paces, and then lay down on the grass as if to
watch his victim, who ventured to sit up, which
attracted the lion's attention; he made no attack, but
<pb id="color12" n="12"/>
rose, took his departure, and was seen no more.
The man soon arose, took up his gun, and hastened to
his terrified companions, who had given him up for
dead. He was set upon a horse, and taken to the
place where I found him.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gambier hastened to his relief, and thought
the appearance of the wounds so alarming that 
amputation of the arm was absolutely necessary. To this,
however, the man would not consent, as he had a number
of young children, whose subsistence depended on
his labor. “As the Almighty has delivered me,”
said he, “from that horrid death, surely He is able to
save my arm also.” Astonishing to relate, his wounds
are healed, and there is now hope of his ultimate recovery.</p>
      </div1>
      <div1 type="article">
        <head>ANSWER TO PRAYER.</head>
        <p>“I WELL remember,” said the son of a Christian
missionary, “hearing my mother speak in touching
terms of the narrow escapes my father had during our
sojourn in Jamaica. He endured five attacks of yellow
fever, and on one occasion suffered so much that
the medical attendant gave up all hopes of his recovery.
For some time he lingered in a state of insensibility
hardly to be described. My mother watched
and wept; friends did the same; the faithful Christian
colored people also wept as they saw life ebbing
away. Death seemed just about to seize his prey.</p>
        <pb id="color13" n="13"/>
        <p>“Prayer-meetings were held, and at last some hundreds
of negroes were assembled, earnestly beseeching
Almighty God with tears to spare the life of their beloved
missionary. Often had he stood up before
judges in their defence. Often had he been cast into
prison for protecting them from their tyrannical oppressors;
and now, with a warmth of affection and
intensity of feeling unknown amongst Christians in
England, they cried mightily to God. Hour after hour
passed by; messengers were passing from the chapel
to the mission-house to obtain tidings of the sick
man. At length, when his spirit appeared about to
depart and to leave all earthly scenes, the pious negroes
agreed to unite <hi rend="italics">silently</hi> in one heartfelt petition
to Him ‘in whose hand our breath is;’ and believing
that ‘man doth not live by bread only, but by
every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the
Lord,’ they thus silently, unitedly prayed. The multitude
joined in one petition, ascending from their inmost
souls; and at that very hour the shadow of death
was removed at the rebuke of the Lord !</p>
        <p>“A change took place, signs of health appeared, and
he for whom so many supplicants prayed was raised
up from his bed of languishing, and that chapel did
indeed become filled with songs of joy, praise, and
thanksgiving. ‘He lives! he lives!’ was the joyful
exclamation that ran from one to another through
that congregation.”</p>

        <head>FALLACIES RESPECTING THE RACE OF HAM.</head>
        <p>IT is thought by some that the race of Ham, one of
the sons of Noah, had a curse pronounced upon it at
the beginning, whereby through all time this particular
branch of the human family was to be kept in an
inferior and servile condition. This is not correct.
No curse stands recorded in the Bible against the
race of Ham. The curse in question was pronounced
upon Canaan, one of the four sons of Ham, whose
descendants settled in the hill country, called after
his name, along the east end of the Mediterranean
Sea. There they dwelt for several centuries, and
built up a corrupt and idolatrous nation, until they
were dispossessed of their inheritance by the invading
hosts of the Jews. By this invasion vast numbers
of this <sic corr="Canaanite">Canaanitish</sic> race perished, and those who survived
were brought into an abject, dependant, and
servile condition.</p>
        <p>The perversion of the passage is the more
noteworthy from the fact, that while Ham was the
offender, on account of whose conduct the curse was
pronounced—so that, the reader is naturally looking
for some manifestation towards him personally—his
name does not appear. The curse, though three times
repeated, falls steadily upon Canaan, one of the four
sons. When the three sons of Noah came forth with
their father out of the ark, the historian simply says,
<pb id="color15" n="15"/>
“And Ham is the father of Canaan.” True, so he
was, and was also the father of Misraim, and Cush,
and Phut. Shem, too, was the father of five sons, and
Japheth of seven ; but nothing is said at that time
about all these, only, “Ham is the father of Canaan.”
And so also when Ham's irreverent wickedness is
mentioned, it is “Ham the father of Canaan.”</p>
        <p>What is perhaps still more noticeable, when the
curse is passed, and the historian in the next chapter
takes up the genealogy of the race after the flood, and
shows us the first founders of kingdoms and nations,
the only instance in all that long list, when he stops
to give us the boundaries of any people, is in this case
of Canaan. It seems as if God took especial pains to
set the people who were to be cursed, apart from the
rest, that there need be no doubt who they were, and
where they lived.</p>
        <p>But if we take the race of Ham generally, we shall
find that for two thousand years after the flood it
continued by far the most noticeable and conspicuous
of the three branches. For some reason the early
developments of civilization were almost entirely in
this race. Egypt and Assyria, by far the grandest
empires of antiquity, were both of this Hametic order.
Misraim, the son of Ham, is the reputed father of the
one, and Nimrod, the grandson, of the other. So
obvious was this fact, at least as respects Egypt, that
it is familiarly called in the Scriptures “the land of
Ham.” “Israel also came into Egypt , and Jacob
sojourned in the land of Ham.” And again, “He
<pb id="color16" n="16"/>
sent Moses His servant, and Aaron whom He had
chosen. They showed His signs among them, and
wonders in the land of Ham.”</p>

        <head>OLD DINAH.</head>
        <p>DINAH was a slave. Her mistress was an Indian
woman, into whose dark mind not a single ray of gospel
light had ever penetrated. She lived among a
small tribe on the borders of Tennessee, and although
at the age of forty, or a little over, she was called Old
Dinah. The Indian mistress and all her servants had
been baptized by a Roman priest; but why, or wherefore,
none of them knew. Dinah said, in relating the
circumstance, “I allers thought the white folks had
something to tell that we did not know about, and I
used to think what could it be. When the missionaries
come here with the Bible, then I know what it is.”</p>
        <p>Her veneration for the “Good Book,” as she always
called it, was remarkable. Getting on a stool in her
little cabin one day, I noticed on a shelf, far above
the reach of her little ones, a pile of torn, dingy bits
of paper. I said, “What have you here, Dinah?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, missus, don't mind <hi rend="italics">them</hi> now. I picks 'em
up when I come from the meeting. I spose the
children throws 'em out of the school-house, but I
thinks it may be they are pieces of the Good Book,
and when I learns to read I can find 'em out.”</p>
        <pb id="color17" n="17"/>
        <p>Dinah did learn to read. She had a family to provide
for, and Saturday was the only day in the week
allotted to her in which to look after her little patch
of corn and potatoes, cook their food, and prepare her
children for the Sabbath. The morning she gave to
her farming in summer, then the washing and mending,
and at night after the children were washed and
stowed away for sleep, she would take the youngest on
her back, and, tired as she often was, trudge away two
miles to the mission station; and favored indeed was
the teacher who could get rid of the earnest appeal,
“Let me learn just a little more,” before the morning
dawned. Every Sabbath morning a little time was
spent in imparting to her Daniel the lesson of the
previous evening—his master living in a village some
miles distant, so that he could not secure any other
instruction; but Daniel soon outran his teacher, and
having a warm Christian heart, learned to expound
as well as read the Good Book, much to the edification
of his colored friends. This was also an unfailing
source of comfort and grateful recollection to
Dinah. Once when listening to his fervent appeals,
she said to me, while the big tears chased each other
joyously down her cheeks, “Oh, missus, look at Daniel!
I taught that man his a, b, c, and now he knows
so much, and I can only pick out a little of the Good
Book yet.”</p>
        <p>In the preaching of the gospel she took great de-
light, and never but once, during our nine or ten
months among that people, do I remember her being
<pb id="color18" n="18"/>
absent from our meetings on the Sabbath. It was
in the female prayer-meeting that Dinah was invaluable.
Here all her tenderness of conscience, her desire
for instruction, her delicacy and tact in eliciting
it, not only for herself but for the benefit of others
whose spiritual wants she had made her study, and
above all, her meek and earnest supplications, rendered
her a helper never to be forgotten, and I loved her
for the image of my Master shining in her face.</p>

        <head>“NO-ACCOUNT JOHNNY.”</head>
        <docAuthor>BY M. E. SANGSTER.</docAuthor>
        <p>“NO-ACCOUNT JOHNNY” had had a hard time all
his life. He was a poor boy, so homely, and dirty, and
ragged, so nearly idiotic, that few people would look
at him twice. He lived with a French dyer, who had
taught him how to stir the vats at a certain time every
day, and who gave him in return enough corn-bread
and bacon to keep him alive. A damp, ill- smelling
cellar was the place where he spent his days, and his
nights were passed in an equally repulsive attic. To
dodge a blow, to tell a lie, to eat, to sleep, to be glad
in a vague sort of way when the sun shone on him
warmly, these were all the accomplishments of poor
“No-Account Johnny” Long.</p>
        <p>Christmas, with its green boughs and its gifts,
<pb id="color19" n="19"/>
went by, and brought no gift to him. He did wish,
as he heard the other boys tooting away on their tin
horns, that he had one; but as he could not get one by
wishing, he contented himself with turning somersaults
on the pavement. By an unfortunate miscalculation,
he lay bruised and unconscious at the foot of 
the cellar-steps.</p>
        <p>Aunt Lizzie, the washerwoman, at the end of the
court, took him home to her poor little house, and
took care of him till he was well again, for in the fall
he had broken his arm. Her children went to
Sunday-school, and one of them brought his teacher to
see Johnny.</p>
        <p>“Well, my poor little fellow,” said the gentleman,
looking with pity on the thin face, clean now, through
Aunt Lizzie's care, “I see you are sick; what's your
name?”</p>
        <p>“No-Account Johnny!”</p>
        <p>“Johnny! well, Johnny, do you know that Jesus
loves you ?”</p>
        <p>“Never hearn tell of the Mister, I'm no account.
Reckon He don't know me! Missis says I'm no
account nohow!”</p>
        <p>“But that is a mistake, my boy. You are of great
account. You have a soul that can never die. Did
you never know that?”</p>
        <p>“No,” shaking his head; “I don't un'erstand,
Mister.”</p>
        <p>“Was anybody ever good to you, Johnny?”</p>
        <p>“Nobody but Aunt Liz. Aunt Liz been good.”</p>
        <pb id="color20" n="20"/>
        <p>“Well, Jesus is better than Aunt Liz. Jesus is
God. He died for you! He lives up there among
the stars! He loves you, poor No-Account Johnny.
Think of that.”</p>
        <p>The teacher went away. At the door old Aunt
Lizzie thanked him for coming, but said:</p>
        <p>“It's of no use, sir, to teach that boy. He a'nt
right here,” tapping her forehead.</p>
        <p>“Ah! Aunt Lizzie, our blessed Jesus can make him
understand,” said Mr. Allen, as he went away.</p>
        <p>After a few weeks Johnny was able to go back to
the dyeing establishment. The first Sabbath after,
however, he lost his place, for he refused to work, and
astonished his master by saying that he was going to
Sunday-school. Thither he went, and walking up to
Mr. Allen said:</p>
        <p>“Here I am! Tell me more 'bout Jesus; I've
found out a heap since you told me 'bout Him, and
I'm going to be Jesus Christ's Johnny now. No-Account
Johnny's gone off altogether.”</p>
        <p>Nobody could tell how it happened, but that magic
word, “Jesus,” had done wonders for the little
heathen. “He loves me,” he had said to himself
again and again, and then he had listened, with that
unlocked heart, to every word he heard about Jesus,
and had learned a great deal. “No-Account Johnny”
became one of the best scholars in the little
mission-school.</p>

        <head>ZACHARY AND THE BOY.</head>
        <p>ZACHARY was an Indian of the Mohegan tribe, and
belonged to the royal family of his people. He was
one of the best of hunters, never returning empty-handed
from the chase. But he was a poor, miserable
drunkard. He had learned from the white man
how to drink “fire-water,” and had become so fond
of it that he was drunk nearly all the time when he
was not hunting. When he had reached the age of
fifty years, several of his superiors in the tribe died,
leaving only one person between him and the position
of chief.</p>
        <p>One day Zachary was returning from hunting, and
while on his way began to think of his past life and
of his future prospects. “What a fool I have been,”
said he to himself, “having lived so long to act so
foolishly. How can such a drunken wretch as I ever
hope to be the chief of my tribe? What will my
people think and say of me? I am not worthy to fill
the place of the great Uncas. I will drink no more!”</p>
        <p>When he reached his wigwam, he told his wife and
friends that he would never, as long as he lived, taste
any drink but water. And he kept this resolution
to the day of his death.</p>
        <p>Many of the whites who heard this story could not
believe it. They said Zachary had been so long in
the habit of drinking that he could not live without
it, and they had no doubt that he often took a glass
<pb id="color22" n="22"/>
slyly when no one was looking on. Among these
was a young man, the son of the governor of one of
the New England colonies; for this story I am telling 
you is about matters which took place many years
ago, before America was a separate nation, and when
what are now States were called colonies, and governed
by rulers sent over from England.</p>
        <p>Zachary had by this time become the chief in his
tribe, and the governor invited him one day to dine
with him. While they were seated at the table the
governor's son thought he would try the temperance
principles of the old chief, and offering him a glass
of beer, said: “Zachary, this beer is excellent, will
you taste it?”</p>
        <p>The old man dropped his knife and fork, and leaning
over the table, looked with a sharp eye upon the
youth, and said: “John, you do not know what you
are doing! Boy, you are serving the devil! Do
you want to make me what I once was, a poor, miserable
man, unfit to govern my tribe? John, the
acorn grows into an oak; the cub becomes a bear;
the brook swells into a river; and a single spark of
fire will spread through a whole forest. So one drop
of your beer would make me want more, and then I
should want something stronger, and I would drink
rum until I became as wretched as I once was. Do
you not know that I am an Indian? I tell you that
I am; and that if I begin to drink beer I cannot stop
without tasting rum. <hi rend="italics">John, while you live, never
again tempt a man to break a good resolution</hi>.”</p>
        <pb id="color23" n="23"/>
        <p>The young man knew not what to say. He felt
that he had done a mean thing in trying to get old
Zachary to break his pledge. His parents were
deeply affected at the scene, and often reminded their
son of it afterward, charging him never to forget it;
and he did not. For years after the Indian chief
died, John made frequent visits to his grave, repeating
to himself the valuable lesson he had learned,
never to tempt a man to break a good resolution.</p>
        <p>Men, and children too, who are trying to become
better, ought to be helped, not hindered. Kind
words and kind deeds will greatly encourage them;
but to frown upon them, to sneer at them, or to make
sport of them, is often a sure way of making them as
bad as ever.—<hi rend="italics">The Christian</hi>.</p>

        <head>THE WIFE.</head>
        <p>DR. LIVINGSTONE, in his travels in Africa, came
one night to the house of Mozinkwa, a friendly man,
with a pleasant-looking wife and fine family of children,
very “black, but comely.” Perhaps their hospitable,
kind ways made them look handsome to the
lonely missionary, so far from home and friends. He
was caught in a heavy rain, but he and his companions
received a warm welcome and plenty of food
from this friendly couple, till they were able to proceed.</p>
        <pb id="color25" n="25"/>
        <p>They had a large garden, cultivated by the wife,
with yams, sweet potatoes, and other vegetables growing
in it, and all surrounded by a fine hedge of the
banian tree. Under some larger trees, in the middle
of the yard, stood the huts in which they lived, and
no doubt the fine-looking little children played many
happy days under their mother's care in the shade.</p>
        <p>When Dr. Livingstone took his leave of this interesting
family, the wife asked him to bring her some
cloth from the white man's country. When he returned,
after a long journey, he was surprised to find
the pleasant home silent and deserted; the garden
given up to wild weeds, and the huts in ruins, and
no sign of life in the spot where he last saw a large
family of frolicking children. Poor <hi rend="italics">Mozinkwa's wife
was dead</hi> and in her grave under the large trees, while
the huts, garden, and hedge, of which she had been
so proud, were fast going to ruin; for, according to
the custom of that heathen country, a man can never
continue to live where a favorite wife has died. He is
so lonely and sorrowful when he thinks of the happy
times they have had together, that he cannot stay
where everything reminds him of his loss. If ever
he visits the spot again, it is to pray to his dead wife
and make some offering. So for want of a knowledge
of the Friend of Sinners, who binds up the wounded
heart, they must move from place to place, and can
never have any settled villages in that part of the
country.</p>
        <p>How different would the scene have been on Dr.
<pb id="color26" n="26"/>
Livingstone's return, if poor Mozinkwa and his wife
had been <hi rend="italics">Christians</hi>. Then he might have been
happy even in his loneliness, for he would have
prayed to God for strength to bear his loss, and read
the Bible, and taught his children to live so as to
meet their mother in heaven. Instead of flying from
place to place to forget their troubles, those poor Africans
might have permanently happy homes, if they
knew the peace the gospel gives.</p>

        <head>A HOTTENTOT'S LOVE FOR HER TEACHERS,<lb/>
AND THE POWER OF PRAYER.</head>
        <p>DURING the persecution to which the Moravian
missionaries in South Africa were exposed some
years ago, a woman, living about an hour's walk from
the mission house, had a daughter who attended the
school, and had become a Christian. One day this
girl returned home in terror, bringing her little
sister. Her mother inquired the reason; she replied:
“We and our teachers are all to be shot dead,
and I have brought my sister back, that you may at
least keep one child; but as for me, I will return to
my teachers and suffer with them.”</p>
        <p>“What!” said her mother, “do you mean to go
and be killed?”</p>
        <p>“Yes,” replied the poor girl; “for it is written in
the Bible, ‘Whoever will lose his life for my sake,
shall find it.’ ”</p>
        <pb id="color27" n="27"/>
        <p>Her mother was much affected, and taking up her
younger daughter, said, “My child, where you are
there will I be.”</p>
        <p>The party then set off for Bavian's Kloof, weeping
all the way. When they had arrived at the top of
the hill which commanded a view of the settlement,
they saw a number of the natives approaching it, as
if to attack the missionaries. The Hottentot woman
and her children fell upon their knees and cried fervently
to God, beseeching Him to prevent the enemy
from hurting their beloved teachers. When they
again looked up, they saw the men going towards another
plantation, at some distance from the mission.
The woman and children went to Bavian's Kloof, and
found the Hottentots there all in tears, some kneeling,
some prostrate on their faces, crying to God, and
their most urgent prayers seemed to be, “Preserve
the teachers whom Thou hast sent us.”</p>

        <head>SAAT.</head>
        <p>SIR SAMUEL BAKER and his wife made a dangerous
and toilsome journey into the burning regions of
Central Africa. From a book of travel and adventure
published by him we glean such portions as relate to
their faithful servant, Saat, the African boy.</p>
        <pb id="color31" n="31"/>
        <p>When a child of six years old, minding his father's
goats in the desert, Saat was captured by a hostile
Arab tribe, and thrust into a sack, which was placed
on a camel's back, and thus he was carried hundreds
of miles from home. Every time that the poor child
screamed or offered resistance he was threatened that
he would be killed by his cruel captors. Saat shortly
found himself in the hands of a slave-dealer, by
whom he was offered to the Egyptian government as
a drummer-boy, but being too small was rejected.
A fellow slave told little Saat of an Austrian 
mission-house in the very town in which they were, that
would protect and care for him if he could escape to
it. Thither the little boy fled, and found shelter for
some time, gaining such instruction as his mind could
receive, together with other little waifs and strays,
which the missionaries had received at different times.</p>
        <p>Sickness reduced the number of the good men who
had cared for and taught the children, and they found
it necessary to turn adrift the friendless little ones,
who apparently without result had been watched and
tended, and little Saat, “the one grain of gold,” was
a second time without a home. But God guided him
on a good way.</p>
        <p>One evening Sir Samuel Baker and his wife were
sitting in their courtyard on the Nile, when a starved,
miserable boy crept up to them, and crouching in the
dust, begged to be allowed to live with them and be
their boy. They did not take him then, and he came
again the next day, praying them to allow him to
<pb id="color32" n="32"/>
serve them. They endeavored to discourage him by
telling of the long and dangerous journey they were
about to take. Saat was firm; he would go with
them to the end of the world. Touched by the boy's
story they went to the mission to inquire the truth
of it. There an excellent character was given of
him, with the remark that he must have been turned
out by mistake. This determined the traveller to
adopt him. A good washing and a new suit of
clothes made Saat quite respectable, and being
well-disposed he soon made himself useful. Mrs. Baker
taught him to sew, and Sir Samuel gave him lessons
in shooting. When his day's work was done, he was
allowed to sit by his mistress while she told him
stories from the Bible and from the history of Europe.
There was plenty of time for such talk, the long,
weary journey in the Nile boat, which they had just
commenced, enabling that gentle lady to instruct the
poor ignorant boy thrown on her hands. Their native
servants robbed, betrayed, and deserted the travellers
at every turn, but among them little Saat shone as
a bright star, honest, truthful, and devoted to those
who had rescued him from starvation, and he daily
won their love. To him they most probably owed
their lives, as he detected and exposed to them a
plan their servants had agreed on, to seize their
master's arms and leave him in the desert, or murder
him and his wife if they met with resistance.</p>
        <p>This child of the sun seemed to have all the best
points of a happy English boy; he delighted in active
<pb id="color33" n="33"/>
sports and shooting with his light gun. Through
dangers and distresses he was always bright and 
cheerful. Saat was sometimes in mischief, too, and he
spoilt two watches by trying to examine their inside
works. He was very fond of a drum; but a camel
which carried it rolled over and spoilt that musical
instrument; then he destroyed a tin kettle and a tin
cup by drumming on them. Neither watch nor tin-ware
could be replaced when shops were thousands
of miles away. Once, when he was not well, a powder
was given him to take, and he asked if he should eat
the paper it was in.</p>
        <p>Sir Samuel followed his plans for his journey
through all obstacles, and Saat's name is never
mentioned, except in praise. He endured hunger and
thirst, and rejoiced with his kind protectors in the
success of their undertaking. During these years of
travel, sickness and death had visited their little 
band, but as yet the boy had been spared; but on the
homeward journey his time came,—that fearful
sickness, the plague, attacked the vessel in which the
party journeyed: first one was smitten, then another,
and then it was Saat. Mrs. Baker herself nursed
the sick boy with tender care, but he lay day and
night in delirium. At last came a calm; he was
gently washed and dressed in clean clothes, and laid
to rest. He slept; his mistress hoped it was the
sleep of recovery; but a kind servant presently
covered the boy's face while tears ran down her
cheeks. Saat was dead. The boat was stopped, and
<pb id="color34" n="34"/>
the faithful boy was sadly buried beneath a tree, the
wonderful river Nile rolling by his grave.</p>
        <p>Saat was converted from Paganism to Christianity,
and reached his home and rest in heaven.</p>

        <head>THE MISSIONARY BOX.</head>
        <p>A FEW years ago two young Africans went to
England to obtain an education, and then return to
Africa to teach their countrymen the gospel of Jesus
Christ. One of them, George Nicol, while staying
near London, walked a considerable distance. In
his walk he came to Hampstead Heath, from which
he could see the city of London before him. The
principal buildings attracted his attention. A laborer
who was breaking stones on the other side of the
road kept looking at him; no doubt it seemed
strange to him to see a colored man looking at the
view he had himself seen every day for many years
past; and in his eyes, perhaps, the wonder would be
increased by seeing the African dressed like a respectable
Englishman.</p>
        <p>While George Nicol stood gazing on the scene the
laborer kept peeping at him from time to time, but
never thought of speaking. Presently George Nicol
turned to him, and asked in good English, what a
certain building was which he saw in the distance. The
laborer answered civilly that it was St. Paul's Church;
and then replied to several other questions, till he had
<pb id="color36" n="36"/>
pointed out the chief buildings of the great city, which
could be seen from the hill on which they were standing.</p>
        <p>When this was done, after a short pause the African
said: “Well, my friend, you have here a very
large and magnificent city; but, after all, it is not to
be compared to the city of God, the heavenly 
Jerusalem, which I hope you and I will both see one day.”</p>
        <p>If the honest laborer was surprised before, his
astonishment was much greater now.</p>
        <p>“Why,” said he, “do you know anything about
such things?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, thank God,” replied the African, “I am
happy to say I do. It was not always so. I was
once in darkness, and knew nothing of the true God;
but good missionaries from England came, and
taught me about Jesus Christ; and now I live in hope
of one day seeing Him in that beautiful city, the
heavenly Jerusalem, where I shall dwell with Him
forever.”</p>
        <p>By this time the good Englishman had thrown
down the hammer with which he had been breaking
stones. He came across the road, and grasping
Nicol's hand exclaimed, “Why, then, you are one of
them that I have been praying for these twenty years.
I never put a penny into the missionary box without
saying, ‘God bless the colored man.’ ”</p>
        <p>It rejoiced the heart of the good African not a little
to find in the humble stone-breaker a friend who had
taken such a deep interest in the people of Africa.

And if his pleasure was so great, the laborer's was
not less, for he saw in George Nicol an answer to his
prayers, and a sure proof that his missionary money
had not been spent in vain. He felt the truth of the
words, “Cast thy bread upon the waters, for thou shalt
find it after many days.”</p>

        <head>HE NEVER TOLD A LIE.</head>
        <p>MUNGO PARK, in the account of his African travels,
relates that a negro youth was killed by a shot from
a party of Moors. His mother walked before the
corpse, as it was carried home, frantic with grief,
clapping her hands, and declaring her son's good
qualities. “He never told a lie,” cried the bereaved
mother; “ he never told a lie; no, never.”</p>

        <head>DADDY DAVY.</head>
        <p>ONE winter evening, when a little orphan in my
seventh year, I climbed upon my grandfather's knee,
and begged that he would “tell me a story.” The
candles were not yet lighted in the parlor, but the
glowing fire sent forth its red blaze, and its cheering
heat seemed more grateful from a fall of snow, which
was rapidly collecting in piles of fleecy whiteness on
the lawn.</p>
        <pb id="color38" n="38"/>
        <p>I had taken my favorite seat on the evening I have
mentioned, just as a poor negro with scarcely any
covering appeared at the window, and supplicated
charity. His dark skin was deeply contrasted with
the unblemished purity of the falling snow, whilst his
trembling limbs seemed hardly able to support his
shivering frame; and there he stood, perishing in the
land of boasted hospitality and freedom!</p>
        <p>With all the active benevolence which my grandfather
possessed, he still retained the usual characteristics
of the hardy seaman. He discouraged everything
which bore the smallest resemblance to indolence.
The idle vagrant dared not approach his residence; but
he prized the man of industrious habits, however
lowly his station; and his influence was ever extended
to aid the destitute and to right the injured.</p>
        <p>On his first going to sea he had been cabin-boy on
board a Liverpool ship; he afterwards lived several
years in the island of Trinidad, in the West Indies,
where the slaves were rigorously treated. He there
became well acquainted with the colored people, and
now he no sooner saw the dark face of the poor
perishing creature at his window, than he hastily rang
the bell, and a footman entered.</p>
        <p>“Robert,” said he, “go and bring that poor fellow
in here.”</p>
        <p>“Poor fellow, did you say ?” inquired Robert.</p>
        <p>“Yes, yes,” replied my grandfather, “yonder man,
fetch him here to me.”</p>
        <p>The servant quitted the room, and it was not without
<pb id="color39" n="39"/>
some feelings of fear, as well as hopes of amusement
that, a few minutes afterwards, I saw the poor
African stand bowing before the parlor door. The
twilight had faded away, and except the reflection
from the snow, night had thrown its sable shadows
on the scene; but as the bright gleam of the fire shed
its red hue upon the features of the negro, and flashed
upon his rolling eyes, he presented rather a terrific
appearance to my young mind.</p>
        <p>“Come in!” exclaimed my grandfather in a shrill
voice; but the poor fellow stood hesitatingly on the
border of the carpet till the command was repeated
with more sternness than before, and then the
trembling African advanced a few steps towards the
easy-chair in which the veteran was sitting.</p>
        <p>Never shall I forget the abject figure which the poor
creature displayed. He was a tall, large-boned man,
but was evidently bent down under the pressure of
sickness and of want rather than of age. A pair of
old canvas <sic corr="trousers">trowsers</sic> hung loosely on his legs, but his
feet were quite naked. On the upper part of his body
was a striped flannel shirt, one of the sleeves of which
was torn away. He had no covering for his head;
and the snow which had fallen on it having melted in
the warmth of the room, large, transparent drops of
clear water hung glistening on his thick woolly hair.</p>
        <p>His look was inclined downwards, as if fearful of
meeting the stern gaze of my grandfather, who
scanned him with the most minute attention, not 
unmingled with agitation. Every joint of the poor
<pb id="color40" n="40"/>
fellow's limbs shook as if struck with ague, and the
cold seemed to have contracted his sinews; for he
crouched his body together, as if to shrink from the
keen blast. Tears were trickling down his cheek, and
his spirit seemed bowed to the earth by distress.</p>
        <p>“Tell me,” said my grandfather, “what brought
you to England, and what you mean by strolling about
the country here as a beggar ? I may order you to
be put in the stocks.”</p>
        <p>“ Ah, massa,” replied the negro, “buckra never
have stocks in dis country; yet he die if massa neber
give him something to fill hungry stomach.”</p>
        <p>While he was speaking my grandfather was restless
and impatient. He removed me from his knee,
and looked with more earnestness at the poor man,
who never raised his head. “We have beggars
enough of our own nation,” said my grandfather.</p>
        <p>“Massa speak true,” replied the African, meekly;
“distress live everywhere; come like race-horse, but
go away softly, softly.”</p>
        <p>Again my grandfather looked sharply at the features
of the man and showed signs of agitation in his own.
“Softly, softly,” said he, “that's just your cant. <sic corr="I">I
I</sic> know the whole gang of you, but you are not going
to deceive me; now wouldn't you sacrifice me and
all I am worth for a bunch of plantains ? ”</p>
        <p>“Massa have eat the plantains, den,” said the man,
“and yet massa think hard of poor <sic corr="negro">negur</sic> who work to
make them grow. God Almighty send rain—God
Almighty send sun—but God Almighty send <sic corr="negro">negur</sic> too.”</p>
        <pb id="color41" n="41"/>
        <p>“Well, well,” said my grandfather, softening his
voice, “God is no respecter of colors, and we must
not let you starve, daddy; so, Robert, tell the cook
to get some warm broth, and bid her bear a hand
about it.”</p>
        <p>“God forever bless massa,” exclaimed the poor
man, as he listened to the order, and keenly directed
his eye towards the person who had issued it; but
my grandfather had turned his head toward me, so his
face was not seen by the grateful man.</p>
        <p>“So I suppose you are some runaway slave?” said
my grandfather, harshly.</p>
        <p>“No, massa,” rejoined the African, “no, massa;
never run away—I free man. Good buckra give
freedom; but then I lose kind massa, and”—</p>
        <p>“Ay, ay,” replied my grandfather, “but what
about Plantation Joseph, in Trinidad?”</p>
        <p>“Ky!” responded the man, as his eyes were bent
upon his questioner, who again hid his face; “de
buckra knows ebery ting; him like the angel of light
to know the secret of the heart.”</p>
        <p>“Come nearer to the fire, Daddy Davy,” said my
grandfather, as he bent down to stir the burning
coals with the poker.</p>
        <p>Never shall I forget the look of the African; joy,
wonder, and admiration were pictured in his face, as
he exclaimed, while advancing forward—</p>
        <p>“De buckra know my name too!—how dis?”</p>
        <p>My grandfather having kindled a bright flame that
illuminated the whole room, turned his face towards
<pb id="color42" n="42"/>
the African; but no sooner had the poor fellow caught
sight of his features than, throwing himself at his
feet, he clasped the old sailor's knees, exclaiming,
“My own massa!—what for you give Davy him
freedom? and now do poor <sic corr="negro">negur</sic> die for want! but no,
neber see de day to go dead, now me find my massa.”</p>
        <p>“Willie, my boy,” said my grandfather, turning to
me, “fetch my pocket-handkerchief off the sofa.”</p>
        <p>I immediately obeyed, but I used the handkerchief
two or three times to wipe the tears from my eyes
before I delivered it to him.</p>
        <p>At this moment Robert opened the door, and said
the broth was ready, but stood with amazement to
see the half-naked man at his master's feet.</p>
        <p>“Go, Davy,” said my grandfather, “go and get
some food; and, Robert, tell the cook to have a warm
bath ready, and the housemaid must run a pan of
coals over the little bed in the blue room, and put
some extra blankets on. You can sleep without a
nightcap, I dare say, Davy. There, go along, Davy,
go along;” and the gratified negro left the room with
unfeigned ejaculations of “Gor Amighty for eber bless
kind massa!”</p>
        <p>As soon as the door was closed, and I was once
more seated on my grandfather's knee, he commenced
his usual practice of holding converse with himself.
“What could have brought him here?” said he. “I
gave him his freedom, and a piece of land to cultivate.
There was a pretty hut upon it, too, with a double
row of cocoa-nut trees in front, and a garden of
<pb id="color43" n="43"/>
plantains behind, and a nice plot of guinea-grass for a cow,
and another of buckwheat—what has become of it
all I wonder? Bless me, how time flies! it seems
but the other day that I saved the fellow from a
couple of bullets, and he repaid the debt by rescuing
my Betsy—ah, poor dear! She was your mother,
William, and he snatched her from a dreadful and
terrific fate. How these things crowd upon my mind!
The earthquake shook every building to its foundation
—the ground yawned in horrible deformity, and your
poor mother—we can see her gravestone from the
drawing-room window, you know, for she died since
we have been here, and left her old father's heart a
dreary blank. Yet not so either, my child,” pressing
me to his breast and laying his hoary head on mine,
“not so either, for she bequeathed you to my guardian
care, and you are now the solace of my gray
hairs.”</p>
        <p>I afterwards learned that Davy had rescued my
dear mother from destruction, at the risk of his own
life, during an earthquake in Trinidad, for which my
grandfather had given him his freedom, together with
the hut and the land. But he had no protector in
the west: the slaves plundered his property ; sickness
came, and no medical attendant would minister to his
wants without the accustomed fee; he contracted
debts, and his ground was sold to the estate on which
it was situated, to pay the lawyers. He quitted the
island of Trinidad to go to Berbice; but, being wrecked
near Mahaica Creek, on the east coast of
<pb id="color44" n="44"/>
Demerara, he lost his free papers, was seized by the 
government, and sold as a slave, to pay the expense of 
advertising and his keep. He fortunately fell into the
hands of a kind master, who at his death once more
set him at liberty, and he had come to England in the
hope of bettering his condition. But here misfortune
still pursued him: the gentleman whom he accompanied
died on the passage; he could obtain no employment
on his landing; he had been plundered of
what little money he possessed, and had since wandered
about the country till the evening that he implored
charity and found a home.</p>
        <p>My worthy grandfather is now numbered with the
dead; and I love to sit upon his gravestone at the
evening hour; it seems as if I were once more placed
upon his knee, and listening to his tales of bygone
years. But Daddy Davy is still in existence, and
living with me. Indeed, whilst I have been writing,
I have had occasion to put several questions to him
on the subject, and he has been fidgeting about the
room to try and ascertain what I was relating respecting
him.</p>
        <p>“I am only giving a <hi rend="italics">sketch</hi> of my grandfather,
Davy,” said I.</p>
        <p>“<hi rend="italics">Catch</hi>, massa! what he call <hi rend="italics">catch</hi>?”</p>
        <p>“About the schooner, and Trinidad, and the 
earthquake, Davy.”</p>
        <p>“And da old massa what sleep in de <hi rend="italics">Werk-en-rust</hi>?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, Davy, and the snow-storm.”</p>
        <pb id="color45" n="45"/>
        <p>“Ah, da buckra good man! Davy see him noder

        <head>AN AGED CHRISTIAN.</head>
        <p>“ONE afternoon,” writes an American missionary
in Africa, “I went to see old Father Scott, an aged
dying African. He sent me word he would like to
see me. He is in an old dilapidated shanty. A few
boards knocked together, raised about a foot from the
floor, served as a bedstead. The straw bed we made
for him on our first arrival. A little bench, on which
were two Bibles and an earthen jar for water, was all
the furniture he possessed. He is dependent for food
and care on his neighbors, as he is perfectly helpless.</p>
        <p>A woman who was near brought me a stool, and I
sat down beside him. He was delighted to see me;
he told me he had served the Lord for forty years.
He had been a Methodist preacher for many years,
and had often preached three times a day, though he
could never read a word. He would get some boy to
read to him several chapters in the Bible, till he got
hold of just the text that would suit him. I was very
much surprised at his familiarity with the Bible. He
could tell me where to find almost any passage.</p>
        <p>I could not but look at that poor old man, with his
few privileges, and compare them with those of our
more favored people. As I looked at him in his
<pb id="color46" n="46"/>
penury, witnessed his happiness and his implicit faith,
and saw how near home he was, I felt that he was
really to be envied. Who can doubt the power of
Divine grace? I read to him, and talked to him on
the glories of the resurrection, and the mansions our
Saviour has prepared for those who love Him; and
then I left him with the promise of soon seeing him
again. He is almost blind. He begged me not to
forget him in my prayers. He is dying of old age, yet
no one knows how old he is.</p>

        <head>UNCLE JACK.</head>
        <p>HE was a remarkable African slave of Virginia. It
is probable he was brought to James River in the last
slave-ship that brought slaves to that State. Such
was the regard in which he was held that, on the
death of his master, several benevolent persons
subscribed a sufficient sum to purchase his freedom.</p>
        <p>Uncle Jack's talents were of a high order, and his
knowledge of human nature very remarkable. Dr.
Rice, of Richmond, said of him, “The old man's
acquaintance with the Scriptures is wonderful. Many
of his interpretations of obscure passages are singularly
just and striking.” He spoke pure English. A
few anecdotes will convey a good idea of his ready
and apt mode of illustration. A person addicted to
horse-racing and card-playing, stopped Uncle Jack on
<pb id="color47" n="47"/>
the road and said, “Old man, you Christians say a
great deal about the way to heaven being narrow.
Now if this is so, a great many who profess to be
travelling it will not find it half wide enough.”</p>
        <p>“That's very true,” was the reply, “of all that
have merely a name to live, and all like you.”</p>
        <p>“Why refer to me,” said the man; “if the road is
wide enough for any, it is for me.”</p>
        <p>“By no means,” said Uncle Jack. “You will want
to take along a card-table, or a race-horse or two.
Now there is no room along this way for such
things.”</p>
        <p>A man who prided himself on his morality said to
Uncle Jack: “Old man, I am as good as I need to be.
I can't help thinking so, because God blesses me as
much as he does you Christians; and I don't know
what more I want than He gives me.”</p>
        <p>To this the old preacher replied, with great seriousness,
“Just so with the hogs. I have often looked
at them, rooting among the leaves in the woods, and
finding just as many acorns as they needed; and yet
I never saw one of them look up to the tree from
whence the acorns fell.”</p>
        <p>On one occasion some unruly persons undertook to
arrest and whip him, and also several of his hearers,
for holding religious meetings. After the arrest one
of the men thus accosted Uncle Jack, “Well, old fellow,
you are the ringleader of these meetings, and we
have been anxious to catch you; now what have you
to say for yourself?”</p>
        <pb id="color48" n="48"/>
        <p>“Nothing at all, master,” was the reply.</p>
        <p>“What! nothing to say against being whipped!
how is that?”</p>
        <p>“I have been wondering a long time,” said the
old Christian, “how it was that so good a man as the
Apostle Paul should have been whipped three times
for preaching the Gospel, while such an unworthy man
as I am should have been permitted to preach twenty
years without getting a lick.” The young men immediately
released him.</p>
        <p>Uncle Jack died in 1843, aged one hundred years.</p>

        <head>CHRISTIAN KINDNESS.</head>
        <p>IN one of my early journeys, says Moffat, with
some of my companions, we came to a heathen village
on the borders of Orange River, South Africa. We
had travelled far, and were hungry, thirsty, and
fatigued. From the fear of being exposed to lions,
we preferred remaining at the village to proceeding
further during the night. The people of the village
rather roughly directed us to halt at a distance. We
asked for water, but they would not supply it. I
offered the three or four buttons which still remained
on my jacket for a little milk; this also was refused.
We had the prospect of another hungry night at a
distance from water, though within sight of the river.
<pb id="color49" n="49"/>
We found it difficult to reconcile ourselves to our lot;
for in addition to repeated rebuffs, the manner of the
villagers excited suspicion.</p>
        <p>When twilight drew on, a woman approached from
the height beyond which the village lay. She bore
on her head a bundle of wood, and had a vessel of
milk in her hand. The latter, without opening her
lips, she handed to us, laid down the wood, and
returned to the village. A second time she
approached with a cooking-vessel on her head, a leg of
mutton in one hand, and water in the other. She sat
down without saying a word, prepared the fire, and
put on the meat. We asked again and again who she
was. She remained silent until affectionately entreated
to give us a reason for such unlooked-for kindness to
strangers. A tear stole down her sable cheek as she
replied: “I love Him whose servants you are; and
surely it is my duty to give you a cup of cold water in
His name. My heart is full; therefore I cannot speak
the joy I feel to see you in this out-of-the-way place.”</p>
        <p>On learning a little of her history, we found she
was a solitary light burning in a dark place. I asked
her how she kept up the life of God in her soul, in
the entire absence of the communion of saints. She
drew from her bosom a copy of the Dutch New
Testament, which she had received from brother Helm when
in his school several years since, before she had been
compelled by her connections to retire to her present
seclusion. “This,” she said, “is the fountain whence
I drink: this is the oil which makes my lamp burn.”</p>
        <pb id="color50" n="50"/>
        <p>I looked on the precious relic, and the reader may
imagine how I felt, and my companions with me,
when we met with this disciple, and mingled our
sympathies and prayers together at the throne of our
heavenly Father.</p>

        <head>GRATITUDE OF SLAVES.</head>
        <docAuthor>BY DR. LETTSOM.</docAuthor>
        <argument>
          <p>DR. LETTSOM was born in the West Indies, and
inherited fifty slaves, which was all the property his
father left him. He gave freedom to his slaves; and
during a long life, with a large practice as a physician
in London, he kept up a correspondence with some
of those who were indebted to him for their liberty.
When he went to the West Indies to settle his
father's estate, he made a visit to Tortola, and wrote
to a friend as follows:</p>
        </argument>
        <p>“I frequently accompanied Major John Pickering
to his plantations, and as he passed his numerous
negroes saluted him in a loud song, which they
continued as long as he remained in sight. I was also a
melancholy witness to their attachment to him after
his death. He expired suddenly, and when few of his
friends were near him. I remember I held his hand
when the final period arrived, but he had scarcely
breathed his last breath before it was known to his
slaves, and instantly about five hundred of them
surrounded the house and insisted on seeing their master.</p>
        <pb id="color51" n="51"/>
        <p>“They commenced a dismal and mournful yell,
which was communicated from one plantation to
another, till the whole island of Tortola was in
agitation, and crowds of negroes were accumulating
around us. Distressed as I was by the loss of my
relation and friend, I could not be insensible to the
danger of a general insurrection; or, if they entered
the house, which was constructed of wood, and
mounted into his chamber, there was danger of its
falling by their weight and crushing us in its ruins.</p>
        <p>“In this dilemma I had resolution enough to secure
the doors, and thereby prevent sudden intrusion.
After this precaution I addressed them through a
window, assuring them that if they would enter the
house in companies of only twelve at a time, they
should all be admitted to see their deceased master,
and that the same lenient treatment of them should
still be continued. To this they assented, and in a
few hours quiet was restored. It affected me to see
with what silent, fixed melancholy they departed
from the remains of this venerable man.”</p>

        <head>THE SLAVE SHOEMAKER.</head>
        <p>A LADY, who was a Quaker, travelled several
years ago through some of the Southern States on
a gospel mission. When near the borders of North
Carolina, while the horses were being fed, she walked
towards a poor hut, and on entering it saw an aged
<pb id="color52" n="52"/>
man engaged in making shoes. He was very black,
but his hair was white and his countenance thoughtful;
he looked up surprised, and when she asked if
she might come in and sit down, he replied, “Will
mistress sit with me?” She inquired if he was a
slave, and if he had a wife and children. He said,
“If mistress will hear me I will tell her. I have a
wife and four children, but massa sold them into
Georgia.” Wiping his eyes with the sleeve of his
shirt, he continued, “I am a slave, but, mistress, ever
since I got religion God has sweetened my bitter cup,
and made smooth my rough path; my bitter cup was
parting with my wife and children—my rough path
is slavery.”</p>
        <p>She asked him how he got religion. He replied,
“My massa let me go to hear preaching, and I
remember what the minister said.”</p>
        <p>“Can thou read ?”</p>
        <p>“No, mistress, but God helps me remember;
fourteen years ago I got religion; I was bad before;
massa bad too. When I got religion, I was good;
massa was kind too; hard things were made easy;
bitter cups were sweetened. Mistress knows what
that means (looking at her earnestly). I know you
do. Massa gives me work, and I must do it;
nobody comes here, but overseer walks by once a day
to see if I at work; then the rest of the time is my
own; I have one and sometimes two hours.”</p>
        <p>”How does my Christian brother employ his own
time?” asked the lady.</p>
        <pb id="color53" n="53"/>
        <p>“I will tell you, mistress: I shut the door, then
sit down on that bench and wait upon God; and
what good times I have! Sometimes I go to prayer,
and God puts words into my mouth; then other
times something here (laying his hand upon his
breast) tells me not to pray, but to be still—wait
upon God in silence; and did my massa and the
white people know how good I felt, they would be
glad to come and sit with me. In heaven, mistress,
God makes no difference—massa and slave all one.”</p>
        <p>The lady's companions now called for her, and put
an end to this very interesting conversation. His
parting address was: “Farewell, mistress, till we
meet again in heaven. God bless you.” With tears
they parted.</p>

        <head>THE FLIGHT OF A SLAVE.</head>
        <p>JAMES —was born a slave in the State of
Maryland. He was so useful as a blacksmith that
his value was at least one thousand dollars. He was
brought up in total ignorance of letters or of religion,
but he always aimed to be trustworthy. He sought
to distinguish himself in the finer branches of the
business, by invention and finish, making fancy 
hammers, hatchets, etc. One day his master thought
James was watching him improperly, and fell into a
panic of rage. “He came down upon me with his
cane,” said James, “and laid over my shoulders,
arms, and legs about a dozen severe blows, so that
my flesh was sore for several weeks.” He felt the
<pb id="color56" n="56"/>
disgrace of the beating so acutely that he determined
to abscond, and if possible reach the free soil of
Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>One Sunday night, in November, he stole away
into the woods, with only half a pound of Indian
corn-bread to sustain him on his journey, which
would take several days. At three o'clock in the
morning his strength began to fail, his scanty supply
of food afforded poor nourishment, and the only
shelter he could find, without risking travelling by
daylight, was a corn-shock but a few hundred yards
from the road, and there he passed his first day out.
As night came on he pursued his journey; it was
cloudy, and he could not see the north star, which
was his only guide to freedom. His bread was all
eaten, he felt his strength failing, and his mind was
filled with melancholy.</p>
        <p>In this condition he travelled all the night, and
just at the dawn of day he found a few sour apples,
and took shelter under the arch of a bridge, where he
lay in ambush through the day. Night came on, and
he once more proceeded on his wearisome journey.
Frequently he was overcome with hunger and
fatigue, and sat down and slept a few minutes. At
dawn of day he saw a toll-bar, and here he ventured
to ask the best way to Philadelphia, and set off in
the right direction. His taking the open road was
fatal. He was observed by a man, and ordered to
give an account of himself. After a parley, James
took to his heels; but a hue and cry being raised he
<pb id="color57" n="57"/>
was speedily captured. Led to a tavern as a prisoner,
he was questioned. He persisted in saying he
was a free man, but he had no free papers. Though
his story was false, we must remember that he knew
not the wickedness of a lie, for he knew nothing of
God and our Saviour.</p>
        <p>Toward night, being watched only by a boy, he
contrived to slip away, and again took to the woods.</p>
        <p>Wandering in darkness, the north star being covered
with clouds, he was at a loss as to what course
to pursue. “At a venture,” says he, “I struck
northward in search of a road. After several hours
of laborious travel, dragging through briers and
thorns, I emerged from the woods and found myself
wading through marshy ground and over ditches, and
came to a road about three o'clock in the morning.</p>
        <p>“It so happened I came where there was a fork in
the road of three prongs. Which was the right one
for me? After a few moments' parley with myself, I
took the central prong of the road, and pushed on
with all my speed. It had not cleared off, but a
fresh wind had sprung up; it was chilly and searching.
This, with my wet clothes, made me very uncomfortable.”</p>
        <p>He saw a farm with a small hovel-like barn; into
this he went and buried himself in the straw. Here
he lay the whole day; his only danger was from the
yelping of a small dog, and the noise of horsemen who
passed in search of him. He heard them say they
were after a runaway negro, who was a blacksmith,
<pb id="color58" n="58"/>
and that a reward of two hundred dollars was offered
for his recovery. Night came, and he was again on
his way, but all he could do was  to keep his legs in
motion. There came a heavy frost, and he expected
every moment to fall to the ground and perish.</p>
        <p>Coming to a corn-field covered with heavy shocks
of corn, be gathered an ear and then crept into one
of the shocks; he ate as much as he could, expecting
to travel on, but fell asleep, and when he awoke the
sun was shining. He was obliged to conceal himself
as well as he could through the day; he began again
to eat the hard corn, and it took all the forenoon to
eat his breakfast. Night came, and he sallied out,
feeling much better for the corn he had eaten.</p>
        <p>He now believed himself near to Pennsylvania, and
under this impression, skipped and danced for joy.
He says: “A little after the sun rose I came in sight
of a toll-gate; for a moment I felt some hesitation,
but on arriving at the gate I found it attended by
only an elderly woman, whom I afterwards heard was
a widow and an excellent Christian. I asked her if I
was in Pennsylvania. On being informed that I was,
I asked if she knew where I could get employment.
She said she did not, but advised me to go to W. W.,
a Quaker, who lived about three miles from her, and
whom I would find to take an interest in me. In
about half an hour I stood at the door of W. W.
After knocking, the door opened upon a comfortably
spread table. Not daring to enter, I said I had been
sent to him in search of employment.</p>
        <pb id="color59" n="59"/>
        <p>“ ‘Well,’ said he, ‘come in, and take thy breakfast
and get warm.’</p>
        <p>“These words made me feel, in spite of all my fear
and timidity, that I had, in the providence of God,
found a friend and a home. He at once gained my
confidence, and from that day to this, whenever I
discover the least disposition in my heart to disregard
poor and wretched persons with whom I meet, I call
to mind these words: ‘Come in, and take thy breakfast
and get warm.’</p>
        <p>“I was a starving fugitive, without home or
friends, and no claim upon him to whose door I went.
Had he turned me away I must have perished. Nay,
he took me in, and gave of his food, and shared with
me his own garments.”</p>
        <p>By W. W. the wretched wanderer was fed, clothed,
and employed, and not only so, but he was instructed
in reading, writing, and much useful knowledge.
Here, for the first time, did he learn one word of the
truths of religion.</p>
        <p>James resided with the benevolent Quaker for six
months, when it became necessary for him to depart
and go elsewhere. He found employment on Long
Island, opposite New York. By the kindness of
his friends he was educated, and became a Christian
minister and pastor of a colored congregation in
connection with the Presbyterian Church.</p>

        <head>BENJAMIN BANNEKER.</head>
        <p>HE was born in Baltimore County, Maryland, in
the year 1732. There was not a drop of white man's
blood in his veins. His father was born in Africa,
and his mother's parents were both natives of Africa.
What genius he had must be credited to that race.
Benjamin's mother was a remarkable woman. Her
name was Morton before marriage, and her nephew,
Greenbury Morton, was gifted with a lively and
impetuous eloquence which made its mark in his
neighborhood. Her husband was a slave when she
married him, but she soon purchased his freedom.
Together they bought a farm of two hundred acres, which
though but ten miles from Jones' Falls, was at that
time a wilderness.</p>
        <p>When Benjamin was approaching manhood he
attended an obscure country school, where he learned
reading and writing, and a little arithmetic. Beyond
these rudiments he was entirely his own teacher.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the first wonder among his neighbors was
when, at thirty years of age, he made a clock. It is
probable that this was the first clock of which every
portion was made in America. He had seen a watch,
but never a clock; and it was as purely his own 
invention as if none had ever been made before.</p>
        <p>The clock attracted the attention of the Ellicott
family, well educated men, and Quakers. They gave
him books and astronomical instruments. From this
<pb id="color61" n="61"/>
time astronomy became the great object of Benjamin's
life. He remained unmarried, and lived in a cabin on
the farm his father left him; he still labored for a
living, but his wants were few and simple. He slept
much in the day, that he might observe at night the
heavenly bodies, whose laws he was studying. The
first almanac prepared by Banneker was for the year
1792, when he was fifty-nine years old, and he
continued to prepare almanacs till 1802.</p>
        <p>He had become known and respected by scientific
men, and received tokens of regard from many of them.
The Commissioners to run the lines of the District of
Columbia invited Banneker to assist them, and treated
him in all respects as an equal.</p>
        <p>A gentleman writes of Banneker: “When I was
a boy I became very much interested in him, as his
manners were those of a perfect gentleman—kind,
generous, hospitable, humane, dignified, and pleasing
—and he abounded in information on all the various subjects
of the day.” His head was covered with thick white
hair, which gave him a dignified and venerable
appearance. His dress was uniformly of superfine drab
broadcloth, made with straight collar, a long waistcoat,
and broad-brimmed hat. In size and personal
appearance the statue of Franklin, in the Library of
Philadelphia, as seen from the street, is a perfect
likeness of him.</p>

        <head>REPENTANCE AND AMENDMENT IN A<lb/>
COLORED SCHOOL AT CHRISTIANSBURG.</head>
        <p>TWO days since, one of my boys had been behaving
badly all the afternoon. I think I spoke to him
three times during the session, and it seemed to have
no effect; so when five o'clock came, I told him I
would see him after school. When the other scholars
had left, I went and sat down by him, and talked to
him a short time. Among other things, I told him
that I could not teach a boy who would do so badly,
and that I wanted him to kneel down with me, and
I would ask the Lord to watch over him after I had
to give him up. He was crying very hard, and we
knelt down together. When I came to that part of
my prayer, he screamed out, “O Lord! don't let
Miss Lucy turn me out of school. <hi rend="italics">Please</hi>, Lord,
don't let her! I know I have been a bad boy, but I
won't do so any more. Oh! help her to forgive me.
O Jesus! I love to come to school! do forgive me for
being so wicked!” Of course I forgave him. He has
given me no trouble since, and I do not think he will.

Soon afterwards a gentlemen was riding through the

town. He stopped his horse and listened, then
advanced in the direction from which the voices seemed
to come, and looked within the four blackened walls

mansion. There he saw forty colored children seated

singing “The Christian's Home.” They added the

        <head>SOJOURNER TRUTH.</head>
        <p>A MAN and his wife and their children were
brought from Africa to America, and were sold as
slaves. One little girl and her mother kept together,
but the others were so far separated that they never
met again. The little girl's name was Isabella; but
when she grew to be a woman and became a Christian,
she adopted the name of Sojourner Truth.</p>
        <p>She told a lady, “I can remember, when I was a
little thing, how my ole mammy would sit out of doors
in the evenin', an' look up at the stars an' groan.
She'd groan, an' groan, and says I to her:</p>
        <p>“ ‘Mammy, what makes you groan so?’</p>
        <p>“An' she'd say, ‘Matter enough, chile! I'm
groaning to think of my poor children; they don't
know where I be, and I don't know where they be;
they looks up at the stars, an' I looks up at the
stars, but I can't tell where they be.’</p>
        <p>“ ‘Now,’ she said, ‘chile, when you be grown up,
you may be sold away from your mother an' all your
ole friends, an' have great troubles come on ye; an'
when you has these troubles come on ye, ye jes go to
God, an' He'll help ye.’ ”</p>
        <p>Isabella was sold to a hard master and mistress.
<pb id="color66" n="66"/>
She thought she had got into trouble, and she wanted
to find God; she prayed that He would make her
master and mistress better, and as He did not do so,
she concluded they were too bad to be made better,
and that she might leave them. So she rose at three
o'clock one morning, and travelled till late at night,
when she came to a house and went in, “And,” she
said, “they were Quakers, an' real kind they was to
me. They jes took me in, an' did for me as kind as
ef I had been one of 'em, an' I stayed an' lived with
'em two or three years. An' now, jes look here;
instead o' keeping my promise an' being good, as I told
the Lord I would, jest as soon as everything got agoing
easy, I forgot all about God, an' I gin up praying.”</p>
        <p>Sojourner did not long continue in this dark state,
but she found the Lord Jesus, and she said, “I shouted
and cried, Praise, praise, praise to the Lord; an' I
began to feel such a love in my soul as I never felt
before,—love to all creatures. An' then all of a
sudden it stopped; an' I said,  ‘There are the white folks,
that have abused you, an' beat you, an' abused your
people,—think o' them!’ An' then there came
another rush o' love through my soul, an' I cried out
loud, ‘Lord, Lord, I can love even the white folks.
Jesus loved me! I knowed it, I felt it.’ ”</p>
        <p>When slavery was abolished in the State of New
York, Sojourner went back to her old mistress and
demanded her son; he had been sent to Alabama.
After some trouble and expense her son was brought
back to her, though her mistress said to her:</p>
        <pb id="color67" n="67"/>
        <p>“What a fuss you make about a little nigger! got
more of 'em now than you know what to do with.”</p>
        <p>“Sojourner,” said a gentleman, “you seem to be
very sure about heaven.”</p>
        <p>“Well, I be;” she answered triumphantly.</p>
        <p>“What makes you so sure there is any heaven?”</p>
        <p>“Well because I got such a hankering arter it in
here,” she said, giving a thump on her breast with
her usual energy.</p>
        <p>“Sojourner, did you always go by this name?”</p>
        <p>”No, 'deed! My name was Isabella. No, 'deed!
but when I left the house of bondage, I left everything
behind. I want goin' to keep nothin' of Egypt
about me, and so I went to the Lord and asked him
to give me a new name. And the Lord gave me
Sojourner, because I was to travel up an' down the
land, showing the people their sins, an' being a sign
unto them. Afterwards I told the Lord I wanted
another name, 'cause everybody else had two names;
and the Lord gave me <hi rend="italics">Truth</hi>, cause I was to declare
the truth to the people.”</p>
        <p>Wendell Phillips relates a scene of which he was
witness before the abolition of slavery in the United
States. It was in a crowded public meeting in
Faneuil Hall, Boston, where Frederick Douglas was
one of the chief speakers. Douglas had been describing
the wrongs of the colored race, and as he
proceeded he grew more and more excited, and finally
ended by saying that they had no hope of justice from
the whites, no possible hope except in their own right
<pb id="color68" n="68"/>
arms. It must come to blood; they must fight for
themselves, or it would never be done.</p>
        <p>Sojourner was sitting, tall and dark, on the very
front seat facing the platform; and in the hush of
feeling after Frederick sat down, she spoke out in her
deep peculiar voice, heard all over the house:</p>
        <p>“Frederick,<hi rend="italics"> is God dead</hi>?”</p>
        <p>The effect was perfectly electrical, and thrilled
through the whole house, changing as by a flash, the
whole feeling of the audience. Not another word she
said or needed to say, it was enough.</p>
        <p>The following is from a letter from a lady who
visited Freedman's Village, near Washington, where
Sojourner Truth was residing in a little frame building
with the American flag over the door.</p>
        <p>“We found Sojourner Truth, tall, dark, very
homely, but with an expression of determination and
good sense by no means common. She apologized for
her hoarseness, as she had a meeting last evening.
We asked what she had been doing there. ‘Fighting
the devil,’ she said. What particular devil? ‘An
unfaithful man who has undertaken work for which
he is not competent. My people,’ she added, ‘have
fallen very low, and no one need take hold to help
raise them up as a matter of business, it must be done
from love.’ She greatly complained of some one who
had an office in relation to the Freedmen, and said he

not go to the President with her story of the wrong-doing.

        <head>KATY FERGUSON;</head>
        <head>
OR, WHAT A POOR COLORED WOMAN MAY DO.</head>
        <p>ABOUT the year 1774, Katy Ferguson was born.
Her mother was a slave, and was taken from her
young child and sold to another master.</p>
        <p>Uneducated and unaided in her parental duties,
this poor Christian mother had been faithful to the
extent of her abilities, and left upon the mind of her
child indelible religious impressions. Katy, in speaking
of this cruel separation, many years afterward,
said: “Mr. B. sold my mother, and she was carried
away from me; but I remember that before they tore
us asunder, she kneeled down, laid her hand upon my
head, and gave me to God.”</p>
        <p>Katy's active mind sought every opportunity of
acquiring knowledge. Her mother had taught her
much that she herself remembered of the Scriptures.
Other persons had taught her the catechism, and her
retentive memory seldom lost what had been
committed to it.</p>
        <p>In her fifteenth year, the Holy Spirit applied to
her conscience and heart the truths of Scripture which
<pb id="color70" n="70"/>
she had thus received. But when awakened to a
perception of her sinfulness, she felt the need of some
kind <sic corr="counselor">counsellor</sic>.</p>
        <p>Neither master nor mistress had ever encouraged
her to communicate her thoughts on religious
subjects. The minister on whose services she attended,
Dr. John M. Mason, was a man of such a commanding
figure and bearing as to inspire her with fear,
rather than confidence. Yet she knew he was a faithful
servant of Christ, and that he would care for her
soul. She accordingly ventured to call on him. She
remarked afterward, “While I was standing at the
door, after having rung the bell, my feelings were
indescribable. And when the door was opened, and I
found myself in the minister's presence, I trembled
from head to foot. One harsh word or look would
have crushed me.” But this faithful minister of
Christ at once appreciated her solicitude, and in the
gentlest manner inquired, “Have you come here to
talk with me about your soul?” This kind reception
at once relieved and encouraged her to open her whole
heart. The interview was blessed of God to her
conversion. And from that day, her course was remarkably
direct and upward. She was, in a word, an
earnest, self-denying follower of Christ.</p>
        <p>At the age of eighteen, by the aid of friends, she
was made a free woman; and very soon afterwards
married; but her husband and children did not live
long.</p>
        <p>She lived in a part of the city where there were
<pb id="color71" n="71"/>
many very poor families, and many of both colored
and white children who had none to care for their
bodies or souls. Some of these she took to her own
home and taught them to take care of themselves;
and for others she found places, where they would
be provided for. In this way, during her life, she
secured homes for <hi rend="italics">forty-eight</hi> of these neglected and
suffering ones;—thus anticipating one of the
benevolent movements of our time.</p>
        <p>But her concern for the spiritual welfare of those
around her was especially manifest, and in most
appropriate ways. She invited the children to come
into her house every Sabbath day, for religious
instruction. Feeling her own incompetency to instruct
them fully, especially as she was herself unable to
read, she obtained the assistance of other Christian
people in this work. The well-known Isabella Graham
thus aided Katy by occasionally inviting her little
flock to come to her own house.</p>
        <p>Thus Katy's labor of love went on for some time,
unobserved for the most part, even by Christian people,
but not unnoticed by God. He smiled upon her,
and as He often does in the case of humble efforts
like hers, made her little school on the Sabbath the
beginning of a great and good work in that city. It
was about this time that the house of worship on
Murray street, in which Dr. Mason preached, was
built. This good man of God had not forgotten
Katy, the trembling inquirer. Having heard of her
Sabbath assembly of children, he went one day to see
<pb id="color72" n="72"/>
what she was doing. As he entered her lowly dwelling,
and looked around upon the group of interested,
happy-looking faces, he said, with his wonted kindness:
“What are you about here, Katy? Keeping
school on the Sabbath ? We must not leave you to
do all this.” He immediately conferred with the officers
of his church, telling them what he had seen, and
advising that others should join Katy in this good
work. Soon the lecture-room was opened for the
reception and instruction of Katy's charge. This was
the beginning of the Sabbath-school in the Murray
Street Church; and KATY FERGUSON, the colored
woman, who had been a slave, is believed to have
thus gathered THE FIRST SABBATH SCHOOL IN THE
CITY OF NEW YORK.</p>
        <p>But Katy's benevolent heart was not satisfied with
this effort for the good of children. She established and
maintained, during the last forty years of her life, a
weekly prayer-meeting at her house, and during the
last five years of her life, when she could not attend
the public services of divine worship, she made her
own house a Bethel on Sabbath afternoons, by gathering
the neglected children of the neighborhood, with
such others as did not attend at any place of public
worship, and obtaining some suitable person to lead
in the services of prayer and praise.</p>
        <p>The cause of foreign missions was also dear to Katy.
On one occasion, a young man who was about to sail
for Africa as a missionary, was invited to attend a
meeting at her house. Three years afterwards, on
<pb id="color73" n="73"/>
speaking of this man and his associate missionaries,
she said: “For these three years I have never missed
a day but I have prayed for those dear missionaries.”</p>
        <p>The question may occur to some persons, where did
this poor woman procure the means of doing so much
good—clothing children and assisting missionaries?
Uneducated as she was, she possessed extraordinary
taste and judgment. Of a truly refined nature, she
appreciated the beautiful, wherever found. Hence a
wedding, or other festival, in some of the best circles
of New York, could scarcely be considered complete
unless Katy had superintended the nicer provisions
of the table. She was also uncommonly <sic corr="skillful">skilful </sic>in the
cleaning of laces and other fine articles of ladies'
dresses. This constant demand for her services
must, however, be likewise traced, in part, to the
great esteem in which she was held, and to the desire
to furnish her the means of continuing her useful
Christian labors.</p>
        <p>She was a cheerful believer; occupied less in
complaining of her own deficiencies and her troubles, or
boasting of her attainments, than in commending her
Redeemer to others, and in trying to imitate His
active benevolence.</p>
        <p>Thus was this beloved disciple ripening for heaven.
And when death, in that fearful disease, the
cholera, came for her, she was ready, and calmly
expressed her Christian confidence by saying: “Oh, what
a good thing it is to have a hope in Jesus!” Her
last words were, “All is well.”</p>

        <head>POOR POMPEY.</head>
        <p>An old African who had long served the Lord,
when on his death-bed, was visited by his friends, who
came around him lamenting that he was going to die,
saying: “Poor Pompey! poor Pompey is dying.” The
old saint said to them, with much earnestness: “Don't
call me poor Pompey. <hi rend="italics">I</hi>, KING Pompey,” referring to
Revelation i. verse 6.— “<hi rend="italics">And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father</hi>.”</p>

        <head>ANCASS.</head>
        <p>I was born in Africa, about the year 1789; the
country of the Iboes was my home. My father's
name was Durl, and mine, Ancass. My mother was
my father's only wife, and she was the daughter of a
great chieftain. Of four children I was the only son,
and therefore my father's pet. He always liked to
have me near him, and even when he went out to
work he would take me along with him. In the
midst of our ignorance we had a vague idea of the
existence of a Supreme Being, which we know that
every heathen can see from the works of creation.
We called him ‘Thunderer,’ and appealed to him for
aid in case of illness.</p>
        <p>“A young man began to pay us frequent visits,
under pretence of wishing to marry one of my sisters, but
in reality, doubtless, with a view to getting possession
of me, a growing, healthy boy, about twelve years old.
<pb id="color75" n="75"/>
One day my father had gone out, leaving me with my
sisters, and the young man made use of the
opportunity to persuade me to accompany him to a market
in the vicinity, which he described to me in glowing
colors. We walked all that day, and never reached
the place; the night was spent with an acquaintance
of my guide, and our journey continued all the next
day. I was struck by the circumstance that persons
who met us often asked the man what he was going to
do with the boy be had with him, whether he was
intending to sell him, etc. He invariably gave an
assurance of the contrary, but I was soon to learn what
his scheme really was.</p>
        <p>“The end of the journey was reached at last, and
proved to be a trading place on the coast. I lay
down under a large tree, and gazed on the scene with
delight.</p>
        <p>“Suddenly a stranger appeared, and proposed that
I should try a sail in his boat. I was frightened and
refused: but found myself seized by the man's strong
hand, and rapidly dragged away. Then I knew that
I was being taken as a slave. The man who had
brought me from home and sold me to the traders,
looked on unmoved as I was hurried to the water's
edge, and I could only implore him to take a last
message to my dear father, letting him know what
had become of me.</p>
        <p>“There were several negroes already in the boat,
bound with ropes, and others were added. When
the boat put off for the ship I was so exhausted with
<pb id="color76" n="76"/>
crying, that the gentle rocking motion lulled me into
a sound sleep, from which I awoke to find that we
were being lifted into the vessel. The white color of
the captain's face filled me with no less astonishment
than his black, shining feet without toes, as I regarded
his polished boots, which I now saw for the first
time. The next morning I was horrified to see great
numbers of people brought up from the hold on deck,
to be fed with yams and rum. As for myself, I was
heartily glad to be spared this confinement. I was at
liberty to remain on deck with some other boys, slept
in the captain's cabin, and was soon very happy.</p>
        <p>“On reaching Kingston, in Jamaica, the slaves went
ashore, and I looked with intense longing at the
beautiful land, visible from the ship. I was kept on
board for several weeks, and the captain told me I
was destined to be his servant, and should not be
allowed to go ashore. On my declaring, however,
that I was resolved, at all hazards, to leave the vessel,
and would leap overboard if he should try to prevent
me, he changed his mind, and I was sent to a white
man, who took me, with eleven others, into the yard
adjoining his house. We were purchased for the
owner of the estate Krepp, and thither we were taken
without further delay. My companions were sent to
work in the fields; I was retained as servant in the
overseer's family, and called Toby. After the lapse
of a year my master took me as servant into his own
house, making me the companion and play-fellow of
his children, and treating me with great kindness.</p>
        <pb id="color77" n="77"/>
        <p>“About eight years afterwards my master left the
island for England, and I was sent with the children
to the seaport-town, Savana-la-Mar, where we were
to attend the church and school. This was anything
but agreeable to us, and I persisted in neglecting
every opportunity of learning, which I might have
enjoyed. As to the church, I invariably played
outside during the services, and my master's children
were generally with me. In three years' time the
master returned, and took us all back to the estate,
where he soon died. The eldest son became owner of
the property, and he immediately appointed me his
overseer at Krepp, and subsequently at Dumbasken,
when the former estate was sold.</p>
        <p>“In the year 1824 the owner of a neighboring
estate (Paynstown) returned to Jamaica from a visit
in England. This gentleman and his lady were true
Christians. One evening, when passing his plantation
on my way home, I met a female servant of the
family, Christina by name, who was going to draw
water from a neighboring spring. I entered into
conversation with her, and she told me that on Sunday
there would be prayer and singing at Paynstown,
and that her master invited his people to attend. I
asked if strangers were admitted, and was told that
Mrs. Cook had frequently expressed her regret that
no one from the vicinity would come to join them at
prayers, and that strangers would be welcomed, not
only on Sundays, but also in the morning and evening
of the week-days.</p>
        <pb id="color78" n="78"/>
        <p>“This conversation made a deep impression upon
me, and the thought of the prayer-meeting at Paynstown
was continually recurring day and night, until
I at length resolved to go there on the following
Sunday.</p>
        <p>“Sunday came, and I started on my way to Paynstown.
On reaching the house, a negro servant addressed
me in a friendly voice; at the same moment
Mrs. Cook appeared at the door, and I heard her say
to the attendant, on his mentioning my name, ‘Let
him enter; I am glad that he comes!’ Feeling very
shy, I waited outside the hall till a bell gave the
summons for prayers. Mr. Cook conducted the service,
which was commenced with singing a hymn: then a
portion of the Scriptures was read and prayer
offered. I have no recollection of what was read, nor
could I understand the prayer, as I knew nothing of
our Saviour; yet I shall never forget this hour; it
was a turning-point for the whole of my life. I had
a feeling that I was in the presence of Almighty God,
<hi rend="italics">my</hi> Lord and God, and my inmost soul was deeply
moved, while I trembled from head to foot. Unable
to utter a word, I hurried away and remained alone
in my hut.</p>
        <p>“Some time afterwards Mrs. Cooper offered to
teach me to read if I wished to learn, and I gladly
accepted her offer, though exposing myself to no
little ridicule on the part of my fellow-slaves, who
thought it very foolish of me to attempt to learn to
read ‘the white men's book.’ How thankful have I
<pb id="color79" n="79"/>
felt ever since that I was enabled to read the Bible
for myself, and thus come into the enjoyment of a
wonderful privilege!</p>
        <p>“Saturday and Sunday were free days for the
slaves; Sunday was market-day in the neighboring
town, and we negroes were in the habit of cultivating
our own plots of ground on our return from the
service at Paynstown, or carrying their produce to the
market. One Sunday I was so eagerly bent on making
the most out of my garden, that I did not go to
Paynstown, but was busy at work from earliest dawn.
Suddenly the conviction seized my mind that I was
not acting right in the sight of God, in thus digging
and planting in hope of gain. Quite overcome with
the thought, I threw away my hoe, and kneeling in
the hole which I had just dug, I cried aloud to our
Saviour, imploring Him to help me in my darkness,
and show me what I ought to do. The comforting
light was vouchsafed to me at once. While recognizing
my sinful conduct in striving for outward gain to
the detriment of my soul, I was assured that all my
need would be supplied from the bountiful hand of
my heavenly Father, and that the right course for
me was to seek first the kingdom of God and His
righteousness. From that day I never touched a hoe
on Sunday, and I have been so blessed in regard to
externals that I have never suffered any want.</p>
        <p>“Some time afterwards I made a proposal of
marriage to a young woman, whom I had known as one
of the most regular attendants at the services in Mr.
<pb id="color80" n="80"/>
Cooper's house, and she accepted it. My master and
mistress were at first greatly opposed to this step, but
were led eventually to withdraw their prohibition,
and we were married on the 8th June, 1826.</p>
        <p>“A few months afterwards I became a member of
the Moravian Church, one of twelve, who at that
time constituted the whole congregation. Many
others, however, joined the church at Carmel, and
the number of those who desired to cast in their lot
with us as children of God, increased most
surprisingly from week to week.</p>
        <p>“The office of native helper, to which I was soon
afterwards appointed, gave me many opportunities of
telling others what the Lord had done for me, and
directing them to the same Saviour.</p>
        <p>“I had a great desire to purchase my freedom. I
went to my master, who tried to persuade me to
wait, seeing that I should be legally emancipated in
three years' time. My longing for freedom was,
however, so strong that I remained unmoved. I paid
down all my savings, and was soon afterwards able to
complete the required sum, and my certificate of freedom
was signed. O how full my heart was! how
overflowing with thanks and praise to God! This
day has always been to me a day of special rejoicing
and thanksgiving. It was the 1st of June, 1837.</p>
        <p>“Subsequently I was asked by several gentlemen
to undertake the management of their estates, but I
declined, not wishing to fetter myself in such a manner
as would be prejudicial to my work in the Lord's
<pb id="color81" n="81"/>
cause. I was greatly rejoiced when Brother Zorn
proposed to me to devote my time entirely to the
of a native helper receiving £12 a year to
provide subsistence for myself and family. I
purchased a small cottage and piece of ground, and here
I have lived ever since with my dear wife and the
only daughter whom the Lord has been pleased to
give us.”</p>

        <head>A STORM AT SEA.</head>
        <p>SOME few years since, a minister was preaching at
Plymouth, when a request was sent to the pulpit to
this effect: “The thanksgiving of this congregation
is desired to Almighty God, by the captain,
passengers and crew of a West Indiaman, for their
merciful deliverance during the late tempest.”+</p>
        <p>The following day the minister went on board, and
entered into conversation with the passengers, when a
lady thus addressed him: “O, Sir, what an invaluable
blessing is personal religion! Never did I see
it so exemplified as in my poor Ellen during the
storm. When we expected every wave to entomb us
all, my mind was in a horrible state—I was afraid to
die. Ellen would come to me and say, with all
possible composure: ‘Never mind, missie; look to
Jesus Christ. He made—he rule the sea.’ And
<pb id="color82" n="82"/>
when we neared the shore, and were at a loss to know
where we were, fearing every minute to strike on the
rocks, Ellen said, with the same composure as before,
‘Don't fear, missie; look to Jesus Christ—He the
Rock; <hi rend="italics">no shipwreck on that Rock</hi>; He save to the
uttermost. Don't fear, missie; look to Jesus
Christ!’ ”</p>
        <p>The minister wished to see this poor, though rich
African. She was called, and, in the presence of the
sailors, the following conversation took place:</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">Minister</hi>. “Well, Ellen, I am glad to find you
know something of Jesus Christ.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">Ellen</hi>. “Jesus Christ, massa! Oh, He be very
good to my soul! Oh! He be very dear to me.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">Minister</hi>. “How long since you first knew the
Saviour?”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">Ellen</hi>. “Why, some time ago me hear Massa Kitchin
preach about the blessed Jesus. He say to us
colored people—the Lord Jesus come down from the

die; <hi rend="italics">He die, but we no die</hi>. He suffer on the cross—
He spill precious blood for us poor sinners. Me feel
me sinner; me cry; me pray to Jesus, and He save

        <p><hi rend="italics">Minister</hi>. “And when did you see Mr. Kitchin

        <head>“LITTLE WA.”</head>
        <p>THERE is a boy of tender years now in England,
whose story beautifully illustrates the loving care of
God for an affiicted heathen child. He is the son of
an African chief, and two or three years since you
might have seen him playing about his father's and
mother's yard—as happy as the day was long—no kid
frisked so merrily, no kitten was fuller of fun. But
“little Wa” was deaf and dumb, and soon his mother,
“Ti Bla,” was to die, and then his father, “Ta
Qwia,” was to be laid by her side under the palmtree.
God foreknew this, and see how graciously He
provided for this helpless orphan.</p>
        <p>Little Wa was very fond of wandering from home;
and wherever he went, whether to the huts of the
natives or the houses of the colonists, he was a great
favorite, and everybody treated him kindly. He
liked to sport about with those of his own age, and
would amuse the tribes by the hour. Often he came
to the mission station, and the missionary got quite
attached to him, and encouraged him to stay, and
gave him a white shirt—his first civilized suit. This
<pb id="color84" n="84"/>
delighted him, and kept him hovering around for a
week together; then off he trotted to the town.</p>
        <p>By-and-by he reappeared with his shirt dirty, and
the missionary exchanged it for a clean one. “He
seemed so pleased to be with us, and was such a good
boy,” says the missionary, “that pitying his sad case,
I thought I would try and get him into my family.”
He asked his father, who was still an idolater, if he
would let him keep him. His father said, “Yes, he
might keep him if he could.” He meant that “Wa”
was such a gad-about that no one could keep him.
However, the missionary determined to try it. He
had some new clothes made for him, bound with
scarlet; he set him a stool to have his meals, and he
had his own plate and fork, and a snug corner to
sleep in at night, and a warm blanket to wrap
himself in.</p>
        <p>Now, do you suppose that “Wa” stayed with the
missionary, or that he ran away? He stayed, and
he grew fonder and fonder of the missionary and the
missionary of him. Whenever he ate his meals,
before tasting anything, he would bend his head and
shut his eyes, and be still, as if he was saying grace.
So also, night and morning, he would always drop on
his knees, and for a time remain in the attitude of
prayer. Occasionally he would go into the schoolroom,
and sitting beside the girls, take a book, and
make believe that he was studying his lessons. The
missionary would frequently have him in his room,
and kneel down with him, and pray God to teach
<pb id="color85" n="85"/>
him by His Holy Spirit, and deliver him from all
evil. God did indeed watch over him, and preserve
him from danger, to which he was exposed. No lion
was permitted to terrify him; and no scorpion or
serpent was allowed to bite his bare feet. The angels
had charge of him.</p>
        <p>When, on account of his bad health, the missionary
had to leave Africa for a season, he much desired to
bring “little Wa ”to England with him. He had a
talk with his father (his mother was now dead) about
it. He told him what Christian people had done in
England for the deaf and dumb, what attention was
paid to them, and how they were taught to write and
read. He looked very serious, and shook his head.
“I can't let him go;” he said, “I let his brother,
‘Wia,’ go to New York, and he is buried there. I
can't let ‘Wa’ go.” But when he assured him that
England had a milder climate than New York, and
that he would be a parent to him, and that it was
only the child's welfare he sought, “Well,” he said,
“I will consider it.” Shortly after he called and
said, “Take him; do with him what you choose.
He is yours.” So the missionary began at once to
get him ready for sea. He was fitted with red and
yellow flannel smocks and trousers; and when he saw
the preparations, and knew that he was going, he
jumped for joy.</p>
        <p>At length the steamer <sic corr="hovered">hove</sic> in sight. The captain
agreed to charge a shilling a day for the “coal
scuttle,” as he called him. So he was brought off with
<pb id="color86" n="86"/>
them in a boat through the surf, and he bade <foreign lang="fre">adieu</foreign> to
the scenes of his infancy, in better spirits than the
missionary did; but soon the rocking of the ship
upset him. He lay down sick on the deck. When he
recovered, he became a great favorite with the
passengers and crew. He had a wonderful power of
mimicry, and he amused many with his imitations.
Now he would act as he saw the monkeys or the
chimpanzee act; now he would mock the way in
which the gentlemen walked when the vessel rolled;
now he would pretend to be preaching; now he would
dance as his country people do; and now, when a
lady would be moving about alone, he would run up
to her and offer her his arm. The officers would feed
him with good things, and let him sleep in their
state-rooms, though he had a comfortable box of his
own.</p>
        <p>When the missionary arrived at Liverpool, “little
Wa” was an object of curiosity to all. His dark
skin and his flaming-colored dress made him
ridiculously conspicuous. The children in the streets
followed him, and gathered round the shop-doors
pointing at him jeeringly; but whenever they were rude
the missionary said to them, “He is deaf and dumb,”
and then they would say, “Poor boy! poor little
fellow!” You may be sure be was in ecstasies at
the sights, such as he had never even dreamt of.
Especially he noticed the horses, and tried to trot as
they trot; and the sliders on the ice, and when one
tumbled down he was convulsed with laughter. I
<pb id="color87" n="87"/>
have had him at my table, and he behaved himself
like a gentleman, only he would open the whole plate
of sandwiches to see which had least mustard on it;
and when I presented him with a pear, he wanted to
put it into his mouth whole.</p>
        <p>It was decided that he should go into the Bath
Deaf and Dumb Institution. The money, a large
sum, was speedily raised by the ladies of Brighton.
Far and wide contributions flowed in. “Little Wa”
was loaded with presents beside; indeed, ladies began
to be so kind to him that it was high time he was out
of the way of being spoiled. News of his father's
death reached England by the next mail; so now the
missionary felt that “little Wa” was wholly his, and
he took him to Bath without any further doubt as to
its being God's will for him.</p>
        <p>Before “little Wa” left London, he stole into the
missionary's wife's sick chamber, and seeing that
several persons were with her, he sat down quietly
until they withdrew, then he quickly touched her;
and then raising his eyes, he clasped his hands, and
by other signs gave her to understand that he wished
her to pray with him. She did so. On getting up,
he looked into her face so bright and satisfied, and
shook her hand to thank her. As he bade her goodbye,
he signified that after two days and two nights
he would come back to her. When the missionary
was leaving him at the Institution, and broke the
intelligence to him that he must stay there a long while,
“little Wa” was downcast for a moment, but he did
<pb id="color88" n="88"/>
not cry; he nodded his head bravely, and stood
watching him at the door till he turned the corner.</p>
        <p>A recent letter informed us that at first he showed
considerable self-will, but was daily improving. If
we recollect how short a time he has been under
control at all, we cannot but wonder that the wild
African is as tractable as he is. When he saw the
hand-writing of the missionary the tears started, and he
pressed the envelope to his lips.</p>
        <p>Now, my dear young readers, does not this narrative
<hi rend="italics">prove</hi>, that God thinks of children, and loves
them, and cares for them? He is busy with the
affairs of the universe, and yet He can turn from them
to provide for a heathen mute. He dwells in the
high and holy place, and yet He can stoop to be a
friend to the fatherless African boy. Who is a God
like unto Him? Oh, give your heart to Him, that
<hi rend="italics">you</hi>, too, may have His wing spread over you, and be
able to confide in Him for whatever you want.</p>
        <p>May “little Wa's” Almighty protector and
all-loving provider be yours!—<bibl><hi rend="italics">The Family Treasury</hi>.</bibl></p>

        <head>THE AFRICAN SERVANT.</head>
        <p>DURING a residence of some years' continuance in
the neighborhood of the sea, an officer in the navy
called upon me and stated that he had just taken a
lodging in the parish for his wife and children, and
<pb id="color89" n="89"/>
that he had an African whom he had kept three
years in his service.</p>
        <p>“Does he know anything,” I asked, “of the
principles of the Christian religion?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, yes, I am sure he does,” answered the captain;
“for he talks a great deal about it in the kitchen, and
often gets laughed at for his pains; but he takes it
all very patiently.”</p>
        <p>“Does he behave well as your servant?</p>
        <p>“Yes, that he does: he is as honest and civil a
fellow as ever came aboard a ship or lived in a house.”</p>
        <p>“Was he always so well-behaved?”</p>
        <p>“No,” said the officer; “when I first had him he
was often very unruly and deceitful; but for the last
two years he has been quite like another creature.”</p>
        <p>“Well, sir, I shall be very glad to see him, and
think it probable I shall wish to go through a course
of instruction and examination. Can he read?”</p>
        <p>“Yes,” replied his master; “he has been taking
great pains to learn to read for some time past, and
can make out a chapter in the Bible pretty well, as
my maid-servant informs me. He speaks English
better than many of his countrymen, but you will
find it a little broken. When will it be convenient
that I should send him over to you ?”</p>
        <p>“To-morrow afternoon, sir, if you please.”</p>
        <p>“He shall come to you about four o'clock, and you
shall see what you can make of him.”</p>
        <p>With this promise he took his leave. I felt glad
to see him the next day, and asked:</p>
        <pb id="color90" n="90"/>
        <p>“Where were you born?”</p>
        <p>“In Africa. I was very little boy when I was
made slave by the white men.”</p>
        <p>“How was that?”</p>
        <p>“I left father and mother one day at home to go to
get shells by the sea-shore; and, as I was stooping
down to gather them up, some white sailors came out
of a boat and took me away. I never see father nor
mother again.”</p>
        <p>“And what became of you then?”</p>
        <p>“I was put into ship and brought to Jamaica, and
sold to a massa, who keep me in his house to serve
him some years; when about three years ago, Captain
W—, my massa that spoke to you, bought me to
be his servant on board his ship. And he be good
massa; and I live with him ever since.”</p>
        <p>“And what thoughts had you about your soul all
that time before you went to America?” I asked
him.</p>
        <p>“I no care for my soul at all before then. No
man teach me a word about my soul.”</p>
        <p>“Well, now tell me further about what happened
to you in America. How came you there?”</p>
        <p>“My massa take me there in a ship, and he stop
there one month; and then I hear the good minister.”</p>
        <p>“And what did that minister say?”</p>
        <p>“He said I was a great sinner.”</p>
        <p>“Did he speak to you in particular?“</p>
        <p>“Yes, I think so; for there was a great many to
hear him, but he tell them all about me.”</p>
        <pb id="color91" n="91"/>
        <p>“What did he say?”</p>
        <p>“He say all about the things that were in my
heart.”</p>
        <p>“Who taught you to read?”</p>
        <p>“God teach me to read.”</p>
        <p>“What do you mean by saying so?”</p>
        <p>“God gave me desire to read, and that make reading
easy. Massa give me Bible, and one sailor show
me the letter; and so I learn to read by myself with
God's good help.”</p>
        <p>“And what do you read in the Bible?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, I read all about Jesus Christ, and How He
loved sinners; and wicked men killed him, and He
died and came again from the grave and all this for
poor negro. And it sometime make me cry to think
that Christ love me so.”</p>
        <p>Not many days after the first interview with my
African disciple, I went from home on horseback, with
the design of visiting and conversing with him again
at his master's house, which was situated in a part of
the parish near four miles distant from my own. The
road which I took lay over a lofty down or hill, which
commands a prospect of scenery seldom equalled for
beauty and magnificence. It gave birth to silent, but
instructive contemplation.</p>
        <p>As I pursued the meditations which this magnificent
and varied scenery excited in my mind, I approached
the edge of a tremendous perpendicular cliff
with which the hill terminates; I dismounted from
my horse and tied him.</p>
        <pb id="color92" n="92"/>
        <p>I cast my eye downwards a little to the left,
towards a small cove, the shore of which consists of fine
hard sand. It is surrounded by fragments of rock,
chalk cliffs, and steep banks of broken earth. Shut
out from human intercourse and dwellings, it seems
formed for retirement and contemplation. On one of
these rocks I unexpectedly observed a man sitting
with a book, which he was reading. The place was
near two hundred yards perpendicularly below me:
but I soon discovered by his dress, and by the color
of his features, contrasted with the white rocks beside
him, that it was no other than my African disciple,
with, as I doubted not, a Bible in his hand. I
rejoiced at this unlooked-for opportunity of meeting
him in so solitary and interesting a situation. I
descended a steep bank, winding by a kind of rude
staircase, formed by fishermen and shepherds' boys, in
the side of the cliff down to the shore.</p>
        <p>He was intent on his book, and did not perceive
me till I approached very near to him.</p>
        <p>“William, is that you? ”</p>
        <p>“Ah, Massa, I very glad to see you. How came
Massa into this place ? I thought nobody here but
only God and me.”</p>
        <p>“I was coming to your master's house to see
you, and rode round by this way for the sake of
the prospect. I often come here in fine weather
to look at the sea and the shipping. Is that your
Bible?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, sir, this is my dear, good Bible.”</p>
        <pb id="color93" n="93"/>
        <p>“I am glad,” said I, “to see you so well employed;
it is a good sign, William.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, Massa, a sign that God is good to me; but I
never good to God.”</p>
        <p>“How so?”</p>
        <p>“I never thank Him enough; I never pray to Him
enough; I never remember enough who give me all
these good things. Massa, I afraid my heart very
bad. I wish I was like you.”</p>
        <p>“Like me, William? Why, you are like me, a
poor helpless sinner.”</p>
        <p>“Tell me, William, is not that very sin which you
speak of, a burden to you ? You do not love it: you
would be glad to obtain strength against it, and to be
freed from it, would you not?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, yes; I give all this world, if I had it, to be
without sin.”</p>
        <p>“Come then, and welcome, to Jesus Christ, my
brother; His blood cleanseth from all sin. He gave
himself as a ransom for sinners. He hath borne our
griefs, and carried our sorrows. He was wounded
for our transgressions, He was bruised for our
iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon
Him; and with His stripes we are healed. The Lord
hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all. Come, freely
come to Jesus, the Saviour of sinners.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, Massa,” said the poor fellow, weeping, ”I
will come, but I come very slow; very slow, massa;
I want to run; I want to fly. Jesus is very good to
poor me to send you to tell me all this.”</p>
        <pb id="color94" n="94"/>
        <p>I was much pleased with the affectionate manner
in which he spoke of his parents, from whom he had
been stolen in his childhood; and his wishes that
God might direct them by some means to the
knowledge of the Saviour.</p>
        <p>“Who knows,” I said, “but some of these ships
may be carrying a missionary to the country where
they live, to declare the good news of salvation to
your countrymen, and to your own dear parents in
particular, if they are yet alive.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, my dear father and mother; my dear,
gracious Saviour,” exclaimed he, leaping from the ground,
as he spoke, “if Thou would but save their souls, and
tell them what Thou hast done for sinners; but—”</p>
        <p>He stopped and seemed much affected.</p>
        <p>“My friend,” said I,“I will now pray with you
for your own soul, and those of your parents also.”</p>
        <p>“Do, massa, that is very good and kind; do pray
for poor negro souls here and everywhere.”</p>
        <p>This was a new and solemn “house of prayer.”
The sea-sand was our floor, the heavens were our roof.
The cliffs, the rocks, the hills, and the waves, formed
the walls of our chamber. It was not indeed a “place
where prayer was wont to be made,” but for this once
it became a hallowed spot; it will by me ever be
remembered as such. The presence of God was there.
I prayed. The African wept. His heart was full. I
felt with him, and could not but weep likewise.</p>
        <p>The last day will show whether our tears were not
the tears of sincerity and Christian love.</p>
        <pb id="color95" n="95"/>
        <p>I had, for a considerable time, been accustomed to
meet some serious persons once a week, in a cottage
at no great distance from the house where he lived,
for the purpose of religious conversation, instruction,
and prayer. Having found these occasions remarkably
useful and interesting to myself and others, I
thought it would be very desirable to take the African
there, in order that there might be many witnesses to
the simplicity and sincerity of real Christianity, as
exhibited in the character of this promising young
convert. I hoped it might prove an eminent means
of grace to excite and quicken the spirit of prayer and
praise among some over whose spiritual progress I
was anxiously watching.</p>
        <p>It was known that the African was to visit the
little society this evening, and satisfaction beamed in
every countenance as I took him by the hand and
introduced him among them, saying, “I have brought a
brother from Africa to see you, my friends. Bid him
welcome in the name of the Lord.”</p>
        <p>“Sir,” said a humble and pious laborer, whose
heart and tongue always overflowed with Christian
kindness, “we are at all times glad to see our dear
minister, but especially so to-day, in such company
as you have brought with you. We have heard how
gracious the Lord has been to him. Give me your
hand, good friend,” turning to the African; “God be
with you here and everywhere; and blessed be His holy
name for calling wicked sinners, as I hope He has done
you and me, to love and serve Him for His mercy's sake.”</p>
        <pb id="color96" n="96"/>
        <p>Each one greeted him as he came into the house,
and some addressed him in very kind and impressive
language.</p>
        <p>“Massa,” said he, “I not knew what to say to all
these good friends; I think this looks like little
heaven upon earth.”</p>
        <p>He then, with tears in his eyes, which, almost
before he spoke, brought responsive drops into those of
all present, said:</p>
        <p>“Good friends and brethren in Christ Jesus, God
bless you all, and bring you to heaven at last.”</p>
        <p>After some time passed in more general conversation
on the subject of the African's history, I said,
“Let us now praise God for the rich and unspeakable
gift of His grace, and sing the hymn of ‘redeeming
love,’
<q direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“ ‘Now begin the heavenly theme,</l><l>Sing aloud in Jesus' name,’ ” etc.</l></lg></q>
which was accordingly done. Whatever might be the
merit of the natural voices, it was plain there was
melody in all their hearts.</p>
        <p>The African was not much used to our way of singing,
yet joined with great earnestness and affection,
which showed how truly he felt what was uttered.
When the fifth verse was ended—
<q direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“Nothing brought Him from above,</l><l>Nothing but redeeming love”—</l></lg></q>—
he repeated the words, almost unconscious where he
was.</p>
        <pb id="color97" n="97"/>
        <p>“No, nothing, nothing but redeeming love bring
Him down to poor William; nothing but redeeming
love.”</p>
        <p>The following verses were added, and sung by way
of conclusion:</p>
        <q direct="unspecified">
          <lg type="stanza">
            <l>See, a stranger comes to view;</l>

            <l>Come to join the choirs above,</l>
            <l>Singing of redeeming love.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg type="stanza">

        <head>THE BLIND SLAVE IN THE MINES.</head>
        <p>WITH a companion I had descended a thousand
feet perpendicularly, beneath the earth's surface, into
one of the coal mines of East Virginia, called the
MidLothian pit. As we were wandering through its dark
passages—numerous and extensive enough to form a
subterranean city—the sound of music at a little
distance caught our ears. It ceased upon our approach;
but we perceived that it was sacred music, and we
heard the concluding sentiment of the hymn, “I shall
be in heaven in the morning.”</p>
        <pb id="color98" n="98"/>
        <p>On advancing, with our lamps we found the passage
closed by a door, in order to give a different direction
to the currents of air for the purpose of ventilation;
yet this door must be opened occasionally to let the
rail-cars pass, loaded with coal. And to accomplish
this we found sitting by that door an aged blind slave,
whose eyes had been entirely destroyed by a blast of
gunpowder many years before, in that mine. There
he sat, on a seat cut in the coal, from sunrise to
sunset, day after day; his sole business being to
open and shut the door when he heard the rail-cars
approaching. We requested him to sing again the
hymn whose last line we had heard. It was, indeed,
lame in expression, and in poetic measure very defective,
being in fact one of those productions which we
found the pious slaves were in the habit of singing,
in part at least, impromptu. But each stanza closed
with the sentiment, “I shall be in heaven in the
morning.”</p>
        <p>It was sung with a clear and pleasant voice, and I
could see the shrivelled, sightless eyeballs of the old
man rolling in their sockets, as if his soul felt the
inspiring sentiments; and really the exhibition was one
of the most affecting that I have ever witnessed.
There he stood, an old man, whose earthly hopes, even
at the best, must be very faint—and he was a slave—
and he was blind—what could be hope for on earth?
He was buried, too, a thousand feet beneath the solid
rocks. In the expressive language of Jonah, he had
“gone down to the bottom of the mountains; the
<pb id="color99" n="99"/>
earth with her bars was about him for ever.” There,
from month to month, he sat in total darkness.</p>
        <p>I would add, that on inquiry of the pious slaves
engaged in these mines, I found that the blind old man
had a fair reputation for piety, and that it was not
till the loss of his eyes that lie was led to the Saviour.
It may be that the destruction of his natural vision
was the necessary means of opening the eye of faith
within his soul. And though we should shudder at
the thought of exchanging conditions with him on
earth, yet who can say but his peculiar and deep
tribulation here may prepare his soul for a distinction in
glory which we might covet. Oh, how much better to
endure even his deep degradation and privations,
sustained by his hopes, than to partake of their
fortune who live in luxury and pleasure, or riot in
wealth!</p>
        <p>The scene which I have now described affords a
most animating lesson of encouragement to the tried
and the afflicted, and of reproof to the complaining
and discontented.</p>
        <p>Suppose health does fail us, and poverty oppress
us, and our friends forsake us, and our best laid plans
prove abortive, so that a dark cloud settles upon our
worldly prospects—who of us is reduced so low as to
be willing to change places with this poor slave? And
yet he is able to keep his spirits buoyant by the single
hope of future glory. He thinks of a morning that
is to come, when even his deep and dreadful darkness
shall pass away; and the thought has a magic power
<pb id="color100" n="100"/>
to sustain him. If we are Christians, shall not that
same hope chase away our despondency, and nerve us
to bear cheerfully those trials which are far inferior
to his ?</p>

        <head>ANECDOTE.</head>
        <p>A WORTHY old colored woman in the city of New
York was one day walking along the street on some
errand to a neighboring store, with her tobacco-pipe
in her mouth, quietly smoking. A sailor, rendered
mischievous by liquor, came down the street, and when
opposite Phillis, crowded her aside, and with a wave
of his hand knocked her pipe out of her mouth. He
then halted to hear her fret at his trick, and to enjoy
a laugh at her. But what was his astonishment when
she meekly picked up the pieces of her broken pipe,
without the least resentment in her manner, and giving
him a look of mingled sorrow, kindness, and pity,
said: “God forgive my son, as I do.” It touched
a tender part of the young sailor's heart; he felt
ashamed and repented; the tears started in his eyes.
He confessed his error, and thrusting both hands into
his two full pockets of change, forced her to take the
<pb id="color102" n="102"/>
handfuls of money, saying: “God bless you, kind
mother, I'll never do so again.”</p>
      </div1>
      <div1 type="article">
        <head>A LITTLE ACT OF KINDNESS.</head>
        <p>ONE dull night I sat by my window watching the
people as they passed to and from the market. The
wind blew hard, and the rain was beginning to patter
against the window panes, and make large drops on
the pavement.</p>
        <p>Soon I noticed two little colored girls hurrying past
with an empty basket, and I heard one of them say:
“Oh, be quick, for it is going to rain hard, and the
chips will all be wet.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, I'm coming in a minute,” said the other,
who lingered behind—for what purpose, do you
think?</p>
        <p>Leaning against the lamp-post at the corner of the
street was a poor old woman, bent with age and
infirmities. In one hand was her market-basket, in the
other a bundle, and she was trying to open an
umbrella. The wind blew against her, the bundle slipped
from her poor old fingers, rolling into the gutter, and
the umbrella would not come open.</p>
        <p>But the quick feet and fingers of this little girl
soon set things all right. First she hastened to
rescue the bundle, and restore it to its owner; then
opened the umbrella and placed it securely in the
<pb id="color103" n="103"/>
old woman's hands. She waited for no more—
hastening on after her companion; but, amid the falling
rain, I heard the old woman say, “God bless you, my
child!”</p>
        <p>Ah! it was a little deed, but done so cheerfully
and quickly that I knew the child had a kind heart.
Was the act not seen and noticed by our Father in
heaven, and will He not bless the child who helps the
aged and infirm?</p>
        <p>Dear little ones, do not let <hi rend="italics">one chance</hi> of helping

        <head>OLD SUSAN.</head>
        <docAuthor>BY GERTRUDE L. VANDERBILT.</docAuthor>
        <p>“BLESS de Lord, I'm pretty well, and granny's no
wuss.” I heard the voice below my window just as
the dawn of a bright summer day was coloring the
eastern horizon. Then another question was asked by
the cook below, as she threw open the shutters, but I
could only hear old Susan's reply: “No, I can't,
come in; I'm up so airly to look for wood to bile the
kittle. Granny'll be a-wantin' breakfast.”</p>
        <pb id="color104" n="104"/>
        <p>Soon after I saw the poor old woman bent almost
double with the weight of fagots on her back, and her
check apron filled with chips and corn-cobs from the
wood-yard. I raised the sash, and called her:</p>
        <p>“Aunt Susan, do come in! Flora will get your
breakfast, and you can take some home with you for
granny,” said I.</p>
        <p>She lowered the bundle of fagots from her shoulders,
and pushed back the long gingham sun-bonnet, as she
looked up at my window.</p>
        <p>“Bless yer heart, chile, but I couldn't—wouldn't!”
She shook her head very decidedly, and adjusted the
red bandana turban which had been crushed down by
the sun-bonnet. “Ye see, me and granny ain't had
fambly prayers yit this morning. That's it; obliged
to yer jes' the same.”</p>
        <p>I suggested that our Heavenly Father would not
reject prayers that were offered after breakfast. She
looked up at me as I leaned from the window to catch
the glory of the sunrise, and said, with rather a touch
of sadness in her tone:</p>
        <p>“No, chile, yer hadn't oughter think so. De Lord
fust, an' everything else afterwards. Ef ye eat, or of
ye drink, do it all to de glory of God; but it tain't
ter His glory ef yer please yerself fust. I'll be round
biemby; then we 'splain the matter together.” And
reloading her tired shoulders, she tottered off under
her burden.</p>
        <p>This poor colored woman, bent down by her seventy
years of sickness, and poverty, and hard work, and
<pb id="color105" n="105"/>
constant care, had a conscience so tender that nothing
could have induced her to partake of the proffered
meal before she had offered up her morning prayer,
lest the act might seem like want of reverence and
respect.</p>
        <p>This was not an occasional spasmodic outburst of
piety; she seemed always anxious to talk about God,
and, as she could not read herself, to hear others read
about Him. I never knew one who seemed to be in
such constant and close communion with God. In
my visits among the poor, I remember calling at her
door one day, and being obliged to wait some time
after knocking, although I heard her voice within. I
was surprised that she should keep me waiting, for
she had such a delicate sense of the duties of hospitality
that she was particularly careful never to oblige
a visitor to remain standing at her door. I soon
discovered that she was engaged in prayer; one greater
than any earthly guest was with her; it almost seemed
as if she pleaded before one who was visibly present.
She waited and wept, she urged, entreated, and
earnestly pleaded; then gradually her tone changed,
and her voice rose in prayer and loud hallelujahs,
and then she was silent. I knocked once more, and
hastily now she threw open the door; the traces of
tears were still on her cheeks, and in her poor, dim
eyes.</p>
        <p>“Welcome, welcome!” she exclaimed: “come in
De Lord's bin wid me dis day. Praise and bless His
holy name. I'se had sich a blessed time.”</p>
        <pb id="color106" n="106"/>
        <p>Then she dusted the only spare seat her poor room
afforded, and placed it so that as she seated herself
upon her bed she should face me.</p>
        <p>“Oh, chile!” she exclaimed; “de prayers dat's
gone up from dis poor shanty for you and de
Sunday-school! Dey's gone right up from dis poor, low,
mean place, right up through dis old roof, straight up
to de great white throne!” And she clasped her
hands and looked up as if she saw the vision beyond.
“God's holy angels has heard 'em, Jesus's listened to
'em, and God's treasured 'em up, and dey'll come down
in blessin's when old Susan's dead and gone. When
I gits rid of dis mis'able, sickly body, and rises up to
where my prayer's gone before me, oh, how I'll sing
wid de holy angels, praise de Lord, praise de Lord!”</p>
        <p>She used to go off in these rhapsodies frequently;
she had dull prosaic neighbors, who never got excited
over praise or anything else, and they used to say that
old Susan was crazy when she prayed. In alluding
to this she once told me, smiling, that she was going
to ask the Lord to make them crazy in prayer. She
thought a little more earnestness on the subject would
be an improvement. Her faith was so strong that it
seemed to have an element of sublimity in it; it was
grand! The extreme poverty in which she lived, and
her reliance upon others for every comfort in life,
made her realize her dependence upon our Father in
heaven more strongly than those who live in ease and
luxury. She has often said to me, I am poor and
sick, broken down with hard work, crooked and bent
<pb id="color107" n="107"/>
with rheumatism, my wrists are so weak, and my
fingers so stiff, that I can hardly pick up chips; boys
often laugh at me in the street, because when I bend
down I cannot always get up again; sometimes my
fire goes out, and I have nothing to eat until the
Lord sends some kind friend with food. But bless
the Lord I am going home. The Lord is my Father,
and in my Father's house there is plenty; more than
enough. Oh, when I get home! Dear Lord, dear
Lord! When I shall reach my home, I shall forget
all the troubles I have had in this poor shanty.
Looking at her in her poor room, I have often
thought that if possible, heaven would seem more
glorious to her, coming out of distress and misery,
sickness and want, darkness and cold, into the full
blaze of heavenly light.</p>
        <p>She was very grateful to those who paid her rent.
Of one lady in particular, she often spoke to me with
great affection. She said to me once, naming this
lady: “She is to be paid back every cent.” It was
spoken with so much earnestness that I involuntarily
looked around as if I expected to see some one standing
there with the money. She smiled, and told me she
had been reminding God of His promise to pay her
debts.</p>
        <p>I once called on passing, to leave some dinner for
her, she met me at the door, and insisted on my
coming in. “I know'd you was a comin',” she said, “for
I had nothin' t'eat, and I prayed de Lord ter send me
somethin'.”</p>
        <pb id="color108" n="108"/>
        <p>“Well,” I replied, “He has heard your prayer, and
has sent this to you.”</p>
        <p>She placed the dish on her stove to keep warm, and
then she began to talk of prayer. “I does pray fur
you,” she said, “and fur Mr. and Mrs. L., and Miss
C. I prays fur all de world, but the Lord lets us
choose out those who's good to us, and pray fur them
most of all. Mr. L. has been so good, so good to me,
never gettin' tired of being good to me, oh, I do pray
fur him!” She paused, and sat thinking a moment,
and then added: “When Aunt Susan stops a prayin',
she'll be cold and dead.”</p>
        <p>“Aunt Susan” was by no means a gloomy Christian,
she had a sense of humor, and was often very
quick-witted in reply.</p>
        <p>During those terrible riots in New York, in which
so many of her race fell victims to the mob, she fled
to her white friends for protection. Some time after
this, when she was speaking of her faith and her trust
in the Lord, an Irish Roman Catholic taunted her
with having failed to trust in the Lord at that time.
Her reply was very characteristic. “Did you ever
read in the Old Testament of a man named Lot?”
she asked. “Well, Lot showed his faith by running
away, and so did Aunt Susan!” In relating to me
this story, she laughed very heartily, and concluded
by saying: “Yer see as I understan's it, Lot showed
his faith by leavin' home and flyin' accordin' to
the command of der Lord, and Aunt Susan did jes de
same, fur I showed my faith by usin' de means de
<pb id="color109" n="109"/>
Lord hed appinted, and not temptin' de Lord by
stayin' behind. Jes so.”</p>
        <p>Old Susan's “family” consisted of her aged mother,
at that time in her hundred and first year, her dog
Prince, her cat Tom, her hen Toby; a more aged and
decrepit family were surely never before gathered
under one roof. If I had been told that old Dinah's
age was a hundred and twenty, from appearances I
should have been inclined to believe it. Smoking was
the sole recreation which years had left her. Susan
would fill her pipe at intervals during the day, and
after using it, Dinah would sit crazing vacantly around
her until it was refilled and placed in her hand. The
dog, proportionately to canine years, had reached an
equally advanced age with his mistress, and his scabby
back gave him the appearance of having been eaten
by moth. The cat and the hen had reached a greater
age than the time usually allotted to their species;
each would sit for hours perfectly motionless on the
door-step, as if musing on the singing and exhorting
they were constantly hearing within the house from
their old mistress. Susan was very fond of animals,
and seemed to have a curious power in taming and
controlling them. I once told her, that had she lived
earlier, she might have been taken up for a witch,
with Tom and Toby as her familiar spirits.</p>
        <p>Old Susan's faith led her to believe that she could
see the hand of God in even the most trifling events
of life, and that, as He was leading her, and teaching
her through these means, she should be ever on the
<pb id="color110" n="110"/>
watch, so as not to lose the lessons His providence
set in her way. She came to me one day with the
utmost gravity, to tell me of a lesson in resignation.
This pet dog, through some inadvertence, had eaten a
portion prepared for rats; her tender heart was much
troubled by the suffering so carelessly inflicted. Just
before extinguishing her light at night, she turned to
Dinah and—to let her tell her own story, as she told it
to me: “Sez I, granny, look yer last on poor Prince,
fur you'll never see him alive no more. Then it
kinder struck me that I wasn't resigned, so I kneels
down, and sez I, ‘O dear Lord, he's bin a faithful
dog to me. He's watched over my things many a
day when I was out a beggin' for daily bread; he's
bin very faithful, but I gin him up to de Lord. If
de Lord says his time's out, I gin him up. I's
resigned.’ Next mornin' I opens de winders, an'
behold, dere's Prince, jis as well as ever! Sez I,
granny, de Lord has gin him back to me. He was jis
a tryin' my faith! His will is the best fur us all, ye
mus larn dat, granny, dat's the lesson from dis
providence.”</p>
        <p>Old Susan still lives, but her faculties seem
gradually failing, while life yet retains hold in her weak
frame. She is helpless, poor, and old. While earthly
matters seem fading out of her memory, her thoughts
still cling to things above. In my last tract-distributing
visit to her room, I found her holding an open
Testament, with the leaf folded down at the fourteenth
chapter of St. John's Gospel. She cannot read, but
<pb id="color111" n="111"/>
she sat pathetically looking at the text. As I entered,
she exclaimed: “Oh, read it, read it, for me !” It
seemed as if her faith, so sorely tried by her long
waiting, and her earthly sufferings, was for a moment
wavering. As I slowly and distinctly read the words,
“In my Father's house are many mansions,” etc., the
glimmering rays rekindled, her faith re-asserted itself.
“Yes, yes!” she exclaimed, “I knew it was so, I
knew it was written somewhere there; now I
remember it. I'll yet have a home in my Father's
house.” As I looked at the poor, worn-out frame;
the weak, helpless hands; the wrinkled face, and the
dim eyes, my faith could see through these the
glorious spirit that should one day arise and take its
upward flight towards the heavenly mansions.</p>

        <head>POOR SARAH;</head>
        <head><hi rend="italics">Or, Religion Exemplified in the Life and Death of a Pious
Indian Woman</hi>.</head>
        <argument>
          <p>The subject of the following narrative lived and died in a
town in the eastern part of Connecticut. We are well
acquainted with the writer, and we can assure our readers
that the account here given is true.— <bibl> <hi rend="italics">Editor of the
Religious Intelligencer</hi>.</bibl></p>
        </argument>
        <p>IT was a comfortless morning in the month of
March, 1814, when I first formed an acquaintance
with the subject of the following sketch.</p>
        <pb id="color112" n="112"/>
        <p>She called to solicit a few <hi rend="italics">crusts</hi>, meekly saying she
“deserved nothing but the <hi rend="italics">crumbs</hi>—they were enough
for her poor old body, just ready to crumble into
dust.” I had heard of <hi rend="italics">Sarah</hi>, a pious Indian
woman, and I was therefore prepared to receive her
with kindness. And remembering the words of my
Lord, who said, “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto
one of the <hi rend="italics">least</hi> of these my brethren, ye have done it
unto me,” I was ready to impart a portion of my <hi rend="italics">little</hi>
unto her (for little, alas! was my store).</p>
        <p>“And how,” I asked her, “have you got along, this
long, cold winter, Sarah?” O misse,” she replied,
“God better to Sarah than she fear. When winter
come on, Sarah was in great doubt. No husband, no
child here but one; she wicked, gone a great deal.
What if great snow come? What if fire go out?
Nabor great way off. What if sick all 'lone?
What if I die? Nobody know it.</p>
        <p>“While I think so, in my heart, then I cry: while
I cryin', somethin' speak in my mind, and say, ‘Trust
God, Sarah; He love His people, He never leave
them, He never forsake them; He never forsake Sarah,
He friend indeed. Go tell Jesus, Sarah; He love hear
prayer; He often hear Sarah pray.’ So I wipe my
eyes; don't cry any more; go out in bushes, where
nobody see, fall down on my old knees and pray. God
give me great many words; pray a great while. God
make all my mind peace.</p>
        <p>“When I get up, go in house, can't stop prayin' in
my mind. All my heart burn with love to God;
<pb id="color113" n="113"/>
willin' live cold, go hungry, be sick, die all 'lone, if
God be there. He know best; Sarah don't know.
So I feel happy; great many day go singin' hymn—</p>
        <lg type="hymn">
          <l>‘Now I can trust the Lord for ever,</l>
          <l>He can clothe, and He can feed,</l>
          <l>He my rock, and He my Saviour,</l>
          <l>Jesus is a friend indeed.’ ”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>“Well, Sarah, have you been comfortably
supplied?” “O yes,” she replied, “I never out corn
meal once all winter.” “But how do you cook it,
Sarah, so as to make it comfortable food?” “O, I
make porridge, misse. Sometimes I get out, like
today, and I go get some crusts bread and some salt put
in it, then it is so nourishing to this poor old body;
but when can't get none, then make it good I can,
and kneel down, pray God to bless it to me; and I
feel if God feed me, and be so happy here”—(laying
her hand on her heart).</p>
        <p>Oh, what a lesson, thought I, for my repining heart!
“But do you have no meat or other necessaries,
Sarah?” “Not often, misse; sometimes I get so
hungry for it, I begin feel wicked; then think how
Jesus hungry in the desert. But when Satan tempt
Him to sin, to get food, He would not. So I say, Sarah
won't sin to get victuals. I no steal, no eat stole
food, though be hungry ever so long.</p>
        <p>“Then God gives me small look of His self, His <hi rend="italics">Son</hi>,
and His glory; and I think in my heart, they all be
<pb id="color114" n="114"/>
mine soon; then I no suffer hunger any more—my
Father have there many mansions.” “Sarah,” said
I, “you seem to have some knowledge of the Scriptures;
can you read?” “I can spell out a little; I
can't read like you white folks; O, if I could!” Here
she burst into tears.</p>
        <p>But after regaining her composure, she added,
“This, misse, what I want above all things, more than
victuals or drink. Oh, how often I beg God teach me
to read, and He do teach me some. When I take
Bible, kneel down and pray, he show me great many
words, and they be so sweet, I want to know a great
deal more. Oh, when I get home to heaven, then I
know all; no want to read any more.”</p>
        <p>In this strain of simple piety, she told me her first
interesting story. And when she departed, I felt a
stronger evidence of her being a true child of God,
than I have acquired of some professors by a long
acquaintance. In one of the many visits she afterward
made me, she gave me, in substance, the following
account of her conversion:—She lived, according to her
own account, until she became a wife and mother,
without hope and without God in the world, having
been brought up in extreme ignorance.</p>
        <p>Her husband treating her with great severity, she
became dejected and sorrowful, and to use her own
simple language, “I go sorrow, sorrow, all day long.
When the night come, husband come home angry,
beat me so; then I think, Oh, if Sarah had friend!
Sarah no friend. I no want tell nabor I got trouble,
<pb id="color115" n="115"/>
that make only worse. So I be quiet, tell nobody,
only cry all night and day for one good friend.</p>
        <p>“One Sunday, good nabor come, and say, ‘Come
Sarah, go Meetin'.’ So I call my children, tell 'em
stay in house while I go to Meetin'. When got there,
minister tell all about Jesus; how He was born in
stable, go suffer all His life, die on great cross, bury,
rise, and go up into heaven, to be always sinners'
friend. He say, too, if you got trouble, go to the
Lord Jesus. He best friend in sorrow, He cure all
your sorrow, He bring you out of trouble, He support
you, make you willin' suffer.</p>
        <p>“So when I go home, think great deal what minister
say; think this the friend I want—this the friend
I cry for so long. Poor ignorant Sarah never heard
so much about Jesus before. Then I try hard to tell
Jesus how I want such friend. But oh, my heart so
hard, can't feel, can't pray, can't love Jesus, though
he so good. This make me sorrow more and more.</p>
        <p>“When Sunday come, want to go to Meetin' 'gain.
Husband say, ‘You shan't go; I beat you if you go.’
So I wait till he go off huntin', then shut up children
safe, and run to Meetin'; sit down in door, hear
minister tell how bad my heart is—no love to God, no
love to Jesus, no love to pray. So then I see why
can't have Jesus for friend, 'cause got so bad heart:
then go prayin' all way home, Jesus make my heart
better.</p>
        <p>“When got home, find children safe, feel glad
husband no come: only feel sorry 'cause my wicked heart
<pb id="color116" n="116"/>
don't know how make it better. When I go sleep,
then dream I can read good book: dream I read
there, Sarah must be born 'gain. In mornin' keep
thinkin' what that word mean. When husband go
work, run over my good nabor, ask her if Bible say so.</p>
        <p>“Then she read me, where that great man go see
Jesus by night, 'cause 'fraid go in day-time. I think
he just like Sarah. She must go in secret, to hear
'bout Jesus, else husband be angry, and beat her.
Then feel 'couraged in mind, determined to have Jesus
for friend. So asked nabor how get good heart.
She tell me, ‘Give your heart to Jesus, He will give
Holy Spirit, make it better. Sarah don't know what
she mean—never hear 'bout Holy Spirit.</p>
        <p>“She say must go Meetin' next Sunday, she will
tell minister 'bout me—he tell me what to do. So
Sarah go hear how must be born 'gain; minister say,
‘You must go fall down 'fore God; tell Him you
grieved 'cause you sin—tell him you want better
heart—tell him for Christ Jesus' sake give Holy
Spirit, make your heart new.’ Then Sarah go home
light, 'cause she know the way.</p>
        <p>“When get home, husband beat me 'cause I go
Meetin'—don't stay home work. I say, ‘Sarah can't
work any more on Sunday, 'cause sin 'gainst God. I
rather work night, when moon shine.’ So he drive
me hoe corn that night, he so angry. I want to pray
great deal, so go out hoe corn, pray all the time.
When come in house, husband sleep. Then I kneel
down and tell Jesus take my bad heart—can't bear
<pb id="color117" n="117"/>
bad heart; pray give me Holy Spirit, make my heart
soft, make it all new.</p>
        <p>“So great many days Sarah go beg for a new heart.
Go Meetin' all Sundays; if husband beat me, never
mind it; go hear good nabor read Bible every day.
So, after great while, God make all my mind peace. I
love Jesus; I love pray to Him; love tell Him all my
sorrows. He take away my sorrow, make all my soul
joy; only sorrow 'cause can't read Bible—learn how
to be like Jesus; want to be like His dear people
Bible tell of.</p>
        <p>“So I make great many brooms; go get Bible for
'em. When come home, husband call me fool for it;
say he burn it up. Then I go hide it; when he gone,
get it, kiss it many times, 'cause it Jesus' good Word.
Then I go ask nabor if she learn me read; she say,
‘Yes.’ Then I go many days learn letters, pray God
all the while help me learn read His Holy Word.</p>
        <p>“So, misse, I learn read hymn; learn to spell out
many good words in Bible. So every day take Bible,
tell my children that be God's words, tell 'em how
Jesus die on cross for sinner: then make 'em all
kneel down, I pray God give 'em new heart; pray for
husband too, he so wicked. Oh, how I sorry for him;
fear his soul go in burnin' flame.”</p>
        <p>“Sarah,” said I, “how long did your husband
live?” “Oh, he live great many year,” “Did he
repent and become a good man?” “No, misse, I
'fraid not; he sin more and more. When he got sick,
I in great trouble for him; talk every day to him,
<pb id="color118" n="118"/>
but he no hear Sarah. I say, ‘How can you bear go
in burnin' fire, where worm never die, where fire never
go out?’ At last he get angry, bid me hold my
tongue. So I don't say any more, only mourn over
him every day 'fore God.</p>
        <p>“When he die, my heart say, ‘Father, thy will be
done—Jesus do all things well. Sarah can't help him
now, he be in God's hands; all is well.’ So then give
my heart all away to Jesus; tell Him I be all His;
serve Him all my life; beg Holy Spirit come fill all
my heart, make it all clean and white like Jesus.
Pray God help me learn more of His sweet words.</p>
        <p>“And now, Sarah live poor Indian widow great
many long year; always find Jesus friend, husband,
brother, all. He make me willin' suffer; willin' live
great while in this bad world, if He see best. 'Bove
all, He give me great good hope of glory when I die.
So now I wait patient till my change comes.”</p>
        <p>While she was giving this narration, her countenance
bore strong testimony to the diversified emotions
of her soul. I might greatly swell the list of particulars;
but I design only to give the outlines of an
example which would have done honor to the highest
sphere in life; and which, in my opinion, is not the
less excellent, or the less worthy of imitation, because
shrouded in the veil of poverty and sorrow. It was
evident she meditated much on what little she knew
of divine things; and what she knew of the Bible was
to her like honey and the honeycomb.</p>
        <p>She was in the habit of bringing bags of sand into
<pb id="color119" n="119"/>
the village, and selling it to buy food. Sometimes she
brought grapes and other kinds of fruit. But as she
walked by the way, she took little notice of anything
that passed (except children, whom she seldom passed
without an affectionate word of exhortation to be
good, say their prayers, learn to read the Bible, etc.,
accompanied with a bunch of grapes or an apple—thus
engaging the affection of many a little heart), but
seemed absorbed in meditation; and you might often
have observed her hands uplifted in the attitude of
prayer.</p>
        <p>One day, after having observed her as she came, I
asked her how she could bring so heavy loads, old
as she was, and feeble. “Oh,” said she, “when I get
great load, then I go pray God give me strength to
carry it. So I go on, thinkin' all the way how good
God is give His only Son die for poor sinner; think
how good Jesus be, suffer so much for such poor creature;
how good Holy Spirit was, come into my bad
heart, make it all new: so these sweet thoughts make
my mind so full joy, I never think how heavy sand
be on my old back.”</p>
        <p>Here, said I to my heart, learn how to make the
heavy load of iron cares easy. One day she passed
with a bag of sand. On her return she called on me.
I inquired how much Mrs.—gave her for the
sand. She was unwilling to tell, and I feared she was
unwilling lest I should withhold my accustomed
mite, on account of what she had already received;
I therefore insisted she should let me see.</p>
        <pb id="color120" n="120"/>
        <p>She at length consented, and I drew from the bag a
bone, not containing meat enough for half a meal.
“Is this all? Did that rich woman turn you off
so? How cruel, how hard-hearted!” I exclaimed.
“Misse,” she replied, “this made me 'fraid let you
see it; I 'fraid you would be angry: I hope she have
bigger heart next time, only she forget now that Jesus
promise to pay her all she give Sarah. Don't be
angry, I pray God to give her a great deal bigger
heart.”</p>
        <p>The conviction, that she possessed, in an eminent
degree, the Spirit of Him who said, “Bless them that
curse you,” and prayed for His murderers, rushed
upon my mind with energy, and I could compare
myself in some measure to those who said, “Shall we
command fire to come down from heaven,” etc. I
think I never felt deeper self-abhorrence and
abasement; I left her for a moment, and from the few
comforts I possessed, gave her a considerable portion.</p>
        <p>She received them with the most visible marks of
gratitude—arose to depart, went to the door, and then
turned, looking me in the face with evident concern.
“Sarah,” said I, “what would you have?” (supposing
she wanted something I had not thought of, and
she feared to ask). “Oh, my good misse!” said she,
“nothing; only 'fraid your big heart feel some proud
'cause you give more for nothing than Misse—
for sand.”</p>
        <p>This faithfulness, added to her piety and gratitude,
completed the swell of feeling already rising in my
<pb id="color121" n="121"/>
soul; and bursting into tears, I said, “O Sarah!
when you pray that Mrs.—may have a bigger
heart, don't forget to pray that I may have an humbler
one.” “I will, misse, I will,” she exclaimed with
joy, and hastened on her way.</p>
        <p>Another excellence in her character, was, that she
loved the habitation of God's house, and often
appeared there, when, from bad weather or other causes,
many a seat of affluence was empty. She was always
early, ever clean and whole in her apparel, though
sometimes almost as much diversified with patches as
the shepherd's coat.</p>
        <p>She was very old and quite feeble, yet she
generally stood during public service, with eyes riveted
on the preacher. I have sometimes overtaken her on
the steps, after service, and tapping her on her
shoulder, would say, “Have you had a good day,
Sarah?” “All good; sweeter than honey,” she
would reply.</p>
        <p>In the spring of 1818, it was observed by her
friends that she did not appear at Meeting as usual,
and one of her particular female benefactors asked
her the reason; when she, with streaming eyes, told
her that her clothes had become so old and ragged
that she could not come with comfort or decency;
but said she had been praying God to provide for her
in this respect, a great while, and telling Jesus how
much she wanted to go to His house of prayer, and
expressed a strong desire to be resigned and
submissive to His will.</p>
        <pb id="color122" n="122"/>
        <p>This was soon communicated to a few friends, who
promptly obeyed the call of Providence, and soon
furnished this suffering member of Christ with a very
decent suit of clothes. This present was almost
overpowering to her grateful heart. She received them as
from the hand of her Heavenly Father and kind
Redeemer, in answer to her special prayer.</p>
        <p>But this did not in the least diminish her gratitude
to her benefactors; but she said she would go on, tell
Jesus how good His dear people were to this poor old
creature, and pray her good Father to give them great
reward. Two of the garments given her, she received
with every mark of joy. On being asked why she
set so high a value on these, she replied, “Oh, these
just what I pray for so long, so as to lay out my poor
old body, clean and decent, like God's dear white
people, when I die.”</p>
        <p>These she requested a friend to keep for her, fearing
to carry them home, lest they should be taken
from her. She was, however, persuaded to wear one
of them to Meeting, upon condition that if she injured
that, another should be provided; the other was
preserved by her friend, and made use of at her death.</p>
        <p>Thus was this humble band of female friends
honored, by anointing, as it were, the body, beforehand,
to the burial. And I doubt not that her prayer was
heard, and will be answered in their abundant
reward. The last visit I had from her was in the summer
of 1818. She had attended a funeral, and on
returning, she called at my cottage. She complained
<pb id="color123" n="123"/>
of great weariness, and pain in her limbs, and showed
me her feet, which were much swollen.</p>
        <p>I inquired the cause. “Oh,” said she, with a serene
smile, “death comes creeping on; I think in
graveyard to-day, Sarah must lie here soon.” “Well, are
you willing to die? do you feel ready?” “Oh, I
hope, misse, if my bad heart tell true, I willin' and
ready to do just as Jesus bid me. If He say, ‘You
must die,' I to go be with Him; if He say,
‘Live, and suffer great deal more,’ then I willin' do
that; I think Jesus know best.</p>
        <p>“Sometime I get such look of heaven, I long to go
see Jesus; see happy angel; see holy saint; throw
away my bad heart; lay down my old body; and go
where I no sin. Then I tell Jesus; He say, ‘Sarah,
I prepare a place for you, then I come to take you to
myself’ Then I be quite like child, don't want to go
till He call me.”</p>
        <p>Much more she said upon this interesting subject,
which indicated a soul ripe for heavenly glories.
When we parted, I thought it very doubtful whether
we should ever meet again below. In the course of
three weeks I heard Sarah was dead.</p>

        <head>THE GENEROUS NEGRO.</head>
        <p>JOSEPH RACHEL resided in the island of <sic corr="Barbados">Barbadoes</sic>.
He was a trader, and dealt chiefly in the retail way.
In his business, he conducted himself so fairly and
<pb id="color124" n="124"/>
complaisantly, that in a town filled with little
peddling shops, his doors were thronged with customers.
Almost all dealt with him, and ever found him
remarkably honest and obliging.</p>
        <p>If any one knew not where to obtain an article,
Joseph would endeavor to procure it, without making
any advantage for himself. In short, his character was
so fair, and his manners so generous, that the best
people showed him a regard which they often deny
to men of their own color, because they are not
blessed with the like goodness of heart.</p>
        <p>In 1756, a fire happened, which burned down a
great part of the town, and ruined many of the
inhabitants. Joseph lived in a quarter that escaped
the destruction, and expressed his thankfulness by
softening the distresses of his neighbors. Among
those who had lost their property by this heavy
misfortune, was a man to whose family Joseph, in the
early part of his life, owed some obligations.</p>
        <p>This man, by too great hospitality, an excess very
common in the West Indies, had involved himself in
difficulties, before the fire happened; and his estate
lying in houses, that event entirely ruined him.
Amid the cries of misery and want, which excited
Joseph's compassion, this man's unfortunate situation
claimed particular notice. The generous and open
temper of the sufferer, the obligations that Joseph
owed to his family, were special and powerful
motives for acting toward him the part of a friend.</p>
        <p>Joseph had his bond for sixty pounds sterling.
<pb id="color125" n="125"/>
“Unfortunate man,” said he, “this debt shall never
come against you. I sincerely wish you could settle
all your other affairs as easily. But how am I sure
that I shall keep in this in mind? May not the love
of gain, especially when, by length of time, your
misfortune shall become familiar to me, return with too
strong a current, and bear down my fellow-feeling
before it? But for this I have a remedy. Never shall
you apply for the assistance of any friend against my
avarice.”</p>
        <p>He arose, and ordered a large account that the
man had with him, to be drawn out; and in a whim
that night have called up a smile on the face of
Charity, he filled his pipe, sat down again, twisted
the bond and lighted his pipe with it. While the
account was drawing out, he continued smoking, in a
state of mind that a monarch might envy, When it
was finished, he went in search of his friend, with the
discharged account and the mutilated bond in his
hand.</p>
        <p>On meeting him, he presented the papers to him
with this address: “Sir, I am sensibly affected with
your misfortunes: the obligations I have received
from your family give me a relation to every branch
of it. I know that your inability to pay what you
owe gives you more uneasiness than the loss of your
own substance.</p>
        <p>“That you may not be anxious on my account in
particular, accept of this discharge, and the remains
of your bond. I am overpaid in the satisfaction
<pb id="color126" n="126"/>
that I feel from having done my duty. I beg you
to consider this only as a token of the happiness
you will confer upon me, whenever you put it in
my power to do you a good office.”</p>
        <p>The philanthropists of England take pleasure in
speaking of him: “Having become rich by
commerce, he consecrated all his fortune to acts of
benevolence. The unfortunate, without distinction of
color, had a claim on his affections. He gave to
the indigent; lent to those who could not make a
return; visited prisoners, gave them good advice,
and endeavored to bring back the guilty to <hi rend="italics">virtue</hi>.
He died at Bridgetown, on that island, in 1758,
lamented by all, for he was a friend to all.”</p>

        <head>CAPTAIN PAUL CUFFEE.</head>
        <p>PAUL CUFFEE, the subject of this narrative, was
the youngest son of John Cuffee, a poor African
slave; but who, by good conduct, faithfulness, and
a persevering industry, in time obtained his freedom.
He afterward purchased a farm, and having
married an Indian woman, brought up a family of
ten children respectably, on one of the Elizabeth
Islands, near New Bedford, Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>In the year 1773, when Paul was about fourteen
years of age, his father died, leaving a widow with
six daughters to the care of him and his brothers.
<pb id="color127" n="127"/>
Although he had no learning except what he had
received from the hand of friendship, yet by that
means he advanced to a considerable degree of
knowledge in arithmetic and navigation.</p>
        <p>Of the latter, he acquired enough to enable him
to command his own vessel in its voyages to many
ports in the Southern States, the West Indies,
England, Russia, and to Africa. The beginning of his
business in this line was in an open boat; but by
prudence and perseverance, he was at length enabled
to obtain a good-sized schooner, then a brig, and
afterward a ship. In the year 1806, he owned a
ship, two brigs, and several smaller vessels, besides
considerable property in houses and land.</p>
        <p>Feeling in early life a desire of benefiting his
fellow-men, he made use of such opportunities as
were in his power for that purpose. Hence, during
the severity of winter, when he could not pursue his
usual business in his little boat, he employed his time
in teaching navigation to his own family and to the
young men of the neighborhood. Even on his voyages,
when opportunity offered, he instructed those
under his care in that useful art.</p>
        <p>He was so conscientious that he would not enter
into any business, however profitable, that might
have a tendency to injure his fellow-men; and seeing
the dreadful effects of drunkenness, he would not
deal in ardent spirits on that account.</p>
        <p>In the place where he lived, there was no school;
and as he was anxious that his children should obtain
<pb id="color128" n="128"/>
an education, he built a house on his own land, at his
own expense, and gave his neighbors the free use of
it; being satisfied in seeing it occupied for so useful
and excellent a purpose.</p>
        <p>In many parts of his history, we may discover that
excellent trait of character which rendered him so
eminently useful—a steady perseverance in laudable
undertakings. It is only by an honest, industrious
use of the means in our power that we can hope to
become respectable.</p>
        <p>His mind had long been affected with the degraded
and miserable condition of his African brethren, and
his heart yearning toward them, his thoughts were
turned to the British settlement at Sierra Leone. In
1811, finding his property sufficient to warrant the
undertaking, and believing it to be his duty to use a
part of what God had given him for the benefit of his
unhappy race, he embarked in his own brig, manned
entirely by persons of color, and sailed to Africa, the
land of his forefathers.</p>
        <p>After he arrived at Sierra Leone, he had many
conversations with the governor and principal inhabitants,
and proposed to them a number of improvements.
Thence he sailed to England, where he met great attention
and respect; and being favored with an opportunity
of opening his views to the Board of Managers of the
African Institution, they cordially united with him in
all his plans. This mission to Africa was undertaken
at his own expense, and with the purest motives of
benevolence.</p>
        <pb id="color129" n="129"/>
        <p>He was very desirous of soon making another voyage,
but was prevented by the war which took place
between England and the United States. In 1815,
however, he made preparations, and took on board his
brig thirty-eight persons of color; and after a voyage
of thirty-five days, he arrived safe at his destined
port. These persons were to instruct the inhabitants
of Sierra Leone in farming and the mechanic arts.
His stay at this time was about two months, and when
he took his leave, particularly of those whom he had
brought over, it was like a father leaving his children,
and with pious admonition commending them to the
protection of God.</p>
        <p>He was making arrangements for a third voyage,
when he was seized with the complaint which
terminated his labors and his life. He was taken ill in
the winter, and died in the autumn following, 1817,
in the fifty-ninth year of his age. For the benefit of
his African brethren, he devoted a portion of his
youthful acquisitions, of his latter time, and even the
thoughts of his dying pillow.</p>
        <p>As a private man, he was just and upright in all his
dealings. He was an affectionate husband, a kind
father, a good neighbor, and a faithful friend. He was
pious without ostentation, and warmly attached to the
principles of the Society of Friends, of which he was
a member; and he sometimes expressed a few sentences
in their Meetings, which gave general satisfaction.
Regardless of the honors and pleasures of the world,
he followed the example of his Divine Master, in going
<pb id="color130" n="130"/>
from place to place doing good, looking not for a
reward from man, but from his Heavenly Father.</p>
        <p>Thus walking in the ways of piety and usefulness,
and in the enjoyment of all approving conscience,
when death appeared, it found him in peace, and ready
to depart. Such a calmness and serenity overspread
his soul, and showed itself in his countenance, that
the heart of even the reprobate might feel the wish,
“Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my
last end be like his.”</p>
        <p>A short time before he expired, feeling sensible that
his end was near, he called his family together. It was
an affecting and solemn scene. His wife and children,
with several other relations, being assembled around
him, he reached forth his feeble hand, and after embracing
them all, and giving them some pious advice, he
commended them to the mercy of God, and bid them a
final farewell.</p>
        <p>After this, his mind seemed almost entirely occupied
with the eternal world. To one of his neighbors who
came to visit him, he said, “Not many days hence,
and ye shall see the glory of God. I know that my
works are gone to judgment before me; but it is all
well, it is all well.”</p>
        <p>He lived the life, and died the death of a Christian.
He is gone whence he never shall return, and where
he shall no more contend with raging billows and
with howling storms. His voyages are all over, he
has made his last haven, and it is that of eternal
repose. Thither, could we follow him, we should learn
<pb id="color131" n="131"/>
the importance of fulfilling our duty to our Creator,
to ourselves, and to our fellow-creatures.</p>
        <p>Such was his reputation for wisdom and integrity,
that his neighbors consulted him in all their important
concerns; and what an honor to the son of a poor
African slave! And the most respectable men in Great
Britain and America were not ashamed to seek him
for counsel and advice.</p>
        <p>Thus we see how his persevering industry and
economy, with the blessing of Providence, procured him
wealth; his wisdom, sobriety, integrity, and good conduct
made him many friends; his zealous labors for
the honor of his Maker, and for the benefit of his fellow-men,
gave him a peaceful conscience; and an unshaken
belief in the mercies and condescending love of his
Heavenly Father, afforded, in his dying moments, that
calmness, serenity, and peaceful joy, which are a
foretaste of immortal bliss.</p>
        <p>The following is an extract from his address to his
brethren at Sierra Leone:—“Beloved friends and
fellow-countrymen, I earnestly recommend to you the
propriety of assembling yourselves together to worship
the Lord your God. God is a Spirit, and they that
worship Him acceptably, must worship in spirit and
in truth.</p>
        <p>“Come, my African brethren, let us walk in the
light of the Lord; in that pure light which bringeth
salvation into the world. I recommend sobriety and
steadfastness, that so professors may be good examples
in all things. I recommend that early care be taken
<pb id="color132" n="132"/>
to instruct the youth while their minds are tender,
that so they may be preserved from the corruptions
of the world, from profanity, intemperance, and bad
company.</p>
        <p>“May servants be encouraged to discharge their
duty with faithfulness; may they be brought up to
industry; and may their minds be cultivated for the
reception of the good seed which is promised to all who
seek it. I want that we should be faithful in all
things, that so we may become a people giving satisfaction
to those who have borne the burden and heat of
the day in liberating us from a state of slavery.</p>
        <p>“I leave you in the hands of Him who is able to
preserve you, through time, and crown you with that
blessing which is prepared for all who are faithful to
the end.” This appears to be the simple expression of
his feelings, and the language of his heart.</p>
        <p>When you have read this account of your brother
Paul Cuffee, pause and reflect. Do not think because
you cannot be as extensively useful as he was, that
you cannot do any good. There are very few people,
if any, in the world who cannot be useful in some way
or other. If you have health, you may, by your
industry, sobriety, and economy, make yourselves and
your families comfortable.</p>
        <p>By your honesty and good conduct, you may set
them and your neighbors a good example. If you have
aged parents, you may soothe and comfort their declining
years. If you have children, you may instruct
them in piety and virtue, and in such business as will
<pb id="color133" n="133"/>
procure them a comfortable subsistence, and prepare
them for usefulness in the world.</p>

        <head>SOLOMON BAYLEY.</head>
        <p>IN the narrative of his own life, Solomon Bayley
says: “The Lord tried to teach me His fear when I
was a little but I delighted in vanity and foolishness,
and went astray; but He found out a way to
overcome me, and to cause me to desire His favor and
His great help; and although I thought no one could
be more unworthy of His favor, yet He did look on
me, and pity me in my great distress.</p>
        <p>“I was born a slave in the State of Delaware, and
was one of those that were carried out of Delaware
into the State of Virginia; the laws of Delaware did
say, that slaves carried out of that State should be
free; and I asserted my right to freedom, for which
I was put on board of a vessel and sent to Richmond,
where I was put in jail, and in irons, and thence sent
in a wagon back into the country.</p>
        <p>“On the third day after we left Richmond, in the
bitterness of my heart, I was induced to say, ‘I am
past all hope;’ but it pleased the Father of mercy
to look upon me, and He sent a strengthening
thought into my heart—that He that made the
heavens and the earth was able to deliver me. I
looked up to the sky, and then on the trees and the
<pb id="color134" n="134"/>
ground, and I believed, in a moment, that if He
could make all these, He was able to deliver me.</p>
        <p>“Then did that Scripture come into my mind,
‘They that trust in the Lord shall never be
confounded.’ I believed it, and got out of the wagon
unperceived, and went into the bushes. There were
three wagons in company: when they missed me,
they looked round some time for me, but not finding
me, they went on; and that night I travelled
through thunder, lightning, and rain, a considerable
distance.”</p>
        <p>His trials and difficulties in getting along were
many and various; but at Petersburg he met a
man from his neighborhood, circumstanced like himself:
they got a small boat, went down James River,
and landed on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay,
and travelled to Hunting Creek, where their wives
were. “But,” says he, “we found little or no
satisfaction, for we were hunted like partridges on the
mountains.”</p>
        <p>His poor companion, being threatened again with
slavery, in attempting to escape, was pursued and
killed; on which Solomon makes the following
remarks: “Now, reader, you have heard of the end
of my fellow-sufferer, but I remain as yet a
monument of mercy, thrown up and down on life's
tempestuous sea; sometimes feeling an earnest desire to
go away and be at rest; but I travail on, in hopes
of overcoming at my last combat.</p>
        <p>“It being thought best for me to leave Virginia,
<pb id="color135" n="135"/>
I went to Dover, in Delaware, the distance of about
one hundred and twenty miles.” By travelling in
the night, and laying by in the day-time, he at length
reached that place, but not without great difficulty,
from being hunted and pursued.</p>
        <p>In concluding this part of his narrative, he says,
“Oh, what pains God takes to help His otherwise
helpless creatures! Oh, that His kindness and care
were more considered and laid to heart! and then
there would not be that cause to complain that ‘the
ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's
crib, but Israel doth not know, my people doth not
consider;’ but they would see that they are of
more value than many sparrows; and that they are
not their own, but bought with a price. Now, unto
the King immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be
glory and honor, dominion and power, now and
forever. Amen.”</p>
        <p>In the second part of his narrative, he proceeds
by remarking “Seventh month, 24th, 1799, I got
to Camden, where my master soon came from
Virginia and found me, though he had not seen me
since he put me on board the back-country wagon,
nearly three or four hundred miles from Camden.
Upon first sight, he asked me what I was going to do.
I said, ‘Now, master, I have suffered a great deal,
and seen a great deal of trouble; I think you might
let me go for little or nothing.’ He said, ‘I won't
do that; but if you will give me forty pounds bond
and good security, you may free.’ ”</p>
        <pb id="color136" n="136"/>
        <p>After much conversation between them on the
subject of his right to freedom, he continues: “Finally,
he sold my time for eighty dollars, and I went to
work, and worked it out in a shorter time than he
gave me, and then I was a free man. And when I
came to think that the <hi rend="italics">yoke was of my neck</hi>, and
<hi rend="italics">how</hi> it was <hi rend="italics">taken</hi> off, I was made to wonder and
admire, and to adore the order of kind Providence,
which assisted me in all my way.”</p>
        <p>Here he very feelingly recites the trials and
exercises of mind that attended him for not adhering to
that wisdom and goodness of his Creator, which had
been so <sic corr="marvelously">marvellously</sic> manifested for his deliverance,
and then proceeds to relate the circumstances respecting
his wife and children. “My wife was born a
slave, and remained one until she was thirty-two
years of age; when her master, falling out with her,
proposed sending her, with my eldest daughter, about
three months old, into the back country.</p>
        <p>“To go with her, I knew not where, or to buy her
at his price, brought me to a stand; but, by the
pleading of his wife and little daughter, he agreed to
let me have her for one hundred and thirty-three dollars
and a third, which is thirty-one pounds Virginia
money. I paid what money I had saved since paying
for my own freedom, and the rest as I earned it, and
she was manumitted. But I had one child in bondage,
my only son, and having worked through the
purchase of myself and wife, I thought I would give
up my son to the ordering of Divine Providence.</p>
        <pb n="137"/>
        <p>“So we worked and rented land, and got along
twelve or thirteen years, when my son's master died,
and his property had to be sold, and my son among
the rest, at public sale. The backwoods-men having
come over and given such large prices for slaves, it
occasioned a great concern to come over my mind,
and I told it to many of my friends, and they all
encouraged me to buy him, but I told them I could
have no heart to do it, because at his master's death
he was appraised at four hundred dollars; however, I
went to the sale. When, the crier said, ‘A likely
young negro-fellow for sale,’ and then asked for a bid,
I said, ‘Two hundred dollars.’</p>
        <p>“As soon as I made this bid, a man that I feared
would sell him to the back woods-men, bid three
hundred and thirty-three dollars, which beat down all
my courage, but a thought struck me—Don't give
out so—and I bid one shilling, but they continued
to bid until they got him up to three hundred and
sixty dollars, and I thought I could do no more;
but those men who had engaged to be my securities,
encouraged me, and some young men who were
present, and had their hearts touched with a feeling for
my distress, said, ‘Solomon, if you will make one
more bid, we will give you five dollars apiece;’ so
I turned round and said, ‘One shilling;’ so he was
knocked off to me at three hundred and sixty dollars
and a shilling: this was in the year 1813.</p>
        <p>“Then I believed that God would work, and none
could hinder Him, and that a way would be made
<pb id="color138" n="138"/>
for me, though I knew not how; and I confess the
eyes of my mind appeared to be dazzled as I was
let into a sight of the great goodness of the Highest
in undertaking for me; but I felt a fear lest my
behavior should not be suitable to the kindness and
favor shown toward me.</p>
        <p>“Oh, that all men would study the end of their
creation, and act accordingly! Then they would walk
in the light of His countenance indeed, and ‘in His
name rejoice all the day, and in His righteousness
for ever be exalted.’
<q direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>‘Then should their sun in smiles decline,</l><l>And bring a peaceful night;’</l></lg></q>
which may all who read these lines, desire, and seek,
and obtain, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.”</p>
        <p>In the account of his mother, he says, “She was
born of a woman brought from Guinea about the year
1690, then about eleven years old. She was brought
into one of the most barbarous families; and though
treated hard, she had many children, and lived to a
great age. My mother had thirteen sons and daughters,
and served the same cruel family until they died.</p>
        <p>“Then great distress and dispersion took place.
Our young mistress married, and brought our family
out of the State of Virginia into the State of Delaware,
but by their removing back to Virginia, we
were entitled to our freedom, and attempting to
recover it by law, we were sold and scattered wide.

My father and two of his children were taken
unaware, and sent to the West Indies. My mother was
in the house at the time, but made her escape, leaving
a child about eleven months old, which some kind
friend carrying to her, she took, and travelling
through Delaware, went into New Jersey.</p>
        <p>“We were separated about eighteen years, except
that I once visited her, and carried her seventeen or
eighteen dollars, which, in my circumstances, was a
sacrifice, but I was favored to find that satisfaction
which I esteemed more than time or money. Being
thoughtful about my mother, I sent for her to come
to the State of Delaware, and when we were brought
together, it was very comfortable, and we could sit
and tell of the dangers and difficulties we had been
brought through. She lived to a great age, and
departed without much complaint, like one falling
asleep.</p>

          <head>“<hi rend="italics">An account of my eldest daughter Margaret, who
died in the twenty-fourth year of her age</hi>.</head>
          <p>“She was a pleasant child in her manners and
behavior, yet fond of gay dress and new fashions; yet
her mind was much inclined to her book, and to read
good lessons; and it pleased the Father of mercy to
open her understanding to see excellent things out of
His law, and to convince her that it was His will she
should be holy here, and happy hereafter; but
custom, habit, and shame, seemed to chain her down, so
<pb id="color140" n="140"/>
that she appeared like one halting between two
opinions.</p>
          <p>“But about a month before she was taken for
death, she went to a Meeting, under a concern about
her future state; and the Meeting appeared to be
favored with the outpouring of the Spirit of love and
of power. Margaret came home under great concern
of mind, and manifested a wonderful change in her
manners and behavior; I believe the whole family
were affected at the sight of the alteration, which
indeed appeared like that of the prodigal son coming
home to his father. For my own part, I felt fear
and great joy—such was her delight to read the Bible
and ask the meaning of certain texts of Scripture, which
evidenced a concern to make sure work for eternity.</p>
          <p>“In this frame of mind she was taken for death.
She appeared very desirous to live, for the first four
weeks; but was very patient, and of a sweet temper
and disposition all the time. I recollect but one
instance when she was known to give way to peevish
fretfulness; then I, feeling the evil spirit striving to
get the advantage of her, very tenderly and earnestly
admonished her not to regard trifles, but to look to
that Power which was able to save her; and from
that time she became passive and resigned.</p>
          <p>“The following two weeks her pain was great, and
baffled all the force of medicine. A few days before
her departure, she was urged with much brokenness
of heart to make confession, when she was let into a
view of the vanity of the world, with all its glittering
<pb id="color141" n="141"/>
snares, and said she could not rest till her hair
was cut off; for, she said, ‘I was persuaded to plait
my hair against my father's advice, and I used to tie
up my head when father would come to see me, and
hide ruffles and gay dress from him, and now I
cannot rest till my hair is cut off.’ I said, ‘No, my
daughter, let it be till thee gets well.’ She answered,
‘Oh, no, cut it now.’ So I, to pacify her, took and
cropped it.</p>
          <p>“After this, she appeared filled with raptures of
joy, and talked of going, as if death had lost its sting.
This was about three days before her departure; and
she seemed to have her senses as long as she could
speak. A little before her speech left her, she called
us all, one by one, held out her hand, bade us
farewell, and looked as if she felt that assurance and
peace that destroy the fear of death; and while she
held out her hands, she earnestly charged us to meet
her in heaven.</p>
          <p>“I desire now to give the pious a brief account of
the life and death of my youngest daughter, Leah
Bayley, who departed this life the 27th of 7th month,
1821, aged twenty-one years and six months. She,
from a child, was more weakly and sickly than her
sister Margaret, and the thought of leaving her here
in this ill-natured world, caused me many serious
moments; but the great Parent of all good, in the
greatness of His care, took her away, and relieved me
of the care of her forever.</p>
          <p>“Weakness of body and mind appeared in her as
<pb id="color142" n="142"/>
she grew up, and an inclination to vanity and
idleness; but being bound out under an industrious
mistress, to learn to work and to have schooling, her
mind soon became much inclined to her book and
then to business. Her school-mistress gave her a
little book concerning some pious young people that
lived happily, and died happily, and were gone to
heaven; namely,— </p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“Young Samuel, that little child</l>
            <l>Who served the Lord, lived undefiled.</l>
            <l>Like young Abijah I must be,</l>
            <l>That good things may be found in me.</l>
            <l>Young Timothy, that blessed youth</l>
            <l>Who sought the Lord and loved the truth.</l>
            <l>I must not sin as others do,</l>
            <l>Lest I lie down in sorrow too.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>“These blessed examples won her heart so as to
bury every other enjoyment; she seemed to possess as
great a deadness to the world as any young woman I
ever observed. She seemed not ashamed to read in any
company, white or colored; and she read to the sick
with intense desire, which appeared from her weeping
and solid manner of behavior. She seemed to desire
to walk in the fear of the Lord all the day long; and
every body that observed her remarked her serious,
steady behavior.</p>
          <p>“She seemed as if she was trying to imitate those
good children whom she read about; and so continued
until she was taken sick; and though her sickness
was long and sharp, yet she bore it like a lamb. A
<pb id="color143" n="143"/>
few days before her decease, I was noticing how hard
she drew her breath; she looked very wistful at me,
and said, ‘Oh, father! how much I do suffer!’ I
answered, ‘Yes, my dear, I believe thee does.’</p>
          <p>“Then, after a long pause, she said, ‘But I think
I never shall say I suffer too much.’ This, I
apprehended, was extorted from a view of the sufferings of
Christ and her own imperfections. The day she died,
she called us all, one by one, and, like her sister
Margaret, held out her hand, and with much composure
of mind bade us farewell, as if she was only going a
short walk, and to return.”</p>

        <div2>
          <p>The last accounts from Solomon Bayley say, that
he was very diligent and faithful in his calling—
laboring not only for the souls of his brethren, but
for their bodies also—by setting them the best
example he was capable of, in cultivating his land to
the best advantage, and by improving his plans, to
show the natives, as well as the emigrants, the
usefulness and comforts of civilized life.</p>

        <head>CLARINDA,
<lb/>
A PIOUS COLORED WOMAN OF SOUTH CAROLINA, WHO<lb/>
DIED AT THE AGE OF A HUNDRED AND TWO YEARS.</head>
        <p>THE subject of this memoir was brought up in a
state of ignorance unworthy of a Christian country;
and following the propensities of a corrupt heart, she
<pb id="color144" n="144"/>
was, by her own confession, “sold under sin,” and
involved in almost every species of iniquity. And for
the furtherance of her wicked designs, she learned to
play on the violin, and usually, on the first day of the
week, sallied forth with her instrument, in order to
draw persons of both sexes together, who, not having,
the fear of God before their eyes, delighted like herself,
in sinful and pernicious amusements, which keep
the soul from God and the heart from repentance.</p>
        <p>But even on these occasions she found it difficult to
struggle against the Spirit of the Most High. Often was
it sounded in her conscience, “Clarinda, God ought
not to be slighted—God ought not to be forgotten;”
but these monitions were treated with derision, and
in the hardness of her heart she would exclaim: “Go,
you fool, I do not know God—go, I do not wish to
know Him.”</p>
        <p>On one occasion, while on her way to a dance, these
blasphemous thoughts, in answer to the monitions of
conscience, were passing through her mind, and in
this frame she reached the place of appointment, and
mingled in the gay throng. While participating in
the dance, she was seized with fits, and convulsively
fell to the ground. From that moment, she lost her
love of dancing, and no more engaged in this vain
amusement.</p>
        <p>She did not, however, forsake the evil of her ways,
but continued her course of wickedness. Thus she
went on for about twenty years, when she lost her
only child, and was confined for several months by
<pb id="color145" n="145"/>
severe illness. During this period of bodily suffering,
her mind was brought under awful convictions for sin:
she perceived that the great Jehovah is a sin-hating
and sin-avenging God, and that He will by no means
clear the guilty.</p>
        <p>She remained in a distressed state of mind for about
three months, and when a little bodily strength was
restored, she sought solitary places, where she poured
out her soul unto the Lord, and in His own good time
He spoke peace to her wounded spirit. One day being
thus engaged in earnest prayer, and looking unto the
Lord for deliverance, the evening approached
unregarded, her soul was deeply humbled, and the night
passed in prayer, while rivers of tears (to use her own
expressive language) ran down her cheeks, and she
ceased not to implore mercy from Him who is able to
bind up the broken-hearted.</p>
        <p>While thus engaged, and all this time ignorant of
her Saviour, something whispered to her mind, “Ask
in the name of Christ.” She queried, “Who is
Christ?” and in reply, these passages of Scripture
seemed repeated to her: “Let not your heart be
troubled; ye believe in God, believe also in Me.” “In
My Father's house are many mansions: I go to
prepare a place for you, that where I am there ye may be
also.” “I am the way, the truth, and the life; no
man cometh unto the Father but by Me.”</p>
        <p>Being desirous to know whence these impressions
proceeded, she was led to believe that they were
received through the influence of the Holy Spirit. This
<pb id="color146" n="146"/>
remarkable passage was also presented to her mind:
“Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace
with God through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.”</p>
        <p>She now felt the love of God shed abroad in her
heart; the overwhelming, burden of sin was removed,
and she received ability to sing praises to the Lord on
the banks of deliverance.</p>
        <p>Having been thus permitted to see the desire of her
soul, she was anxious to learn more of the divine will,
and inquired, like the apostle, “Lord, what wilt Thou
have me to do?” and like him she was commanded to
be a witness of what she had seen and heard. Believing
she had a commission given her to preach the
Gospel, she began to warn the sinful and licentious,
that they must crucify the man of sin, or for ever
forego the hope of salvation.</p>
        <p>This raised her a host of enemies, both white and
colored; and she underwent, many years, cruelty and
persecution which could hardly obtain credence. She
bore about on her body the visible marks of her faithful
allegiance to the Lord Jesus; yet, while alluding
to this, tears filled her eyes, and she said with emotion,
“I am thankful that I have been found worthy to suffer
for my blessed Saviour.”</p>
        <p>Although living in great poverty, and subsisting at
times on casual charity, with health impaired by the
sufferings through which she had passed, yet neither
promises of protection, accompanied with the offer of
the good things of this life, on the one hand, nor the
dreadful persecution she endured on the other, could
<pb id="color147" n="147"/>
make her relinquish the office of a minister of the
Gospel.</p>
        <p>This office she continued to exercise, holding meetings
regularly on the first day of the week, at her own
little habitation, where a greater number at times
assembled than could be accommodated in the house. It
may be interesting to add some particulars relative to
the trial of her faith and the persecution she suffered.</p>
        <p>One individual in whose neighborhood she lived,
who was much annoyed by hearing her sing and pray,
offered, if she would desist, to provide her with a home
and the comforts of life; but she replied, she had
received a commission to preach the Gospel, and she
would preach it as long as she had breath. Several
ill-intentioned persons one night surrounded her house,
and commanded her to come out to them. This she
refused to do. After threatening her for some time,
they forced open the door, and having seized their
victim, they beat her cruelly, so that her head was
deeply indented with the blows she received.</p>
        <p>At another time she was so much injured that she
was left nearly lifeless on the open road, whither she
had fled to escape from them; but her unsuccessful
efforts increased the rage of her pursuers, and after
treating her with the utmost barbarity, they left her.
She was found after some time, but so exhausted by
the loss of blood that she was unable to walk, and
from the effects of that cruelty she did not recover for
years. But it may be said of her, that she joyfully
bore persecution for Christ's sake.</p>
        <pb id="color148" n="148"/>
        <p>A man who lived in the same village, being much
incensed at the undaunted manner in which she stood
forth as a minister of the meek and crucified Saviour,
swore that he would beat her severely if ever he
found an opportunity. One evening, as she was
walking home on a solitary road, she saw this person
riding towards her. She knew his intentions, and
from his character she did not doubt that he would
execute them.</p>
        <p>She trembled from head to foot, escape seemed
impracticable, and prayer was her only refuge. As
he advanced, she observed that his handkerchief fell
and was wafted by the wind to a little distance. She
picked it up, he stopped his horse, and she handed
it to him in a submissive manner; he looked at her
fiercely for a moment, when his countenance softened;
he took it, saying, “Well, Clarinda,” and passed
on.</p>
        <p>She was not able to read a word till her sixty-sixth
year, but she was in the practice of getting persons to
read the Holy Scriptures to her, much of which she
retained in her memory with remarkable accuracy.
By dint of application, she was at length able to read
them herself; and those who visited her in advanced
life, found her knowledge of the Scriptures, as well as
her growth in grace, very surprising.</p>
        <p>When she was one hundred years old, and very
feeble, she would, if able to get out of bed, on the
Sabbath morning, discharge what she thought to be
her duty, by conversing with and exhorting both the
<pb id="color149" n="149"/>
white and colored people who came to her house,
often standing for half an hour at a time. Her zeal
was indeed great, and her faith steadfast.</p>
        <p>She said she often wished she could write, that she
might in this way also express her anxiety for the
good of souls. Then she would have described more
of the exercises of her mind upon the depravity of
man by nature and by practice, with the unbounded
and redeeming love and mercy of God through Jesus
Christ.</p>
        <p>The person who gives the account of Clarinda's
death, says, “I was prevented from seeing her often in
her last months; when I did see her she was always
the same—her one theme the love of God to poor
sinners, which was always her style of speaking. One
day, as I sat by her bedside, she said to me, ‘Do you
think I am a Christian?’ ‘Yes,’ I answered, ‘I do
believe you are a Christian.’ ‘I have tried to be,’ she
replied, ‘but now that I suffer in my body, when I
think what an unprofitable servant I have been, I am
distressed.’ She then wept. ‘You know,’ I said,
‘it is not how <hi rend="italics">much</hi> we can do, but what we do
<hi rend="italics">sincerely</hi> for the love of Christ, that is acceptable.’ She
seemed comforted, and talked as usual.</p>
        <p>“She showed me much affection when I left her,
saying ‘I shall not live long, my dear—,’ and,
adding a few other words, blessed me, and bid me
pray for her. She had frequently expressed her fears
of the bodily sufferings of death, but not accompanied
with a dread of eternal death. I asked her, when she
<pb id="color150" n="150"/>
was ill, if she <hi rend="italics">now</hi> feared to die. She said ‘No; this
fear was taken away some time previous to my
illness.’ ”</p>
        <p>She requested that her people, as she called them,
might continue to meet at her house, but this was
not allowed. I am told they sometimes meet elsewhere,
and are called “Clarinda's People.” When
dying, she told those near her to follow her <hi rend="italics">only</hi> as
she had followed Christ. Her death occurred in 1832.
“Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall
flourish in the courts of our God. They shall bring
forth fruit in old age.”</p>
        <p>While perusing this remarkable account of “a
brand plucked from the burning,” let those who from
their earliest years have enjoyed the inestimable
privilege of access to the sacred volume, and various
other religious means, seriously consider the blessed
Saviour's words: “Unto whomsoever much is given,
of him shall be much required.”</p>

        <head>NAIMBANNA.</head>
        <p>WHEN the Sierra Leone Company was first settled,
they endeavored to bring over to their friendship all
the petty African princes in their neighborhood.
Among others, they applied to a chief of the name of
Naimbanna, who was remarkable for a good disposition
and an acute understanding. He easily saw
<pb id="color151" n="151"/>
that the intention of the company was friendly to
Africa, and entered into amity with them.</p>
        <p>They spoke to him about the slave trade, and gave
him reasons for wishing to have it abolished. He
was convinced of its wickedness, and declared that
not one of his subjects should ever go into slavery
again. By degrees, they began to talk to him about
religion, but he was rather wary on that head. It
seems he had formed some prejudices against Christianity.</p>
        <p>Finding, however, that the Company's factory
contained a very good sort of people, and that they lived
happily among themselves, he began to think more
favorably of their religion; but he was still backward
either in receiving it himself, or in making it the
religion of his country. He was well convinced of
the barbarous state of his own people, on a comparison
with Europeans, and he wished for nothing more
than a reformation among them, especially in
religion.</p>
        <p>But as he found there were several kinds (or forms)
of religion in the world, he wished to know which
was the best before he introduced either of them. To
ascertain this point as well as he could, he took the
following method: He sent one of his sons into
Turkey, among the Mohammedans; a second into
Portugal, among the Papists; and the third he
recommended to the Sierra Leone Company, desiring they
would send him to England, to be there instructed in
the religion of that country.</p>
        <pb id="color152" n="152"/>
        <p>It appears he meant to be directed by the reports
of his sons in the choice of a national religion. Of
the two former of these young men, we have no
particulars, only that one of them became very vicious.
The last mentioned, though I believe the eldest, bore
his father's name, Naimbanna. The Sierra Leone
Company received the charge of him with great
pleasure, believing that nothing could have a better
effect in promoting their benevolent schemes, than
making him a good Christian.</p>
        <p>Young Naimbanna was a perfect African in form,
and had the features with which the African face is
commonly marked. While he was with the Company,
he seemed a well-disposed tractable youth; but
when opposed, he was impatient, fierce, and subject
to violent passion. In the first ship that sailed he
was sent to England, where he arrived in the year
1791.</p>
        <p>We may imagine with what astonishment he
surveyed every object that came before him: but his
curiosity, in prudent hands, became, from the first
the medium of useful instruction. During his voyage
he acquired some knowledge of the English language;
and although he could not speak it with any degree
of fluency, he could understand much of what he
heard spoken, which greatly facilitated his learning it,
when he applied to it in a more regular way.</p>
        <p>The difficulty of learning to speak and read being in
a great degree subdued, he was put upon the grand
point for which he was sent to England—that of being
<pb id="color153" n="153"/>
instructed in the Christian religion. The gentlemen
to whose care he had been recommended, alternately
took him under their protection; and each gave up
his whole time to him, faithfully discharging the
trust which he had voluntarily, and without any
emolument, undertaken.</p>
        <p>Naimbanna was first made acquainted with the
value of the Bible; the most material parts of the
Old Testament, as well as the New, were explained to
him. The great necessity of a Saviour, for the sinfulness
of man, was pointed out; the end and design of
Christianity, it's doctrines, its precepts, and its
sanctions, were all made intelligible to him. With a
clearness of understanding which astonished those
who took the care of instructing him, he made those
divine truths familiar to his mind. He received the
Gospel with joy, and carried it home to his heart as
the means of happiness both in this world and the
next.</p>
        <p>His love for reading the Scriptures, and hearing
them read, was such that he never was tired of the
exercise. Every other part of learning that he was
put upon, as arithmetic, for instance, was heavy work
with him, and he soon began to complain of fatigue;
but even when he was most fatigued, if he was asked
to read in the Bible, he was always ready, and generally
expressed his readiness by some emotions of joy.</p>
        <p>In short, he considered the Bible as the rule which
was to direct his life; and he made a real use of every
piece of instruction which he obtained from it. This
<pb id="color154" n="154"/>
was evident in all his actions. If his behavior was
at any time wrong, and a passage of Scripture was
shown to him, which forbade such behavior, whatever
it was, he instantly complied with the rule he received.
Of this there were many instances.</p>
        <p>One related to dress. He had a little vanity about
him, was fond of finery, admired it in other people,
and was always ready to adorn himself. His kind
instructors told him these were childish inclinations;
that decency and propriety of dress are pleasing, but
that foppery is disgusting. Above all, they told him
that the Christian is ordered to be “clothed with
humility, and to put on the ornament of a meek and
quiet spirit.” Such passages, whenever they were
suggested to him, checked all the little vanities of his
heart, and made him ashamed of what he had just
before so eagerly desired.</p>
        <p>The irritable passions, where lay his weakest side,
were conquered in the same way. His friends once
carried him to the House of Commons, to hear a
debate on the slave trade, which Colonel Tarlton
defended with some warmth. When Naimbanna came
out of the house, he exclaimed, with great vehemence
and indignation, that he would kill that man wherever
he met him; for he told stories of his country.
He told people that his countrymen would not work,
and that was a great story. His countrymen would
work; but Englishmen would not buy work; they
would buy only men.</p>
        <p>His friends told him that he should not be angry
<pb id="color155" n="155"/>
with Colonel Tarlton, for perhaps he had been
misinformed, and knew no better. Besides, they told him
that, at any rate, he had no right to kill him: for the
Almighty says, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay,
saith the Lord.” This calmed him in a moment;
and he never afterward expressed the least indignation
toward Colonel Tarlton; but he would have
been ready to show him any friendly office if it had
fallen in his way.</p>
        <p>At another time, when he saw a drayman using his
horse ill, he became enraged, and declared he would
get a gun and shoot that fellow directly. But his
anger was presently assuaged by this or some similar
passage of Scripture: “Be ye angry, and sin not; let
not the sun go down upon your wrath.” He showed
so much tenderness of conscience that he seemed
anxious about nothing but to know what his religion
required him to do.</p>
        <p>When he could determine the rectitude of an action,
he set an example even to Christians, by showing that
he thought there was no difficulty in the performance.
He said his father had ordered him, when he arrived
in England, never to drink more at one time than a
single glass of wine; and he considered his father's
injunction as sacred. On this head, therefore, all the
instruction which he wanted was to turn his temperance
into a Christian virtue, by practising it with a
sincere desire to please God.</p>
        <p>In the gay scenes which often presented themselves
to his view, he never mixed. His friends were very
<pb id="color156" n="156"/>
solicitous to keep him from all dissipation, which
might have corrupted the beautiful simplicity of mind
that was so characteristic in him. He was fond of
riding on horseback, but when he got upon a horse, it
was difficult to govern his desire for rapid motion.
After remaining in England a year and a half, and
being carefully instructed in the Christian religion, he
only waited for an opportunity of returning home,
which did not occur for five or six months afterward.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, two great points were the burden
of his thoughts, and gave him much distress. The
first related to his father, whose death he heard had
happened about a year after he left the country. The
principal cause of his solicitude was his uncertainty
whether his father had died a Christian. He knew
that he had been well disposed toward Christianity,
but he had never heard whether he had fully
embraced it.</p>
        <p>His other difficulty regarded himself. He had now
attained the end at which he had aimed. He had
been instructed in a religion which he was convinced
would promote the happiness of his people if it could
be established among them. But how was that to be
done? With regard to himself, he had had wise and
learned men to instruct him. But what could his
abilities do in such a work—especially considering
the wild and savage manners of his countrymen? In
every light, the greatness of the attempt perplexed
him.</p>
        <pb id="color157" n="157"/>
        <p>With a mind distressed by these difficulties, he
took an affectionate leave of his kind friends in
England, and embarked for Africa in one of the
Company's ships, which was named after him, the
Naimbanna. Though he had shown great affection for his
own country and relations, yet the kindness which he
had received from his friends in England had
impressed him strongly; and it was not without a great
struggle that he broke away from them at last.</p>
        <p>The distress he felt was increased by the society he
mixed in at sea—being very different from that which
he had left behind. The profligate manners and
licentious language of the ship's company shocked
him exceedingly. The purity of his mind could not
bear it. He had hoped, that in a Christian country
he should always find himself among Christians, but
he was greatly disappointed.</p>
        <p>The company he was in appeared to him as ignorant
and uninformed as his own countrymen, and
much less innocent in their manners. At length, the
oaths and abominable conversation which he continually
heard, affected him so much that he complained
to the captain of the ship, and desired him to put a
stop to so indecent language. The captain endeavored
to check it, but with little effect, which gave Naimbanna
increased distress.</p>
        <p>But still the great burden of his mind, was the
difficulty which he foresaw in the attempt to introduce
Christianity among his countrymen. Many were
the schemes he thought of; but insuperable obstacles
<pb id="color158" n="158"/>
seemed to arise on every side. All this perplexity,
which his active and generous mind underwent,
recoiled upon himself.</p>
        <p>His thoughts were continually on the stretch, and
this, it was supposed, at length occasioned a fever,
which seized him when his voyage was nearly at an
end. His malady increasing, it was attended with
delirium, which left him only a few lucid intervals.
In these, his mind always shone out full of religious
hope and patient resignation to the will of God.</p>
        <p>In one of these intervals, he told Mr. Graham, a
fellow-passenger with whom he was most intimate,
that he began to think he should be called away
before he had an opportunity to tell his mother of the
mercies of God toward him, and of his obligations to
the Sierra Leone Company. He then desired him to
write his will, which he began in the presence of
Captain Wooles and James Cato, a servant that
attended Naimbanna.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Graham had written a considerable part,
as particularly directed, manifesting the feelings and
generosity of his heart, Naimbanna complained of
fatigue, and said he would finish it after he had taken
a little rest. But his fever came on with increased
violence, and his delirium scarcely ever left him
afterward.</p>
        <p>The night after, the vessel, though close to the
African coast, durst not attempt to land, as the wind
was contrary, and there was danger of running on the
Scarries bank. Next morning, though the wind
<pb id="color159" n="159"/>
continued contrary, Mr. Graham went off to the
settlement in an open boat to procure medical aid. But
when the physician came on board, Naimbanna was
just alive; and in that state he was carried to the
settlement, the next morning, July 17th, 1793, when
the ship came to anchor.</p>
        <p>On the first account of his illness, an express was
sent to inform his friends at Robanna; and soon after
he was landed, his mother, brothers, sisters, and
relatives came to the settlement. The distracted looks
of his mother, and the wildness of his sisters' grief,
affected everyone. His cousin Henry, an ingenuous
youth, who stood among them, attracted the attention
of all by the solemn sorrow of his countenance, which
seemed to discover a heart full of tenderness and woe.
In the meantime, the dying youth appeared every
moment drawing nearer the close of life.</p>
        <p>His voice failing more and more, the little he said
was with difficulty understood. Once or twice, those
who stood around him caught hold of something like
our Saviour's words: “Many are called, but few
chosen.” About an hour before he died, his voice
wholly failed. He was awhile restless and uneasy,
till, turning his head on his pillow, he found an easier
posture, and lay perfectly quiet.</p>
        <p>About seven in the evening of the day on which he
was brought on shore, he expired without a groan.
When his mother and other relatives found his
breath was gone, their shrieks and agonizing cries
were distressing beyond measure. Instantly, in a
<pb id="color160" n="160"/>
kind of frantic madness, they snatched up his body,
hurried it into a canoe, and went off with it to
Robanna. Some of the gentlemen of the factory
immediately followed in boats, with a coffin.</p>
        <p>When the corpse was laid decently into it, Mr.
Horne, the clergyman, read the funeral service over
it, amid a number of people, and finished with an
extempore prayer. The ceremony was conducted with
so much solemnity, and performed in so affecting
a manner, that the impression was communicated
throughout the whole crowd. They drew closer and
closer, as Mr. Horne continued to speak; and though
they understood not a syllable of what he said, they
listened to him with great attention, and bore
witness, with every mark of sorrow, to the powers of
sympathy.</p>
        <p>After the ceremony was over, the gentlemen of the
factory retired to their boats, leaving the corpse, as
his friend desired, to be buried according to the
custom of the country.</p>

        <head>ZILPAH MONTJOY.</head>
        <p>IN the year 1821, died, in the city of New York,
an aged woman of color, named Zilpah Montjoy;
whose pious circumspect life rendered her an object
of peculiar interest to many of her acquaintances; to
some of these, whose friendly notice she had
<pb id="color161" n="161"/>
experienced, she more than once related the following
circumstance:—</p>
        <p>Being a slave, inured to hard labor, she was
brought up in such extreme ignorance as to have no
idea that she was an accountable being—that there
was a future state—not even that death was universal,
until the sixteenth year of her age, when a girl of
her own color dying in the neighborhood, she was
permitted to attend the funeral.</p>
        <p>The minister's text was, “Man that is born of a
woman is of few days and full of trouble: he cometh
forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as
a shadow, and continueth not!” by which and
subsequent remarks, she understood that all were to die;
that there was a state of existence after death, a
preparation for which was necessary while here.</p>
        <p>She was much affected, and returned home in great
agitation. Revolving these things in her mind for
several days, she at length asked her mistress whether
she had understood right, that all must die. The
reply was, “Go to your work.” She continued thus
exercised for a considerable time, earnestly desiring
to know what she had to do, but had no one to give
her instruction.</p>
        <p>In this tried state, the Lord was pleased to reveal
Himself, and impress on her untaught mind a belief
in an omnipotent and omniscient Being, and that His
law was written on the heart. Thus, gradually
becoming calm and settled, her confidence was made
strong in Him, who, hiding His counsels from the wise
<pb id="color162" n="162"/>
and prudent in their own eyes, “hath revealed them
unto babes.” And it is believed she was from that
time guarded and careful in her conduct.</p>
        <p>She married, and had two daughters, one of whom
was taken at an early age, and placed at so great a
distance from her that she never saw her after. The
other died when about grown, and being also
bereaved of her husband, she was very lonely. But
under these trials she appears to have been sustained, as
was David when he could say, “Thy rod and thy
staff they comfort me.”</p>
        <p>She was a member of the Methodist Church, and a
diligent attender of their meetings as long as her
strength permitted. When she was (as near as can
be ascertained) about sixty-eight years old, the Clark-
son Association for teaching colored women to read
and write was established.</p>
        <p>And when she received the information, she offered
herself as a scholar, but the teachers endeavored to
dissuade her, telling her she was too old to begin, as
she did not know a letter, and her sight was so
impaired as to require two pairs of spectacles; she
however urged admittance, stating that her only motive
was a desire to be able to read the Bible, and she
believed “the Lord would help her,” adding, “We are
never too old to do good.”</p>
        <p>And being admitted, she was very diligent in her
attendance, and by great perseverance became able to
read a little in the New Testament; and one with
large print being given her, she prized it very highly,
<pb id="color163" n="163"/>
and would frequently open it and read one of the
chapters contained in Christ's sermon on the mount,
calling it “the blessed chapter.”</p>
        <p>But notwithstanding her great desire to learn, she
did not allow her studies to interfere with her religious
engagements; and the time for meeting with her class
being fixed on one of the afternoons that the school
was taught, it was inconvenient to her; but as the
school commenced at three o'clock, and the meeting
at four, the hour between she generally spent at the
school, staying as long as it would do, and then going
as quickly as she could, to be punctual to the time.
Sometimes she has been seen running, when she heard
the clock strike and found herself a little too late.</p>
        <p>She was industrious and frugal, but liberated late
in life, she barely procured a subsistence; and for the
last two or three years, being nearly past labor, she
was dependent on the benevolence of others: but at
no time, however destitute and tried, did she lose her
confidence in the power of Him “who provideth for
the raven his food,” often saying at such seasons,
“The Lord has been my helper, and I trust in Him.”
And when any favor was conferred on her, she
feelingly expressed her gratitude, yet mostly with
reference to the Great Supreme, for giving her friends so
kind.</p>
        <p>At a certain time, a friend, being unusually thoughtful
about her, went to see how she was situated, taking
with her a loaf of bread. She found her unable
to go out, and without provision; and querying with
<pb id="color164" n="164"/>
her, “Zilpah, art thou here alone?” she replied,
“No, I am never alone; my Master is with me. When
I awake in the night season he talks with me. He
has promised to take care of me, and He has done it;
He has now sent me that loaf of bread.” At another
time, she said to a person who visited her, “How good
the Lord is; I have always something to eat, for if I
take my last morsel, some one comes and brings me
more before I want again.”</p>
        <p>Her understanding failed, so that for several weeks
before her death she knew very little; but her
conversation was innocent, sometimes saying, “If it is
the Lord's will to take me, I am willing to go, but I
must wait His time.” And He was pleased to release
her, after a short confinement, without any apparent
disease but the decline of nature, about the
seventy-ninth year of her age.</p>

        <head>BELINDA LUCAS.</head>
        <p>A woman of color, living in Chrystie street, New
York, is now, 1825, about one hundred years old.
She retains her faculties remarkably well, and she
recently gave the following account of herself: “When
I was a small child in Africa, being one day at play
in the woods, some people came along; one of whom
catched me, and throwing me over his shoulder, ran
away with me. After he bad gone some distance, he
put me down and whipped me to make me run.</p>
        <p>“When we came to the water, they put me into the
<pb id="color165" n="165"/>
ship and carried me to Antigua. Soon after, the
captain of a vessel from New York, taking a liking to
me, bought me, and brought me here. I was then so
little, that I slept sometimes at my mistress's feet. I
think there was only one house for worship in the
city then; and I remember very well that up Broadway
there were only a few small houses; and where
the college (in Park Place) stands it was woods.</p>
        <p>“I was sold several times, married twice, and had
one child that died young. I was baptized in St.
Paul's church, not long after it was built; and when
I was about forty years old, I bought my freedom for
twenty pounds. Not long after I married my last
husband, I paid for his freedom, and we went to
Charleston. After living there about seven years, he
died; and knowing I had many friends and acquaintances
in New York, I came back.</p>
        <p>“I brought a hundred dollars with me, which I put
into the church stock. From that I have received
seven dollars every year, and with it I buy my winter
firewood. By working early and late, besides my
day's work, I earned money, and got a life lease of
this spot of ground, and built this house; and in this
room” (which is on the first floor) “I have lived
many years.</p>
        <p>“The upper part I rent; but sometimes the people
have been poor, and could not pay me; then I lost
it; but these people pay me very well. I have been
asked many times to sell it, but I think it is much
better for me to stay quietly here than to be moving
<pb id="color166" n="166"/>
about: and besides, I let Mr.—have fifty dollars,
and when he failed, I lost it; and the bad folks
have several times taken money out of my chest; and
I was afraid, if I did sell, I should lose that also, and
then I should be very bad off.</p>
        <p>“As I have no relation of my own, when I am
gone, and don't want these things any more, they are
to be divided among my husband's folks.” A person
present told her she should have a writing drawn, to
tell how they should be divided; saying, “Perhaps
they will quarrel about it.” She said, “I have told
them if they did, them that quarrelled must not have
anything.”</p>
        <p>When asked if she could read, she answered, “Yes;
when I was young I learned to spell a little, but I did
not know how to put the words together, till I went
to the Clarkson school. There I learned to read; and
though I can't read all the hard words in the Bible, I
can read Matthew and John very well.” A representation
of the crucifixion of Christ hanging over the
chimney-piece, she pointed to it, and explained it very
intelligibly, remarking that, “To Mary, who was
kneeling near the cross, it was said, ‘Woman, behold
thy Son,’ and to one of those standing by, ‘Behold
thy Mother.’ ”</p>
        <p>This representation appeared to afford her much
interest in contemplating it, though she looked only
to the Lord for consolation, and several times, while
giving this account, testified of His goodness and
mercy to her; saying, “It is the Lord's will that I
<pb id="color167" n="167"/>
should be so comfortably provided for. When I was
younger, and worked so steadily, the people used to
say, ‘Belinda, what do you work so hard for, and lay
up money? you have no children to take it when you
are gone.’</p>
        <p>“I did not know then, but the Lord knew that I
was to live a great while, and He put it into my heart
to do so, and now I have plenty, and trouble nobody
for a living. I am unwell this morning, but by and
by, when I feel better, I intend to clean up. I used
to live very snug and comfortable; I can't get anybody
now to put up my things for me so well as I can
do it for myself.” Her bed had curtains, and appeared
to have comfortable covering on it. She had a
looking-glass, an arm-chair, a carpet on her floor, and
other necessary furniture.</p>
        <p>She further said, “When I was able, I went often
to see the sick, and the suffering poor, and do
something for them, and I sometimes prayed by their
bedside;” and added, “I believe the Lord heard my
prayers.” Placing her hands in an attitude of
supplication, and turning her eyes upward, “I often pray
now, and I leave it to Him, and He gives me what I
pray for. If He thinks it best for me to live longer
yet, I am willing to stay; and if He thinks best to
take me away, I am ready to go.”</p>
        <p>On being asked how old she was, she replied,
“When Peter Williams was going to Hayti, and he
came to see me and bid me farewell, he said,
‘Belinda, I have been calculating your age, as near as I
<pb id="color168" n="168"/>
can from circumstances, and I believe you are about
a hundred years old.’ I thought I was older, but I
suppose he must be correct.</p>
        <p>“I used to work for the rich folks, and they seemed
to love me, and treated me very kindly. Mrs.
T—, and Mrs. H—, and many others, have
been to see me a great many times. Mr. Livingston,
the lawyer, who died at Washington, you remember
—with his first wife's father, Mr. Kittletas, I lived,
and of him I bought my freedom. And when I went
to Mr. Livingston's, he would say, ‘Why, Belinda,
you have a long life of it here.’ I would say, ‘Yes,
master, the Lord knows, but I don't, why I stay so
long'—but, dear man, he is gone!”</p>
        <p>On being asked why she lived alone, she said, “If
I have somebody with me, they will want other
company, and that will make more noise than I like. I
love to be still; then I can think. And when I am
sick, the people up stairs are kind to me, and do what
little I want done.”</p>
        <p>When speaking of reading, she said, I met with a
bad accident lately; I dropped my spectacles in the
fire, and it spoiled them: when I can get into the
Bowery, to Mr.—'s store, I can get another
pair; but nobody can get them for me—they would
not know how to suit my eyes—and then I always
pay cash for what I get—I have found it the best
way. In all my life long, there has never anybody
had the scratch of a pen against me. I have been
saving too: them plates there” (pointing to her
<pb id="color169" n="169"/>
closet), “I brought them with me from Charleston
before Washington's war.”</p>
        <p>In this unpolished narrative, we see the benefit of
acquiring steady habits in early life—of honest,
persevering industry—and frugality in the use of what
was so obtained. From the one hundred dollars put
into church stock, she has in fifty years received
three hundred and fifty dollars; and in such a way as
to be particularly useful to her. Her pious care of
the sick; her quiet, decent, and comely way of
living; and her exertion in learning to read, even at
the advanced age of eighty years, are also worthy of
particular notice.</p>

        <head>GUSTAVUS VASSA.</head>
        <bibl>TAKEN FROM HIS NARRATIVE, WRITTEN ABOUT THE<lb/>
YEAR 1787.</bibl>
        <p>“I OFFER here neither the history of a saint, a
hero, nor a tyrant. I believe there are few events
in my life, which have not happened to many; but
when I compare my lot with that of many of my
countrymen, I acknowledge the mercies of Providence
in the occurrences that have taken place.</p>
        <p>“That part of Africa known by the name of
Guinea, to which the trade for slaves is carried on,
extends along the coast above 3,400 miles, from
Senegal to Angola, and includes a variety of kingdoms.
<pb id="color170" n="170"/>
The most considerable of these is Benin, as it respects
its extent, wealth, and richness of soil. It is bounded
on the sea 170 miles, and its interior seems only
terminated by the empire of Abyssinia, near 1,500 miles
from its first boundaries.</p>
        <p>“In one of the most remote and fertile provinces
of this kingdom I was born, in the year 1745. As
our country is one where nature is prodigal of her
favors, our wants, which are few, are easily supplied.
All our industry is turned to the improvement of
those blessings, and we are habituated to labor from
our early years; and by this means we have no
beggars.</p>
        <p>“Our houses never exceed one story, and are built
of wood, thatched with reeds, and the floors are
generally covered with mats. The dress of both sexes
consists of a long piece of calico or muslin, wrapped
loosely round the body; our beds are also covered
with the same kind of cloth; this the women make
when they are not engaged in labor with the men.
Our tillage is in a large common, and all the people
resort thither in a body and unite in the labor.</p>
        <p>“My father being a man of rank, had a numerous
family; his children consisted of one daughter, and
a number of sons, of which I was the youngest. As
I generally attended my mother, she took great pains
in forming my mind, and training me to exercise. In
this way, I grew up to about the eleventh year of my
age, when an end was put to my happiness in the
following manner:</p>
        <pb id="color171" n="171"/>
        <p>“One day, when all our people were gone to their
work, and only my dear sister and myself were left
to watch the house, two men and a woman came, and
seizing us both, stopped our mouths that we should
not make a noise, and ran off with us into the woods,
where they tied our hands, and took us some distance,
to a small house, where we stayed that night.</p>
        <p>“The next morning, after keeping in the woods
some distance, we came to an opening, where we saw
some people at work, and I began to cry for assistance;
but this made them tie us faster, and again
stop our mouths; and they put me into a sack until
we had got out of sight of these people. When they
offered us food we could not eat. Often bathing each
other in tears, our only respite was sleep; but alas!
even the privilege of weeping together was soon
denied us. While enclosed in each other's arms we
were torn asunder, and I was left in a state of distress
not to be described.</p>
        <p>“After travelling a great distance, suffering many
hardships, and being sold several times, one evening
my dear sister was brought to the same house. We
were both so overcome that we could not speak for
some time, but clung to each other and wept. And
when the people were told that we were brother and
sister, they indulged us with being together; and one
of the men at night lay between us, and allowed us
to hold each other's hand across him.</p>
        <p>“This comfort, small as it may appear to some, was
not so to us: but it was of short duration; when
<pb id="color172" n="172"/>
morning came, we were again separated, and I never
saw her more. I remember the happiness of our
childish sports, the indulgence of maternal affection;
and fear that her lot would be still harder than mine,
fixed her image so indelibly on my mind, that neither
prosperity nor adversity has ever erased it.</p>
        <p>“I once attempted to run away; but when I had
got into the woods, and night came on, I became
alarmed with the idea of being devoured by wild
beasts, and with trembling steps, and a sad heart, I
returned to my master's house, and laid down in his
fireplace, where I was found in the morning. Being
closely reprimanded by my master, he ordered me to
be taken care of, and I was soon sold again. I then
travelled through a very fertile country, where I saw
cocoa-nuts and sugar-cane.</p>
        <p>“All the people I had hitherto seen, resembled my
own; and having learned a little of several languages,
I could understand them pretty well; but now, after
six or seven months had passed away, from the time
I was kidnapped, I arrived at the sea-coast, and I
beheld that element which before I had no idea of.
It also made me acquainted with such cruelties as I
can never reflect upon but with horror. The first
object that met my sight was a <hi rend="italics">slave ship</hi> riding at
anchor, <hi rend="italics">waiting for her cargo!</hi></p>
        <p>“When I was taken on board, being roughly
handled and closely examined by these men, whose
complexion and language differed so much from any
I had seen or heard before, I apprehended I had got
<pb id="color173" n="173"/>
into a world of bad spirits, which so overcame me
that I fainted and fell. When I came to, their
horrible looks and red faces frightened me again
exceedingly. But I had not time to think much about it,
before I was, with many of my poor country people,
put under deck in a loathsome and horrible place. In
this situation we wished for death, and sometimes
refused to eat, and for this we were beaten.</p>
        <p>“After enduring more hardships than I can relate,
we arrived at Barbadoes, in the West Indies. When
taken on shore, we were put into a pen like so many
beasts, and thence sold and separated—husbands and
wives, parents and children, brothers and sisters,
without any distinction. Their cries excited some
compassion in the hearts of those who were capable
of feeling, but others seemed to feel no remorse,
though the scene was so affecting.</p>
        <p>“I, with some others, was sent to America: when
we arrived in Virginia, we were also sold and separated.
Not long after, Captain Pascal, coining to my
master's, purchased me, and sent me on board his
ship, called the Industrious Bee. I had not yet
learned much of the English language, so I could not
understand their conversation; and some of them
made me believe I was going home to Africa. This
pleased me very much, and the kind treatment I
received made me happy; but when we came in sight
of England, I found they had deceived me. It was
on board this ship I received the name of Gustavus
Vassa.</p>
        <pb id="color174" n="174"/>
        <p>“Having often seen my master, and a lad named
Richard Baker, who was very kind to me, reading in
books, I had a desire to do so, that I might find out
how all things had a beginning. For that purpose, I
often took a book, talked to it, and then placed it to
my ear to hear what it would say; but when I found
it remained silent, I was much concerned.</p>
        <p>“The summer of 1757, I was taken by a
press-gang, and carried on board a man-of-war. After
passing about a year in this service, on the coast of
France and in America, on my return to England, I
received much kindness, and was sent to school, where
I learned to read and write. My master receiving
the office of lieutenant on board one of those ships,
took me with him up the Mediterranean. My desire
for learning induced some of my shipmates to instruct
me, so that I could read the Bible; and one of them,
a sober man, explained many passages to me.</p>
        <p>“As I had now served my master faithfully
several years, and his kindness had given me hopes that
he would grant my freedom when we arrived in
England, I ventured to tell him so; but he was
offended, for he had determined on sending me to the
West Indies. Accordingly, at the close of the year
1762, finding a vessel bound thither, he took me on
board, and gave me in charge of the captain.</p>
        <p>“I endeavored to expostulate with him, by telling
him he had received my wages and all my prize
money, but it was to no purpose. Taking my only
coat from my back, he went off in his boat. I
<pb id="color175" n="175"/>
followed them with aching eyes, and a heart ready to
burst with grief, until they were out of sight. The
captain, whose name was Doran, treated me very
kindly, but we had a tempestuous voyage.</p>
        <p>“When we came in sight of Montserrat,
remembering what I had seen on my first arrival from
Africa, it chilled me to the heart, and brought nothing
to my view but misery, stripes, and chains: and
to complete my distress, two of the sailors robbed me
of about eight guineas, which I had collected by
doing little jobs on board the ships of war, and which
I hid when my master took my coat.</p>
        <p>“Having <sic corr="unloaded">unladed</sic> the ship, and laded her again
for sea, the captain sent for me: when, with trembling
steps and a faltering heart, I came to him. I
found him sitting with Robert King, a Quaker,
and a merchant: and after telling me the charge he
had to get me a good master, he said he had got me
one of the best on the island. Mr. King also said
he had bought me on account of my good character (to
maintain which I found to be of great importance), and
that his home was in Philadelphia, where he expected
soon to go, and he did not intend to treat me hard.</p>
        <p>“He asked me what I could do. I answered, I
can shave and dress hair pretty well; and that I have
learned to refine wines; I could write, and understood
arithmetic as far as the Rule of Three. The
character Captain Doran had given of my master, I
found to be correct. He possessed an amiable disposition,
and was very charitable and humane.</p>
        <pb id="color176" n="176"/>
        <p>“In passing about the island, I had an opportunity
of seeing the dreadful usage, and wretched situation
of the poor slaves, and it reconciled me to my
condition, and made me thankful for being placed
with so kind a master. He was several times
offered a great price for me, but he would not sell me.
Having obtained three pence, I began a little trade
and soon gained a dollar, then more; with this I
bought me a Bible.</p>
        <p>“Going in a vessel of my master's to Georgia and
Charleston, a small venture I took on my return
answered a very good purpose. In 1765, my master
prepared for going to Philadelphia. With his crediting
me for some articles, and the little stock of my
own, I laid in considerable, which elated me much;
and I told him I hoped I should soon obtain enough
to purchase my freedom, which he promised me I
should have when I could pay him what he gave for
me.</p>
        <p>“Between Montserrat and several ports in America
we made many trips. One circumstance occurred
when I was in Georgia that was a serious one to me.
Being in a yard with some slaves one evening, their
master coming home drunk, and seeing me, a stranger,
he, with a stout man to help him, beat me so that I
could not go aboard the ship, which gave the captain
much anxiety. When he found me, and saw the
situation I was in, he wept; but by his kind attention,
and that of a <sic corr="skillful">skilful</sic> physician, I was in a few weeks
able to go on board and attend to my business.</p>
        <pb id="color177" n="177"/>
        <p>“Thus, passing from one port to another, with my
kind master's and captain's indulgence, and my own
indefatigable industry and economy, I obtained the
sum required for my liberty. So, one morning, while
they were at breakfast, I ventured to remind my
master of what he had promised, and to tell him I
had got the money—at which he seemed surprised.
The captain told him I had come honestly by it, and
he must now fulfil his promise.</p>
        <p>“Upon which he told me to get a manumission
drawn, and he would sign it. At this intelligence
my heart leaped for joy. When the whole was
finished, and I was in reality free, I felt like another
being—my joy was indescribable. My master and
Captain Doran entreated me not to leave them, and
gratitude induced me to stay, though I longed to see
Captain Pascal, and let him know I was <hi rend="italics">free</hi>.</p>
        <p>“I now hired as a sailor, and our next voyage was
to Savannah. When we were preparing to return,
and were taking some cattle on board, one of them
butted the captain in the breast, which affected him
so that he was unable to do duty, and he died before
we reached our port. This was a heavy stroke to me,
for he had been my true friend, and I loved him as a
father.</p>
        <p>“The winter following, I sailed again for Georgia,
with a new captain, in the Nancy: but steering a
more westerly course than usual, we soon got on the
Bahama banks, where our vessel was wrecked, but no
lives were lost. Getting on one of the islands, with
<pb id="color178" n="178"/>
some salt provision we had saved, we remained there
many days, and suffered much for want of fresh
water.</p>
        <p>“When we were almost famished with hunger and
thirst, we were found and carried to New Providence,
where we were kindly treated. Thence we were taken
to Savannah, so to Martinico and Montserrat, having
been absent about six months, and experienced the
delivering hand of Providence more than once, when
all human means seemed hopeless.</p>
        <p>“After relating to Mr. King the loss of the Nancy,
and the various hardships we had endured, I again
told him my desire to go to England; and although
he wished me to remain in his service, he consented,
and gave me the following certificate:—‘The bearer
hereof, Gustavus Vassa, was my slave upward of
three years; during which time he always behaved
himself well, and discharged his duty with honesty
and assiduity.—R. KING.’</p>
        <p>“Obtaining this certificate, I soon parted with my
kind master, and arrived in England. When I here
received my wages, I had thirty-seven guineas. I
soon found my old captain, Pascal, who was surprised
to see me, and asked how I came back. I told him,
‘In a ship.’ To which he replied, ‘I suppose you
did not <hi rend="italics">walk</hi> on the <hi rend="italics">water</hi>.’</p>
        <p>“I now set my mind on getting more learning, and
attending school diligently. My money not being
sufficient, I hired myself to service a while; but
having a desire to go again to the Mediterranean, I
<pb id="color179" n="179"/>
engaged on board a ship, where the mate taught me
navigation. While at Smyrna, I saw many caravans
from India. Among other articles, they brought
great quantities of locusts, and a kind of pulse
resembling French beans, though larger; they are sweet
and palatable.</p>
        <p>“In the spring of 1773, an expedition was fitted
out to explore a northwest passage to India. Dr.
Irving concluding to go, I accompanied him, and we
went on board one of the vessels the 24th of May;
and about the middle of June, by the use of the
doctor's apparatus for making salt water fresh, we
distilled from twenty-six to forty gallons a day. On
the 28th we reached Greenland, where I found the
sun did not set.</p>
        <p>“We found large fields of ice, and to one of them,
about eighty yards thick, we made our vessel fast: but
we soon became so surrounded with ice that we could
not move, and were in danger of being crushed to
pieces. In this perilous situation we remained eleven
days, when the weather becoming more mild, and the
wind changing, the ice gave way, and in about thirty
hours, with hard labor, we got into open water, to
our great joy, and arrived at Deptford, after an
absence of four months, wherein we had experienced
imminent dangers.</p>
        <p>“Rejoicing to be again in England, I entered into
service, and remained a considerable time; during
which I began to reflect seriously on the many
dangers I had escaped, particularly in my last voyage,
<pb id="color180" n="180"/>
and it made a serious impression on my mind; and
my reflections were often turned to the awfulness of
eternity.</p>
        <p>“In this state, I took to my Bible, rejoicing that I
could read it for myself, and I received encouragement.
While my mind was thus seriously impressed,
I went several voyages to Spain, and being often led
to look over the occurrences of my past life, I saw
there had been the hand of Providence to guide and
protect me, though I knew it not; and when I
considered my obligations to the Lord for His goodness,
I wept.</p>
        <p>“On our return, the last voyage, we picked up
eleven Portuguese. Their vessel had sunk, with two
of the crew, and they were in a small open boat,
without victuals, compass, water, or anything else, and
must soon have perished. As soon as they got on
board our vessel, they fell on their knees and thanked
God for their deliverance. Thus I saw verified what
was written in the 107th Psalm.</p>
        <p>“From the year 1777 to 1784, I remained more
quiet; but about the latter period I made a trip to
New York, and one to Philadelphia. At the latter
place, I was very much pleased to see the worthy
Quakers easing the burdens of my oppressed countrymen.
It also rejoiced my heart when one of these
people took me to the free school, and I saw the
children of my color instructed, and their minds
cultivated to fit them for usefulness.</p>
        <p>“Not long after my return, I found government
<pb id="color181" n="181"/>
was preparing to make a settlement of free people of
color on the coast of Africa, and that vessels were
engaged to carry such as wished to go to Sierra
Leone. I engaged as commissary, and we set sail
with 426 persons. But the time of our arrival there,
the rainy season having commenced, proved unfavorable,
and some of us soon returned to England;
where, since that period, I have been doing what I could
for the relief of my much-injured country people.</p>
        <p>“Having been early taught to look for the hand of
God in minute circumstances, they have been of
consequence to me; and aiming at simple truth in relating
the incidents of my life, I hope some of my readers
will gather instruction from them.”</p>
        <p>Gregorie, in his Inquiry into the Intellectual and
Moral Faculties of the Negroes, states, that after
thirty years of a wandering and stormy life, Vassa
established himself in London, where he married, and
published his memoirs, which have been several times
reprinted—the last edition in 1794; and it is proved
by the most respectable testimony that he was the
author. In 1789, he presented a petition to parliament
for the suppression of the slave trade.</p>
        <p>He also says, that a son of his, named Sancho,
having received a good education, was an assistant
librarian to Sir Joseph Banks, and secretary to the
committee for vaccination. And he concludes with
this remark: “If Vassa still lived, the bill which was
lately passed, prohibiting the slave trade, would be
consoling to his heart, and to his old age.”</p>

        <pb id="color182" n="182"/>
        <head>BILLY AND JENNY.</head>
        <p>ABOUT the year 1738, a man and his wife, named
Tom and Caty, who were in bondage to Thomas
Bowne, on Long Island, had a little son whom they
called Billy. This little boy, when old enough to
work, was sold to a farmer in the neighborhood;
who, according to the custom of those days, went with
his servants into the field, and allotted to each one
his portion of labor. By this means, Billy became
acquainted with the different branches of husbandry,
and was inured to industry.</p>
        <p>With this farmer, he was pretty comfortably cared
for, and kept to his daily labor until the thirty-first
year of his age. About the year 1744, the master of
one of those ships employed in bringing the poor
Africans from their native land, among others brought
away a little girl—too young, alas! to tell even by
what means, or in what way she was taken.</p>
        <p>This little girl, after suffering all the hardships
attendant on her situation, and a long confinement on
shipboard, was landed in New York, and sold according
to the custom of that time. She was bought by
Samuel Underhill, and taken to Long Island to wait
on his wife and children and they called her Jenny.
As she advanced in age, she became more and more
useful in her master's family, and satisfied with her
situation.</p>
        <p>Her mistress being a woman of an uncommonly
amiable disposition, having known the subjugation of
<pb id="color183" n="183"/>
her own will, by the operation of that principle which
brings into harmony all the discordant passions, and
one of that description also, that “looked well to the
ways of her household, and ate not the bread of idleness,”
she was qualified to govern her family with
mildness and discretion, and to set them an example
of economy, sobriety, cheerfulness, and industry.</p>
        <p>Jenny, being placed under the tuition of such a
mistress, in due time became qualified to fill the
station allotted her with propriety, as an honest, sober,
industrious, and useful servant. When she had
arrived at about the twentieth year of her age, she was
visited by the before-mentioned Billy, in the character
of a suitor. After mature deliberation, and their
affections becoming more strongly fixed, with the
approbation of those concerned, the marriage ceremony
was performed.</p>
        <p>Thus were they united, not only in the bonds of
wedlock, but those of sincere affection, which abundantly
manifested itself in their conduct toward and
respect for each other, during a long and laborious
life, and in their care of their numerous offspring,
which consisted of nine sons and one daughter.</p>
        <p>Time passing on with them, they partook of such a
share of happiness as their situation in life would
permit, until the year 1769, when the master of
Jenny, having purchased a farm in Westchester
county, was preparing to remove his family thither.
This circumstance became a very close trial to this
affectionate pair, who by this time had several children.</p>
        <pb id="color184" n="184"/>
        <p>The thoughtfulness and anxiety felt by them on
this occasion being reciprocated by their masters, a
proposition was made for an exchange. The wife of
one of Billy's fellow-servants being in the family with
Jenny, accommodations were soon made, and Billy was
admitted a resident in the family with his beloved
partner: when they all proceeded to their new settlement,
where they lived in harmony and concord for
many years, and until their master's children were all
married and settled.</p>
        <p>During this period, Billy and Jenny, with all their
children, were liberated by their master, and such of
them as were old enough, were placed where they
might be brought up to habits of industry, and be
prepared to provide for themselves a comfortable
subsistence; but Billy and Jenny remained with him.</p>
        <p>Age and infirmity at length put a period to their
kind master's life. And his family, being thus
deprived of his care and exertions, were induced to
leave their abode. The mistress, who had long
exercised an affectionate care over her household, finding
herself lonely, retired to live with her children. And
with her youngest son, she remained to an advanced
age, and was then gathered into rest, as a shock of
corn in its season.</p>
        <p>Billy and Jenny having a house provided for them,
remained under the care of their former master's
descendants, and with their own industry, and the
generosity of their friends, they were comfortably
situated. But when Billy was so disabled by infirmity,
<pb id="color185" n="185"/>
that he could not work as a day-laborer, he cultivated
a little garden, and did some light jobs for his
neighbors.</p>
        <p>Their children being out, while Jenny's health and
strength remained, she went out to washing and
house-cleaning. Billy generally waited on her to the place
of destination, and then, returning to his habitation,
nursed his garden and poultry until toward evening,
when he would go to accompany her home. More
genuine politeness and unremitting attention, between
a man and his wife, are rarely to be found, in
city or country, than were manifested by this sable
pair.</p>
        <p>Thus they lived several years; but Jenny at length
became enfeebled by age, and her sight failed, so that
she was no longer capable of laboring abroad, or using
her spinning-wheel at home, as heretofore, which
made it necessary for them to be placed in a different
situation. One winter, while they remained at
house-keeping, there came a very severe snow-storm, with
high wind, so that passing from one place to another
was rendered very difficult for several days.</p>
        <p>As soon as practicable, their friend, who had the
care of them, and supplied their wants, went to see
how they fared; when Jenny, meeting him at the
door, and being asked how they were, etc., said, “Oh,
Master Richard, I am wonderful glad to see thee—if
the storm had lasted much longer I believe we
should have froze to death; our wood was most
gone, and Billy is one of the honestest niggers in the
<pb id="color186" n="186"/>
world; for he had rather freeze to death than steal a
rail from the fence.” This circumstance is recorded
as one specimen of their honest simplicity.</p>
        <p>In the spring of 1815, they were removed to the
habitation of one of their sons, where they were
boarded; and there they remained, until death, the
destroyer of all earthly comforts, put a period to
Jenny's life, after a few days' severe illness, about the
seventy-eighth year of her ago.</p>
        <p>The same affectionate attachment that pervaded
her mind in youth and in health, remained unshaken
to the last. Her sight, as before remarked, being
almost gone, when lying on her bed, she frequently
inquired for Billy; but when she was told he was
lying behind her, or sitting by her, she was satisfied.</p>
        <p>Thus she closed a long and laborious life, beloved
and respected for her many good qualities, and her
consistent conduct. Billy died at Scarsdale,
Westchester county, New York, on the 4th of Third month,
1826, after a few days' illness, aged about eighty-seven
years, and was decently interred by the side of Jenny,
on the 6th of the same month.</p>

        <head>GEORGE HARDY.</head>
        <p>During the winter of 1832, the writer of the narrative
of which this account is an abridgment, became
acquainted with Hannah Hardy, an interesting old
<pb id="color187" n="187"/>
colored woman, and her son George. They were the
suffering tenants of a miserable garret, lighted only
by a few panes of glass, and ill-secured from the
<sic corr="inclemency">inclemencies</sic> of the weather.</p>
        <p>Hannah had been an industrious woman, who
supported herself comfortably for many years, until her
sight, which had long been declining, so nearly left
her as to disqualify her for all kinds of work. George,
who was her youngest son, disclosed in his earliest
years great quickness of discernment and readiness of
apprehension. He could read the Bible when only
four years old; and he continued to be remarkable
for docility, and for preferring his books and other
profitable employments to the idle sports of children.</p>
        <p>When about eleven years old, he was placed from
home, where he remained until four years since, when
he became so much diseased with scrofula as to make
it necessary for him to return to his mother. From
that time, she became his constant and only nurse,
and evinced, through numberless privations and
difficulties, the most unwearied attention and patient
endurance.</p>
        <p>When he was able to sit up and use his arms, he
made rope-mats; by which, with casual help from his
friends, he supported his mother and paid her rent.
He always mended his own and her clothes, and
allowed no time to pass away in idleness, which he
was able to employ; and so cheerful, so thankful, and
so happy did this interesting couple appear, that it
afforded a lesson of instruction to be with them.</p>
        <pb id="color188" n="188"/>
        <p>Hannah, who could only distinguish the glare of
noon from the gloom of darkness, had lived so long
in the forlorn tenement they then inhabited, and
knew so well all the turnings of its steep and dangerous
stairs, that she could not bear to hear the
proposal from some of her friends to provide one more
comfortable. Through the latter part of the winter,
and the commencement of the spring, George's sufferings
greatly increased; he was wholly confined to his
bed, and so emaciated with pain and disease, that
although he was seventeen years of age, his arms were
not thicker than an infant's.</p>
        <p>He had been a diligent reader of the Holy Scriptures;
and though he told me they had been to
him a sealed book, until he was brought to that bed
of suffering, yet it was evident that his mind had long
been enabled to appropriate to his own necessities
many of their precious precepts. Though he labored
under the combined effects of scrofula and dropsy, in
their highest degrees of virulence, yet I never heard
him repine; and often, while suffering extreme bodily
anguish, he would speak of the relief it afforded the
poor afflicted body, to have the mind composed and
tranquil, and would say, “O, I feel like a poor worm
in the fire; yet all I desire is, to be favored with
patience to bear all my pain, and with a willing mind
to wait the Master's will to take me away.”</p>
        <p>For many days and nights together he was able to
obtain but little sleep; yet he showed no marks of
restlessness or discontent. Once, calling me to his
<pb id="color189" n="189"/>
bedside, he said, “I am afraid I am not patient
enough; but I often feel very weary, and I fear I
shall wear my poor mother out. I am more
concerned for her than for myself—what should I do for
a care-taker if she were gone? She is very kind to
me, and I have many kind friends. I am afraid I am
not grateful enough for all my favors. To some, this
garret would look like a dull place, but it never looks
gloomy to me; I have had more pleasure in it than I
could have had in the nicest parlor.”</p>
        <p>Having called one day after he had passed a sleepless
and languishing night, I found him, with the
Bible fixed before him, reading. He looked animated,
and said, “I always loved to read the Bible, but I
never understood it until very lately; now I understand
it, and I find that religion and pleasure are in
no way inconsistent. I feel now that I shall never
recover. I am willing to die, and I shall be happy
when I am gone from earth—but the Lord is very
merciful, and can make me happy as long as He
chooses that I should stay. I have trusted in Him
through pain and through want, and I believe He
will never forsake me. My Fifth has sometimes been
closely tried, but I never let go my confidence.”</p>
        <p>His disease now rapidly increased, and with it his
suffering. On the 23d of Fifth month, he conversed
a long time with the doctor, and seemed more
comfortable than usual; but he passed a sleepless and
distressing night. The next day, he was able to take
but little nourishment, owing to the great soreness of
<pb id="color190" n="190"/>
his mouth and throat, but he could converse
intelligibly, and seemed anxious to do so. About two
o'clock this day, I found him in great pain, but quite
tranquil in mind.</p>
        <p>On my going to him, he said, “My sufferings are
now nearly over; I shall not live many days—not
more than two. The Lord's time has nearly come,
and then He will take me where I shall never suffer
any more. O, how marvellous His mercy is, to
look down upon such a polluted sinner as I am!
<q direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>‘I the worst of sinners am,</l><l>But Jesus came to save me.’—</l></lg></q>
Yes, He will save me—I know it. I have a hope—
a pretty certain hope—O, it is a very certain hope—
it is a very sure hope.” He then in a low and indistinct
voice, supplicated for many minutes; after which
he said, “I have been talking to my Saviour.”</p>
        <p>Not expecting him to hear, I asked his mother if
he had always been a serious boy; but before she
could reply, George said, “No ! I was always bad,
always wicked; but since I was brought to this bed
of sickness, I have sought for repentance, and I have
found it: my sins were as scarlet, but now they are
washed as white as snow. But it is all mercy, pure
mercy; we have no righteousness of our own to
depend upon—no works, no merit of our own will
avail us at such a time as this. If these were all we
had to look to, we should never be saved. But this
<pb id="color191" n="191"/>
is what Jesus came into the world for—to save us
poor sinners; and salvation belongs to Him alone.”</p>
        <p>After this, he desired me to read to him in the
Bible—said he would like to hear me read in the
Psalms, where David deplored his sins. I did so,
and he afterward composed himself and slept a few
minutes; but the pain soon awoke him, and he said,
“I hope my patience will hold out—I must not get
impatient so near the end.”</p>
        <p>On the 25th, his sufferings greatly increased, and
on the afternoon of the 26th, he was unable longer to
speak, but he appeared to be sensible of what was
passing, and to know those about him. He several
times embraced his mother very tenderly and wept.
The impress which the pain and anguish of the
preceding day had left upon his countenance, now yielded
to a placid and heavenly serenity; and his breath
continued to shorten, until he ceased to breathe.</p>

        <head>LOTT CAREY.</head>
        <head>PRINCIPALLY FROM GURLEY'S LIFE OF ASHMUN.</head>
        <p>THIS interesting individual was born a slave, on
the estate of William A. Christian, in Charles City
county, about thirty miles below Richmond. In
1804, he was sent to that city, and hired out by the
year as a common laborer at the Shockoe warehouse,
<pb id="color192" n="192"/>
At that time, and for two or three years after, he
was excessively profane, and much addicted to
intoxication.</p>
        <p>But God, who is rich in mercy, was pleased to
awaken him to a sense of his lost estate; and in the
year 1807, he made open profession of his faith in the
Saviour. A sermon which he heard about that time,
founded on our Lord's interview with Nicodemus,
awakened in him so strong a desire to be able to read
and write, that he obtained a Testament, and commenced
learning his letters, by trying to read the
chapter in which that interview is recorded.</p>
        <p>He was occasionally instructed by young gentlemen
at the warehouse, though he never attended a regular
school. In a little time, he was able to read and
write, so as to make dray tickets, and superintend
the shipping of tobacco. In this business, and in
overseeing the labor of the other hands in the warehouse,
he was particularly useful; so much so, that
he received 800 dollars salary in 1820, the last year
he remained there; and he could have received a
larger sum, if he would have continued.</p>
        <p>In the year 1813, he bought himself and his two
little children (his wife being dead) for 850 dollars,
and thus became free. The manner in which he
obtained this sum of money to purchase himself and his
children, reflects much credit on his character. It
will be seen from the salary he received after he was
free, and which he relinquished for the sake of doing
good in Africa, that his services at the warehouse were
<pb id="color193" n="193"/>
highly estimated; but of their real value, no one except
a dealer in tobacco can form an idea. Notwithstanding
the hundreds of hogsheads that were committed
to his charge, he could produce any one the
instant it was called for; and the shipments were
made with a promptness and correctness, such as no
person has equalled in the same situation. For this
correctness and fidelity, he was highly esteemed, and
frequently rewarded by the merchant with a five-dollar
note. He was allowed also to sell for his benefit
many small parcels of waste tobacco. It was by saving
the little sums obtained in this way, with the aid
of a subscription by the merchants to whose interests
he had been attentive, that he procured these 850
dollars which he paid for the freedom of himself and
children. When the colonists were fitted out for
Africa, he defrayed a considerable part of his own
expense. With a design to improve his condition,
he emigrated to Africa among the first settlers of
Liberia, where he was the means of doing much good
to both colonists and natives.</p>
        <p>In reply to one of his friends, who desired to know
what inducement he had for going to Africa, when he
was already so comfortably situated, he said, “I am
an African; and in this country, however meritorious
my conduct and respectable my character, I cannot
receive the credit due to either. I wish to go to a
country where I shall be estimated by my merits, not
by my complexion. And I likewise feel bound to
labor for my suffering race.”</p>
        <pb id="color194" n="194"/>
        <p>Soon after he made a profession of religion he
commenced holding meetings and exhorting among the
colored people; and, though he had scarcely any
knowledge of books, and but little acquaintance with
mankind, he would frequently exhibit a boldness of
thought, and a strength of native intellect, which no
acquirement could ever have given him.</p>
        <p>At the close of his farewell sermon, on his departure
for Africa, he remarked in substance as follows:
“I am about to leave you; and I expect to see your
faces no more. I long to preach to the poor Africans
the way of life and salvation. I don't know what
may befall me—whether I may find a grave in the
ocean, or among the savage men, or more savage wild
beasts, on the coast of Africa: nor am I anxious what
may become of me; I feel it my duty to go.</p>
        <p>“I very much fear that many of those who preach
the gospel in this country will blush when the
Saviour calls them to give an account of their labors
in His cause, and tells them, ‘I commanded you to go
into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
creature.’ ” And with the most forcible emphasis he
exclaimed, “The Saviour may ask, ‘Where have you
been? What have you been doing ? Have you
endeavored to the utmost of your ability to fulfil the
commands I gave you? or have you sought your own
gratification and your own ease, regardless of my
commands?’ ”</p>
        <p>In his new home, his intellectual ability, firmness
of purpose, unbending integrity, correct judgment,
<pb id="color195" n="195"/>
and disinterested benevolence, caused him to be
beloved and respected, and gave him great influence:
and he soon rose to honorable distinction. The interests
of the colony, and the cause of his countrymen,
in both Africa and America, were very near to his
heart. For them he was willing to toil, and to make
almost any sacrifice; and he frequently declared that
no possessions in America could induce him to return.</p>
        <p>He possessed a constitution <sic corr="peculiarly">peculiarily</sic> fitted for
toil and exposure, and he felt the effects of the
climate perhaps less than any other individual in the
colony. During the sickly season of the year, he was
usually wholly employed in attending the sick; and
for more than a year, they had no other physician
among them. The little medical information he had
obtained from Dr. Ayres and others on the coast,
together with several years' experience, enabled him
successfully to contend with the peculiar fevers of the
climate.</p>
        <p>Under date of March 12th, 1824, shortly after the
arrival of the Cyrus with 105 emigrants, he wrote:
“The fever began about the 24th ult., and on the
28th we had thirty-eight cases; and by the 2d inst.
we had sixty-six under the operation of medicine;
and at present, I have about a hundred cases of fever
to contend with; but we have been very much favored,
for they all appear to be on the recovery, and we
have lost none, saving three children. I have very
little time to write to you, myself being the only man
<pb id="color196" n="196"/>
that will venture to act in the capacity of a physician.”</p>
        <p>The managers of the American Colonization Society,
in 1825, invited Carey to visit the United
States, in the expectation that his intelligent and
candid statements, concerning the condition and
prospects of the colony and the moral wants of Africa,
would exert a beneficial influence on the opinions of
the people of color, and recommend the cause of the
society to the public regard.</p>
        <p>In the month of April, 1826, he made arrangements
to embark in the Indian Chief, on her return from
taking a large number of emigrants to the colony,
and received from Ashmun testimonials of his worth
and services. The following is an extract from a letter
from Ashmun to the managers of the Colonization
Society:</p>
        <p>“The Rev. Lott Carey has, in my opinion, some
claims on the justice of the society, or the government
of the United States, or both, which merit consideration.
These claims arise out of a long and faithful
course of medical services rendered to this colony.
More than one-half of his time has been given up to
the care of the sick, from the day I landed in Africa
to the very moment of stating the fact. He has
personally aided, in every way that fidelity and benevolence
could dictate, in all the attentions which our
sick have in so long a period received.</p>
        <p>“Several times have these disinterested labors
reduced him to the very verge of the grave. He has
<pb id="color197" n="197"/>
hitherto received no compensation, either from the
society or the government, for these services. I need
<hi rend="italics">not</hi> add, that it has not been in his power to support
himself and family, by any use he could make of the
remnants of the time left him, after discharging the
amount of duties devolving upon him. In addition,
he has the care of the liberated Africans.”</p>
        <p>Until near the time of the Indian Chief's departure,
he cherished the hope of embarking in her for America.
But as there was no other physician in the
colony, it was finally thought best for him to postpone
his departure until another opportunity.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding he on one occasion manifested a
disposition for insubordination, yet, like a wise man
and a Christian, he soon saw his error, and
acknowledged it with humility and submission. He was
elected in September, 1826, to the vice-agency of the
colony, and discharged the duties of that important
office until his death.</p>
        <p>In his good sense, moral worth, public spirit,
courage, resolution, and decision, the colonial agent had
perfect confidence. He knew that in times of difficult
or of danger, full reliance might be placed upon
the energy and efficiency of Carey.</p>
        <p>When compelled, in the early part of 1828, to
leave the colony, Ashmun committed the administration
of the colonial affairs into the hands of the
vice-agent, in the full belief that no interest would be
betrayed, but that his efforts would be constantly and
anxiously directed to the promotion of the public good.</p>
        <pb id="color198" n="198"/>
        <p>Soon after Carey wrote thus: “Feeling very
sensibly my incompetency to enter upon the duties of
my office, without first making all the officers of the
colony well acquainted with the principal objects
which should engage our attention, I invited them to
meet at the Agency House on the 27th, at nine
o'clock, which was punctually attended to, and I then
read all the instructions left by Mr. Ashmun, without
reserve, and requested their <sic corr="cooperation">co-operation</sic>. To get
the new settlers located on their lands, was a very
important item in my instructions; and I trust,
through the blessing of the great Ruler of events, we
shall be able to realize all the expectations of Mr.
Ashmun.”</p>
        <p>He soon purchased a large tract of land for the
Colonization Society of the native kings; and further
said, “Captain Russell will be able to give something
like a fair account of the state of our improvements,
as he went with me to visit the settlements, and
seemed pleased with the prospect at Millsburg,
Caldwell, and the Halfway Farms.”</p>
        <p>For about six months after the departure of Ashmun
from the colony, Carey stood at its head, and
conducted himself with such energy and wisdom as to
do honor to his previous reputation, and fix the seal
upon his enviable fame. But, alas! he was suddenly
and unexpectedly, and in a distressing manner, forced
from life, in all its vigor, by the explosion of gunpowder,
on the 8th of November, in which eight persons
lost their lives.</p>
        <pb id="color199" n="199"/>
        <p>Carey was thrice married, and thrice he was left a
widower. His first wife died, as before related,
previous to his becoming free. His second wife died at
Foura Bay, near Sierra Leone, shortly after arriving
in Africa. Of her triumphant death, he has given a
most affecting account in his journal of that date.
His third wife died at Cape Montserado. She was
the daughter of Richard Sampson, from Petersburg.</p>
        <p>It has been very well said of Carey, that he was
one of nature's noblemen. Had he possessed the
advantages of education, few men of his age would have
excelled him in knowledge or genius. To found a
Christian colony which might prove a blessed asylum
to his degraded brethren in America, and enlighten
and regenerate Africa, was, in his view, an object
with which no temporal good, not even life, could be
compared.</p>
        <p>The strongest sympathies of his nature were
excited in behalf of his unfortunate people, and the
divine promise cheered and encouraged him in his
labors for their improvement and salvation. A main
pillar in the society and church of Liberia has fallen!
But we will not despond. The memorial of his
worth shall never perish. It shall stand in a clearer
light, when every chain is broken, and Christianity
shall have assumed her sway over the millions of
Africa.</p>

        <p>WARNER MIFFLIN, for his candor, affability, and
knowledge was ranked among those who are an honor
to their country and their age. He had received
from his father thirty-seven negroes, old and young.
The day that he had fixed upon for their emancipation
being come, he called one after another into his chamber,
and this was the conversation that passed with
one of them:</p>
        <p>“Well, my friend James, how old art thou?” “I
am twenty-nine and a half years old, master.” “Thou
shouldst have been free, as thy white brethren are, at
twenty-one. Religion and humanity enjoin me this
day to give thee thy liberty, and justice requires me
to pay thee for eight and a half years' service, at the
rate of twenty-one pounds and five shillings per annum,
including in it thy food and raiment, making
altogether a sum of ninety-five pounds, twelve shillings,
and sixpence owing to thee; but as thou art young
and healthy, thou hadst better work for thy living:
my intention is to give thee a bond for it, bearing
interest at the rate of seven per cent.</p>
        <p>“Thou hast now no master but God and the laws.
Go into the next room; thou wilt find there thy late
mistress and my nephew; they are engaged in writing
thy manumission. May God bless thee, James! Be
<pb id="color201" n="201"/>
wise and industrious; in all thy trials, thou wilt find
a friend in thy old master.”</p>
        <p>James, surprised at a scene so new and affecting,
shed many tears; astonishment, gratitude, and a
variety of feelings, shook his frame. He shed a flood of
tears, and could scarcely articulate these words: “Ah,
my master! why do you give me my liberty? I
have always had what I wanted: we have worked
together in the fields, and I have worked as much for
myself as for you.</p>
        <p>“I have eaten of the same food, and been clothed
like you—and we have gone together on foot to meeting.
We have the Sabbath to ourselves: we don't
lack any thing. When we are sick, our good and
tender mistress comes to our bedside, always saying
something consolatory to us. Ah, my dear master!
when I am free, where shall I go? and when I am
sick—”</p>
        <p>“Thou shalt be as the whites; thou shalt hire with
those who will give thee generous wages: in a few
years, thou shalt purchase a piece of land, marry a
wife, wise and industrious as thyself, and rear up
children, as I have reared thee, in the fear of the
Lord and love of labor. After having lived free and
happy, thou shalt die in peace.</p>
        <p>“Thou <hi rend="italics">must</hi> accept liberty, James; it is a great
while since it was due to thee. Would to God, the
Father of all men, that the whites had never thought
of trading in thy African brethren; may He inspire
all men with the desire of following our example.
<pb id="color202" n="202"/>
We, who regard liberty as the first of blessings, why
should we refuse it to those who live among us?”</p>
        <p>“Ah, my master! you are so good is the reason I
wish not to leave you—<hi rend="italics">I have never been a slave</hi>. You
have never spoken to me but as you speak to white
men; I have lacked nothing, either in sickness or in
health; I have never worked more than your neighbors,
who have worked for themselves.</p>
        <p>“I have been richer than many whites—to some of
whom I have lent money. And my good and tender
mistress never commands us to do anything, but
makes us do everything by only saying ‘Please to
do it.’ How shall I leave you ? give me by the year
what you will, in the name of a freeman or a slave, it
is of little consequence to me—I shall never be happy
but with you—I will never leave you.”</p>
        <p>“Well, James, I consent to what thou desirest;
after thy manumission shall have passed through the
necessary forms, I will hire thee by the year; but take
at least one of relaxation; it is a great epoch of thy
life; celebrate it with joy, and rest by doing whatsover
thou wilt.”</p>
        <p>“No master! it is seed time—I will take my pleasure
another time—one day only shall be a holiday in
my family. Then, since you will have it so, I will
accept my liberty; and my first action, as a free man,
is to take your hand, my master, press it between
mine, and lay it on my heart, where the attachment
and gratitude of James will not cease until that
ceases to beat; and until that moment be assured
<pb id="color203" n="203"/>
that no laborer in the county of Kent will be more
industrious than he who henceforth shall be called
FAITHFUL JAMES.”</p>

        <head>EZEKIEL COSTON,</head>
        <p>AGED upwards of eighty-three years, related to
Samuel Canby, of Wilmington, Delaware, in 1825,
the following circumstances of his freedom from his
master, the late Warner Mifflin, a Quaker: and it may
be observed, that he always supported an unblemished
character:</p>
        <p>That he was born a slave in the family of Daniel
Mifflin, of Accomack county, Virginia, with whom
he lived until about twenty years of age; about which
period Warner Mifflin (son of Daniel) married a
daughter of John Kensey's, of West River, Maryland,
and settled near Camden, in the State of Delaware.
Ezekiel, and five other slaves, were given him
by his father; there were also a number of slaves
belonging to his wife brought into the family.</p>
        <p>He lived with Warner Mifflin about eighteen
months, when he put him on a plantation of his to work
it, about six miles from his residence, where he
continued about four years a slave. At this period Ezekiel
was informed by his master that he had concluded
to set his slaves free; and very soon after his master
came to his residence, and calling him from the field
<pb id="color204" n="204"/>
where he was ploughing, they sat down together, when
he told Ezekiel his mind had long been uneasy with
holding slaves, and that he must let him go.</p>
        <p>Ezekiel was so well satisfied with his present situation,
that he told his master he could not leave him.
Their conversation on the subject produced such feelings
of tenderness that they <hi rend="italics">both wept much</hi>. Finally,
as an inducement to comply, his master told him he
might remain on the farm, and they entered into a
mutual engagement, which was carried into effect, and
Ezekiel continued to live on the farm fourteen years,
when his master gave him a piece of land, upon which
he built a house, where he remained until he came into
the neighborhood of Wilmington, where and in that
town he has resided until the present time.</p>
        <p>After relating the foregoing narrative, he was
inquired of respecting the account entitled “The Good
Master and his Faithful Slave”—a circumstance
which took place about the time of his being liberated,
and in the same family—to which he bore the
following testimony, shedding many tears while the
reader was pursuing the theme, saying, “It is just so,
poor Jem and I lived together with master, and
worked together in harmony. How well I remember
when Jem told me that Master Mifflin had done the
same by him as he had done for me.</p>
        <p>“It is all true—mistress brought a number of
slaves with her into the family, after master married
her—one of them was my wife—all the rest of us,
making, I suppose about thirty, were given by old
<pb id="color205" n="205"/>
master to Master Warner, who is now an angel in
heaven. Oh, how it comforts me to believe that, after
suffering a few more pains, I shall live with him for
ever in communion sweet! We were brought up
children together, slept together, eat at the same
table, and never quarrelled.”</p>
        <p>The dear old man seems indeed like one waiting
with Christian resignation for an entrance into the
heavenly kingdom. I have no doubt of the correctness
of his testimony. He appears to have as perfect
a recollection of the days of his childhood as though
they had just passed.</p>

        <head>AN ANECDOTE,</head>
        <head>Communicated to a Friend on the way from Charleston to<lb/>

        <p>A SLAVE boy belonging to his grandmother was carried
off when a boy by the British, in the time of the revolutionary
war, to Nova Scotia, where he lived several
years; but he did not forget his old home and friends,
and he returned to his mistress, giving himself up as
a slave. But she, not having employment for him,
talked of selling him. He told her if she did, he was
determined to destroy himself, for that it was nothing
but his attachment to the family that brought him
back. He was then suffered to work out, paying a
certain part of his wages to his owner.</p>
        <pb id="color206" n="206"/>
        <p>The family soon after became embarrassed; and one
of the grandsons was sent to the West Indies to a
relation. Just as he was embarking, the faithful black put
into his hand a purse containing all his little earnings,
and insisted upon his young master's taking it, saying
he had no use for the money himself, and his master
might want it in a strange country, away from his
friends. The slave, still living in Charleston, was
suffered to work for himself. He has had repeated
offers of his liberty, but he prefers living in the family
that brought him up.</p>

        <head>THE COLORED FOUNDLING.</head>
        <p>A POOR, but honest and respectable old man, whose
name was Hector, resided in Philadelphia. He and
his wife lived on the scanty earnings of their own
hands, in a very small cottage. One evening, at a
late hour, a woman of their own color, with an infant,
stopped at their dwelling and asked for a night's
lodging, to which his wife answered, “We can't lodge you,
we got but one bed.” “Oh,” said the old man, seeing
her a stranger and in difficulty, “let her tag [stay],
she sleep in de bed with you, I go make a bed on
de floor—must not turn her out o' doors.”</p>
        <p>The woman accordingly stayed; and in the night,
Hector was awakened by the cries of the child. He
arose to ascertain the cause of it, and found the mother
was gone; on which he aroused his wife, saying,
<pb id="color207" n="207"/>
“Well, Sukey, you see de woman has gone off and
lef' de child for you.” “Oh,” said his wife, “what
shall we do now ? She never come again.” “Well,”
returned Hector, “then you must take care of him:
who knows God Almighty send him here for
something—may be to take care of us in our old age—must
not turn him out o' doors.”</p>
        <p>So they fed and nourished it with milk from the
market—the old man going regularly to procure it,
No one appearing, the child became their adopted.
When he had attained the age of eight or nine years,
proving an active lad, they put him to a chimney
sweeper, as the most likely way for him to become
early useful, and he soon contributed a little to his
guardian's subsistence.</p>
        <p>They at length grew quite infirm, and the wife died.
After which, the neighbors, thinking it too much for
the lad to have the whole care of the old man,
prevailed on him to go to the Bettering House. When
there the boy did not forsake but frequently visited
him, and continued to add to his support until he
died; a few days after which the lad died also, having
grown up beloved and respected.</p>

        <head>THE GRATEFUL NEGRO.</head>
        <p>SOME years since, a gentleman, who was the
possessor of considerable property, from various causes
became embarrassed in his circumstances and was
arrested by his creditors, and confined in the king's
bench prison; whence there was no probability of his
being liberated, unless some law proceedings (upon
his succeeding in which the recovery of a great part
of his property depended) were decided in his favor.</p>
        <p>Thus situated, he called a colored man who had for
many years served him with the greatest faithfulness,
and said, “Robert, you have lived with me many
years, but I am now unable to maintain you any
longer; you must leave me, and endeavor to find
another master.”</p>
        <p>The poor man, well remembering his master's
kindness, replied, “No, massa, me no leave you; you
maintain me many years, me now try what I can do
for you.” Robert then went and procured employment
as a day laborer, and regularly brought his
earnings to his master; on which, though small, they
managed to subsist for some time, until the law-suit
was decided in the master's favor, and he thereby
regained possession of a very considerable property.</p>
        <p>Mindful of his faithful servant, one of his first acts
was to settle an annuity upon him for the remainder
of his life, sufficient to secure to the poor fellow the
enjoyment of those comforts he had so well deserved.

        <head>JAMES DERHAM,</head>
        <p>ORIGINALLY a slave in Philadelphia, was sold by
his master to a physician, who employed him in his
shop as assistant in the preparation of drugs. During
the war between America and England he was sold to
a surgeon, and by that surgeon to Dr. Robert Dove,
of New Orleans. He learned the English, French,
and Spanish languages, so as to speak them with
ease.</p>
        <p>He was received a member of the English church;
and in the year 1788, when he was about twenty-one
years of age, he became one of the most distinguished
physicians in New Orleans. “I conversed with him

        <head>THE AFRICAN PRINCE.</head>
        <p>IN the most flourishing period of the reign of Louis
XIV. two African youths, the sons of a prince, being
brought to the court of France, the king appointed a
Jesuit to instruct them in letters and in the Christian
religion; and gave to each of them a commission in
his guards. The elder, who was remarkable for candor
and ingenuousness, made great improvement, more
particularly in the doctrines of religion.</p>
        <p>A brutal officer, upon some dispute, insulted him
with a blow. The gallant youth never so much as
offered to resent it. A person who was his friend
took an opportunity to talk with him that evening
alone upon his behavior, which he told him was too
tame, especially in a soldier. “Is there then,” said
the young African, “one revelation for soldiers, and
another for merchants and gownsmen? The good
father to whom I owe all my knowledge, has earnestly
inculcated in me forgiveness of injuries; assuring me
that a Christian was by no means to retaliate abuses
of any kind.”</p>
        <p>“The good father,” replied his friend, “may fit you
for a monastery, by his lessons, but never for the
army and the rules of a court. In a word,” continued
he, “if you do not call the colonel to an account, you
will be branded with the infamy of cowardice, and
have your commission taken from you.” “I would
fain,” said the young man, “act consistently in every
<pb id="color213" n="213"/>
thing; but since you press me with that regard to my
honor which you have always shown, I will wipe off
so foul a stain; though I must own I gloried in it before.”</p>
        <p>Immediately upon this, he desired his friend to go
from him, and appoint the aggressor to meet him early
in the morning. Accordingly, they met and fought,
and the brave African youth disarmed his adversary,
and forced him to ask his pardon publicly. This
done, the next day he threw up his commission, and
desired the king's leave to return to his father.</p>
        <p>At parting, he embraced his brother and his friends,
with tears in his eyes, saying that he had not imagined
Christians to be so unaccountable a people; that he
could not apprehend their faith could be of any use to
them, if it did not influence their practice; and that,
in his country, they thought it no dishonor to act
according to the principles of their religion.</p>

        <head>UNCLE HARRY.
</head>
        <bibl>FROM THE LITERARY AND EVANGELICAL MAGAZINE,
1824.</bibl>
        <p>LATE in the last autumn it was my privilege (says
the author) to spend a few hours in the hospitable
mansion of the Rev. S. B. W., of F. I arrived at his
house very early in the morning, just before the
family assembled to perform their customary
<pb id="color214" n="214"/>
devotions. On the signal being given, the children and
domestics came into the room where we were sitting.</p>
        <p>Among the latter, there was a very aged colored
man, whom every one called Uncle Harry. As soon
as he entered, I observed that Mr. W. and his lady
treated him with marked attention and kindness.
The morning was sharp and frosty, and Uncle Harry
had a chair in the corner, close to the fire.</p>
        <p>The portion of Scripture selected for the service
was the second chapter of Luke. I observed that the
attention of Harry was deeply fixed, and he soon
began to manifest strong emotions. The old man's eye
kindled as the reader went on, and when he came to
the tenth verse, Harry appeared as though his heart
was tuned to the angelic song, and he could hardly
help uttering a shout of triumph.</p>
        <p>There was, not, however, the smallest ostentation
of feeling, or endeavor to attract attention. He only,
in a gentle manner, turned his face upward, strongly
clasping his hands as they lay on his lap, and expressing
by his countenance the joy of his heart. By this
time he had interested me so highly that I could not
keep my eyes from him.</p>
        <p>I watched the varying expressions of his countenance,
and saw that every word seemed to strike on
his heart, and produce a corresponding emotion. I
thought I would give the world, if I could <hi rend="italics">read</hi> the
Bible just as Harry <hi rend="italics">heard</hi> it. While I was thinking,
and looking on with intense interest, the reader came
to the passage where old Simeon saw the infant
<pb id="color215" n="215"/>
Saviour, took him in his arms, blessed God, and said<sic corr="comma">.</sic>
“Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,
for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.”</p>
        <p>Harry's emotion had become stronger and stronger,
until the words just quoted were read, when he was
completely overpowered. Suddenly turning on his
seat, to hide as much as possible his feelings, he bent
forward and burst into a flood of tears; but they
were tears of joy. He anticipated his speedy peaceful
departure and his final rest. This state of feeling
continued during the remainder of the service, and
when we rose from our knees, Uncle Harry's face
seemed literally to have been bathed in tears.</p>
        <p>As soon as we had risen, the old man came toward
me with a countenance beaming with joy. “This,”
said Mr. W., addressing me, “is <hi rend="italics">Uncle Harry</hi>.” He
reached out his hand and said: “Oh, why did my
God bring me here to-day, to hear what I have heard
and see this salvation?” I asked: “Are you as
ready to depart, Uncle Harry, as good old Simeon
was, of whom we read in this chapter?” I shall
never forget his look of humble, joyful submission,
when he replied, “Just when it shall please my blessed
Lord and Master.” “You hope to go to heaven?”
“Through divine mercy, I do.” “What is the
foundation of that hope?” “The righteousness of our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.”</p>
        <p>On perceiving that I wished to converse with the
old man, Mr. W. said, with a kindness which showed
that he recognized Harry as a Christian brother, and
<pb id="color216" n="216"/>
respected his age: “Come, take your seat again,
Uncle Harry, and sit up near the fire.” He accepted
the invitation, and I entered into conversation, which
afforded me higher pleasure than I ever enjoyed in
the circles of fashion, beauty, wit and learning. I
here send you some of the most interesting particulars.</p>
        <p>“How old are you, Uncle Harry?” “Why, as
nigh as I can tell, I am eighty-nine or thereabout.”
“Where were you born?” “At Port Tobacco, in
Maryland.” “And who had you to preach the gospel
to you there?” “Ah, we had no preacher of the
gospel there at that time.” “Then it was after you
left Port Tobacco that you embraced religion, was
it?” “No, sir, it was while I lived there, and I
will tell you how it was: A great many years ago
there was one Dr. Whitefield, that travelled all
through this country, preaching the gospel everywhere;
I dare say you have heard of Dr. Whitefield,
he was a most powerful preacher.</p>
        <p>Well, as I was saying, he went through Maryland,
but his place of preaching was so far off that I
did not hear of it until he was gone. But not long
afterwards I met a man, an acquaintance of mine, who
did hear him. He told me about the sermon; and
what I heard opened my eyes to see that I was a poor
lost sinner; and ever since that time I have been
determined to seek Jesus as my Saviour, and to spend
my life in His service.”</p>
        <p>Happy Whitefield! thought I, and greatly honored
<pb id="color217" n="217"/>
of thy Master, who has used thee as His instrument
in saving so many souls. “But,” said I, “how old
were you then?” “Why, as nigh as I can guess, I
was somewhere about sixteen or seventeen years old.”
“And have you never repented of this resolution?”
“No, indeed, master; I have never repented of any
thing, but that I have served my blessed Saviour so
poorly.”</p>
        <p>“But have you not met many trials and difficulties
by the way?” “Yes, indeed, master; but out of
them all the Lord has delivered me; and having
obtained help of God, I continue to this day: blessed be
His name; He never will leave me or forsake me; I
have good hope of that.”</p>
        <p>“Well, how did you obtain religious instruction
where you lived, as you say there was no preacher of
the gospel in the neighborhood?” “Why, by the
mercy of my God, I learned to read the Bible; and
that showed me the way to Jesus. But now I think
of it, when the Roman Catholics heard that I was
concerned about my soul, they sent for me, and tried
hard to get me to join them.</p>
        <p>“There was a priest at Port Tobacco, whose name
was Mr. O'Neal; he talked to me a great deal. I
remember he said to me one day, ‘Harry, now you
are concerned about your soul, you must come and
join the Catholic church.’ ‘What for,’ said I, ‘Mr.
O'Neal?’ ‘Because,’ said he, ‘it is the true church.’
‘Then,’ said I, ‘if the Catholic church will lead me to
Jesus, I will join it with all my heart, for that is all
<pb id="color218" n="218"/>
I want;’ and Mr. O'Neal said, ‘If you will join the
church, I will warrant that you shall go to heaven.’
‘How can you do that, Mr. O'Neal?’ said I.</p>
        <p>“Then he told me that a great many years ago our
Saviour came into the world, and He chose twelve
apostles, and made St. Peter their head; and the
Pope succeeded St. Peter; and so all that join the
Pope belong to the true church. ‘Then,’ said I,
‘why, how do you know that, Mr. O'Neal?’
‘Because,’ said he, ‘our Saviour told Peter, I give you the
keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatsoever you
bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and
whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.’</p>
        <p>“And I said, ‘The Lord knows how it is, Mr.
O'Neal; I am a poor ignorant creature, but it always
did seem to me that Peter was nothing but a man,
like the other apostles;’ but Mr. O'Neal said, ‘No,
he was the head and chief of the apostles; for our
Saviour said again, Thou art Peter, and on this rock
I will build My church; and the gates of hell shall
not prevail against it.’ And I asked him, ‘Now, do
you think Peter was that rock, Mr. O'Neal?’ He
answered, ‘To be sure he was;’ and I said again,
‘The Lord knows how it is; but it never did seem so
to me.</p>
        <p>“‘Now I think it was just so—when Peter said,
Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God, our
Saviour told him, Thou <hi rend="italics">art Peter</hi>,’ ” (while the old
man repeated the words, <hi rend="italics">Thou art Peter</hi>, he pointed
his finger at me, and looked me directly in the face,
<pb id="color219" n="219"/>
but as soon as he began the following part of the
quotation he brought his hand briskly down to his
knee, saying with emphasis, as he looked at himself),
“ ‘and upon this rock will I build My church; and
that rock was Christ; for it is written in another
place, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner-stone,
elect, precious; and he that believeth on Him shall
not be confounded; and that corner-stone is Christ.’</p>
        <p>“Then Mr. O'Neal said to me, ‘Why, Harry,
where did you learn that?’ I said, ‘From my
Bible.’ ‘Oh!’ said he, ‘you have no business with
the Bible; it will confuse and frustrate you.’ But I
said, ‘It tells me of my Saviour.’ Then a gentleman,
who was sitting by, said, ‘Oh! you might as well let
him alone, Mr. O'Neal; you cannot make anything of
him;’ and from that time I never had any desire to
join the Roman Catholics.”</p>
        <p>The narrative, of the truth of which I could not
entertain a moment's doubt, showed a promptness of
reply and an acquaintance with the Scriptures which
truly surprised me, and I remarked, “I suppose,
Uncle Harry , you take great pleasure in reading the
Bible?” “Ah, master! when I could read, it was
the pleasure of my life. But I am old now; and my
book is so rubbed that the print is dim, and I can
scarcely make out to read a word.”</p>
        <p>On this, Mr. W. said, “Well, Uncle Harry, you
shall have a new Bible. Do you call on Mr.—,
when you go down town, and he will give you a new
one from the Bible Society.” Harry bowed, and
<pb id="color220" n="220"/>
expressed gratitude for the kindness, but did not
manifest as much pleasure as I expected, considering how
highly he professed to value the Bible. While I was
wondering, and rather sorrowing on the account, I
observed the old man to be feeling, with an air of
embarrassment, in his pocket.</p>
        <p>At length he pulled out an old tattered case, which
appeared to have been long in use, and observed,
“This new Bible will not be of much use to me,
because my spectacles are so bad that they help me
very little in reading.” With that he opened his
case, and showed a pair of spectacles of the cheapest
sort, of which one glass was broken, and the other so
scratched, that it was wonderful that he could see
through it at all.</p>
        <p>Mr. W. no sooner observed this than he said,
“Well, Uncle Harry, you must have a new pair; do
call at Mr.—'s store, and tell him to let you have
a pair suited to your age, and I will settle with him
about it.” On hearing this, Harry's eyes gleamed
with joy, and he exclaimed, “Thank God! God
bless you, master! Now I shall have comfort again
in reading the Bible.” And I never saw a happier,
or a more grateful countenance.</p>
        <p>Presently, he said the wagon would soon call for
him to take him home, and he must go down town,
and be getting ready: on which he again thanked his
friend, and invoked a blessing on him and his family.
He then affectionately and respectfully took me by
the hand, and said, “I never saw you before, and I
<pb id="color221" n="221"/>
never shall see you again in this world; but I love
you as a minister of my blessed Lord and Master, and
I hope that I shall meet you in the house above.
Remember and pray for poor old Harry.”</p>
        <p>I squeezed his hand, and assured him of my
affectionate remembrance, and requested that he would
pray for me, and for the preachers of the Gospel
generally. “Oh!” said he, “may God Almighty bless all
the dear ministers of Christ, and enable them to call
many poor sinners to the dear Saviour! Oh! I do
love to hear of souls coming to Christ; and it is my
daily prayer—Thy kingdom come, and Thy will be
done on earth, as it is done in heaven!” With that
the old man took leave.</p>
        <p>I confess that I have often since wished to see him
and hold communion with him. There was about
him a spirit of piety and benevolence, of humble zeal
and fervent hope, of meekness and submission, which
I have rarely seen equalled. At the same time, there
was a degree of intelligence, an extent of religious
knowledge, which, in his condition, really surprised
and delighted me.</p>
        <p>I saw here one of the triumphs of divine grace. I
was made to appreciate the value and the excellence
of that religion which could take a poor slave, and so
transform him, that he was well nigh fitted to be a
companion of saints in light, and of just men made
perfect. And since I saw him, I have often prayed
that after the days of my wandering shall be over,
and all the sufferings of my life shall be endured, I
<pb id="color222" n="222"/>
may obtain a share in the rest, and a lot in the
inheritance, which I have no doubt are prepared for
Uncle Harry.</p>

        <head>THE HOSPITABLE NEGRO WOMAN.</head>
        <p>THE enterprising traveller, Mungo Park, was
employed by the African Association to explore the
interior regions of Africa. In this hazardous
undertaking, he encountered many dangers and difficulties.
His wants were often supplied, and his distress alleviated,
by the kindness and compassion of negroes. He
gives the following lively and interesting account of
the hospitable treatment he received from a poor
negro woman:</p>
        <p>“Being arrived at Sego, the capital of the kingdom
of Bambarra, situated on the banks of the Niger, I
wished to pass over to that part of the town in which
the king resides; but from the number of persons
eager to obtain a passage, I was under the necessity
of waiting two hours. During this time the people
who had crossed the river carried information to
Mansong, the king, that a white man was waiting for
a passage, and was coming over to see him.</p>
        <p>”He immediately sent over one of his chief men,
who informed me that the king could not possibly see
me until he knew what had brought me into this
country, and that I must not presume to cross the
river without the king's permission. He therefore
<pb id="color223" n="223"/>
advised me to lodge, for that night, in a distant
village, to which he pointed, and said that in the morning
he would give me further instruction how to
conduct myself. This was very discouraging. However,
as there was no remedy, I set off for the village;
where I found, to my great mortification, that no
person would admit me into his house.</p>
        <p>“From prejudices infused into their minds, I was
regarded with astonishment and fear; and I was
obliged to sit the whole day without victuals, in the
shade of a tree. The night threatened to be very
uncomfortable; the wind rose, and there was great
appearance of a heavy rain. The wild beasts too
were so numerous in the neighborhood, that I should
have been under the necessity of climbing up a tree,
and resting among the branches.</p>
        <p>“About sunset, however, as I was preparing to
pass the night in this manner, and had turned my
horse loose, that he might graze at liberty, a negro
woman, returning from the labors of the field, stopped
to observe me; and perceiving that I was weary and
dejected, she inquired into my situation. I briefly
explained it to her; after which, with looks of great
compassion, she took up my saddle and bridle, and
told me to follow her. Having conducted me into
her hut, she lighted a lamp, spread a mat on the floor,
and told me I might remain there for the night.</p>
        <p>“Finding I was very hungry, she went out to
procure me something to eat; and returned in a short
time with a very fine fish, which, having caused it to
<pb id="color224" n="224"/>
be half broiled upon some embers, she gave me for
supper. The rites of hospitality being thus performed
toward a stranger in distress, my worthy benefactress
(pointing to the mat, and telling me I might sleep
there without apprehension), called to the female part
of her family, who had stood gazing on me all the
while in fixed astonishment, to resume their task of
spinning cotton; in which they continued to employ
themselves a great part of the night.</p>
        <p>“They lightened their labor by songs, one of which
was composed extempore; for I was myself the
subject of it. It was sung by one of the young women,
the rest joining in a sort of chorus. The air was
sweet and plaintive, and the words, literally
translated, were these: ‘The winds roared, and the rain
fell. The poor white man, faint and weary, came and
sat under our tree. He has no mother to bring him
milk, no wife to grind his corn.’ <hi rend="italics">Chorus</hi>: ‘Let us
pity the white man; no mother has he to bring him
milk, no wife to grind his corn.’<ref targOrder="U" id="ref1" n="1" rend="sc" target="note1">*</ref></p>

          <p>* These simple and affecting sentiments have been very beautifully
versified.</p>

            <l>And ah! no wife's or mother's care,</l>

        <p>“Trifling as these events may appear to the reader,
they were to me affecting in the highest degree. I
<pb id="color225" n="225"/>
was oppressed by such unexpected kindness, and sleep
fled from my eyes. In the morning, I presented to
my compassionate landlady two of the four brass
buttons which remained on my waistcoat; the only
recompense it was in my power to make her.”</p>

        <head>GRATITUDE IN A LIBERATED SLAVE.</head>
        <p>SOME time in the year 1790 a member of the
Manumission Society, residing on Golden Hill (now called
John Street) in New York, observed, for a considerable
time, his front porch to be scrubbed and sanded,
every Seventh-day morning before the family were up.
<pb id="color226" n="226"/>
He ordered a servant to watch, and ascertain to whom
he was indebted for this singular mark of kindness.</p>
        <p>At an early hour in the morning a colored woman
was observed with her pail, brush, cloth, soap and
sand, carefully performing her accustomed task. The
domestic who had been on the watch followed her
home, and requested to know her inducements for
performing this service. Her reply was, “Massa got
me free, and I can do no less than scrub off the
stoop.” A gratitude so genuine and untainted is
rarely found among the most polished and refined
minds.</p>

        <head>AGNES MORRIS.</head>
        <p>ANOTHER narrative, respecting a dying woman,
displays a faith so strong, a hope so full of immortality,
as may lead the Christian reader to exclaim, “Let my
last hours be like those of this poor slave.” Agnes
Morris, a poor negro woman, sent a pressing request
to Mrs. Thwaites, a lady residing in Antigua, to visit
her: she was in the last stage of dropsy.</p>
        <p>This poor creature ranked among the lowest class
of slaves. Her all consisted of a little wattled<ref targOrder="U" id="ref2" n="2" rend="sc" target="note2">*</ref> hut
and a few clothes. Mrs. Thwaites, finding her at the
commencement of her illness in a very destitute
condition, mentioned her case to a friend, who gave her a
coat. When she paid her last visit, on her entering
the door, Agnes exclaimed, “Missis! you come!
<note id="note2" n="2" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref2">* Plaited twigs.</note>
<pb id="color227" n="227"/>
This tongue can't tell what Jesus do for me! Me
call my Saviour day and night; and He come”—laying
her hand on her breast—“He comfort me here.”</p>
        <p>On being asked if she was sure of going to heaven
when she died, she answered, “Yes, me sure. Me
see de way clear, and shine before me”—looking and
pointing upward with a smiling face. “If di dis
minute, Jesus will take me home, me ready.” Some
hymns being sung, she was in a rapture of joy; and
in reference to the words of one of them, exclaimed,
“For me—for me—poor sinner!”—lifting up her
swelled hands—“what a glory! what a glory!”</p>
        <p>Seeing her only daughter weeping, she said, “What
you cry for? No cry—follow Jesus—He will take
care of you.” And turning to Mrs. Thwaites, she
said, “Missis, show um de path: ” meaning the path
to heaven. Many other expressions fell from her of
a similar nature, to the astonishment of those who
heard her. It was understood she continued praying
and praising God to her latest breath.</p>
        <p>This poor creature was destitute of all earthly
comforts. Her bed was a board, with a few plantain
leaves over it. How many of these outcasts will be
translated from outward wretchedness to realms of
glory, there to mingle with the blessed, and sing
praises to Him who lives for ever!</p>

        <head>EXTRAORDINARY EXERTIONS TO OBTAIN<lb/>
LIBERTY.</head>
        <p>THAT human being who would run the gauntlet
for freedom so desperately as the poor African
appears to have done, whose story is given below, surely
should never again be brought under the lash of a
taskmaster. The captain of a vessel from North
Carolina called upon the police for advisement respecting
a slave he had unconsciously brought away in his
vessel, under the following curious circumstances:</p>
        <p>Three or four days after he had got to sea he began
to be haunted every hour with tones of distress
seemingly proceeding from a human voice in the very
lowest part of the vessel. A particular scrutiny was
finally instituted, and it was concluded that the creature,
whatever or whoever it might be, must be confined
down in the run under the cabin floor; and on
boring a hole with an auger, and demanding, ‘<hi rend="italics">Who's
there?</hi>’ a feeble voice responded, ‘<hi rend="italics">Poor negro, massa!</hi>’
It was clear enough then that some runaway
negro had hid himself there before they sailed, trusting
to Providence for his ultimate escape.</p>
        <p>Having discovered him, however, it was impossible
to give him relief, for the captain had stowed even
the cabin so completely full of cotton as but just to
leave room for a small table for himself and the mate
to eat on; and as for unloading at sea, that was pretty
much out of the question. Accordingly, there he had
<pb id="color229" n="229"/>
to lie, stretched at full length, for the tedious interval
of <hi rend="italics">thirteen days</hi>, till the vessel arrived in port and
unloaded, receiving his food and drink through the
auger hole.</p>
        <p>The fellow's story is, now he is released, that, being
determined to get away from slavery, he supplied
himself with eggs, and biscuit, and some jugs of water,
which latter he was just on the point of depositing in
his lurking-place, when he discovered the captain at a
distance coming on board, and had to hurry down as
fast as possible and leave them; that he lived on
nothing but his eggs and biscuit till discovered by
the captain, not even getting a drop of water, except
what he had the good fortune to catch in his hand one
day, when a vessel of water in the cabin was overset,
during a squall, and some of it ran down through the
cracks of the floor over him.</p>

        <head>WILLIAM BOWEN.</head>
        <p>DIED, near Mount Holly, New Jersey, 12th of
sixth month, 1824, in the 90th year of his age,
William Bowen, a man of color. The deceased was one
of those who have demonstrated the truth of that
portion of Scripture that, “in every nation, he that feareth
God and worketh righteousness is accepted with
Him.”</p>
        <p>He was concerned in early life to do justly, love
<pb id="color230" n="230"/>
mercy, and walk humbly with his God; and by closely
attending to the light of Christ, and faithfully abiding
under the operation of that blessed spirit of Divine
Grace in his soul, he was enabled not only to bear
many precious testimonies, through his life, but to
bring forth those fruits of the Spirit which redound
to the glory of God and to the salvation of the soul.</p>
        <p>He was an exemplary member of the religious
Society of Friends. As he lived so he died, a rare
pattern of a self-denying follower of Jesus Christ. He
had no apparent disease either of body or mind; and
as he expressed himself, but a short time before his
death, “he felt nothing but weakness,” which
continued to increase until he gently breathed his last,

        <head>ANTHONY BENEZET.</head>
        <p>DIED, on the 3d of fifth month, 1784, Anthony
Benezet, aged 71 years, a member of the Society of
Friends. It was a day of sorrow. The afflicted
widow, the unprotected orphan, and the poor of all
descriptions, had lost the sympathetic mind of Benezet.
Society lamented the extinguishment of the
brilliant light of his philanthropy.</p>
        <p>The wandering tribes in the American wilderness,
<pb id="color231" n="231"/>
and the oppressed Africans, were indeed bereft; for
his willing pen and tongue had ceased forever to
portray the history of their injuries, or plead for the
establishment of their rights, before the sons of men.</p>
        <p>At internment of his remains, in Friends' burial
ground in Philadelphia, was the greatest concourse of
people that had ever been witnessed on such an
occasion; being a collection of all ranks and professions
among the inhabitants; thus manifesting the
universal esteem in which he was held.</p>
        <p>Among others who paid that last tribute of respect
were many hundred colored people, testifying, by their
attendance and by their tears, the grateful sense they
entertained of his pious efforts in their behalf. Having
no children, by his will he bequeathed his estate
to his wife during her natural life. At her decease,
he directed several small sums to be paid to poor and
obscure persons.</p>
        <p>The residue he devised in trust to the overseers of
the public school, “to hire and employ a religious-minded
person or persons to teach a number of negro,
mulatto or Indian children to read, write, arithmetic,
plain accounts, needle-work, etc. And it is my
particular desire, founded on the experience I have had
in that service, that, in the choice of such tutor,
special care may be taken to prefer an industrious,
careful person, of true piety, who may be or become
suitably qualified, he would undertake the service
from a principle of charity, to one more highly learned
not equally disposed.”</p>
        <pb id="color232" n="232"/>
        <p>He also bequeathed, as a special legacy, the sum of
fifty pounds to the Society in Pennsylvania for the
promotion of the abolition of slavery. Thus closed
the life of this great and good man. Dispensing his
blessings with his own hand, he was too liberal to be
a man of wealth. He was a native of France; and in
the ancient records of his family are exhibited
evidences of religious character in his predecessors.</p>
        <p>Connected with the demise of his grandfather, the
event is said to be, “to the great affliction of his
children, and the universal regret of his relatives and
friends, for he was a model of virtue and purity, and
lived in the constant fear of God.” Attached to the
birth-note of his grandson Anthony, are these
expressions: “May God bless him, in making him a
partaker of his mercies.” Though virtue is not hereditary,
it must be admitted that example is powerful.</p>
        <p>Among the productions of Anthony Benezet's pen,
was, “An historical account of Guinea, its situation,
produce, and the general disposition of its inhabitants;
with an inquiry into the rise and progress of
the slave trade, its nature, and calamitous effects.”</p>
        <div2 type="text">
          <head><hi rend="italics">Note from the Memoirs of A. Benezet</hi>.</head>
          <p>The influence of this work, in giving an impulse to
the mind of the indefatigable and benevolent Thomas
Clarkson, whose exertions contributed so much toward
bringing about the abolition of the slave trade by the
British Parliament, is certainly remarkable. In the
<pb id="color233" n="233"/>
year 1785, Dr. Peckard, vice-chancellor of the
University of Cambridge, proposed to the senior Bachelors
of Arts, of whom Clarkson was one, the following
question for a Latin dissertation: viz. (in English),
“Is it right to make slaves of others against their
will?</p>
          <p>Having in the former year gained a prize for the
best Latin dissertation, he resolved to maintain the
classical reputation he had acquired by applying
himself to the subject; but it was one with which he was
by no means familiar, and he was at a loss what
authors to consult respecting it; “when going by
accident,” he says, “into a friend's house, I took up a
newspaper then lying on the table.</p>
          <p>“One of the articles which attracted my notice,
was an advertisement of Anthony Benezet's historical
account of Guinea. I soon left my friend and his
paper, and, to lose no time, hastened to London to
buy it. In this precious book I found almost all I
wanted.” The information furnished by Benezet's
book encouraged him to complete his essay, which
was rewarded with the first prize; and from that
moment, Clarkson's mind became interested with the
great subject of the abolition.</p>

        <head>EXTRAORDINARY MUNIFICENCE.
</head>
        <bibl>FROM THE GENIUS OF UNIVERSAL EMANCIPATION—
1825.</bibl>
        <p>A PARAGRAPH has lately gone the round of the
papers announcing that a gentleman of Virginia had
emancipated <hi rend="italics">upwards of eighty slaves</hi>, and chartered
a vessel to send them at his own expense to Hayti,
but without giving the name of the author of so
distinguished an act of munificence.</p>
        <p>“We think it due to justice,” says the Norfolk
Herald, “to supply this deficiency, and to add the
following facts, which have been communicated to us
by gentlemen familiar with them, as well as by
Captain Russell, one of the owners of the brig Hannah
and Elizabeth, of Baltimore, the vessel chartered.</p>
        <p>“The gentleman who has thus distinguished himself,
is David Minge, of Charles City county, living
near Sandy Point, on James River. Captain Russell
informs us that there were put on board the Hannah
and Elizabeth eighty-seven colored people of different
ages, from three months to forty years, being all the
slaves Mr. Minge owned, except two old men, whom
he had likewise manumitted, but who, being past
service, he retains and supports them.</p>
        <p>“The value of these negroes, at the prices now
going, might be estimated at about twenty-six thousand
dollars! and Mr. Minge expended, previous to
their embarkation, about twelve hundred dollars in
<pb id="color235" n="235"/>
purchasing ploughs, hoes, iron, and other articles of
husbandry for them; besides providing them with
several suits of clothes to each, provisions, groceries,
cooking utensils, and everything which he supposed
they might require for their comfort during the
passage, and for their use after their arrival out. He
also paid sixteen hundred dollars for the charter of
the vessel.</p>
        <p>“But Mr. Minge's munificence does not end here.
On the bank of the river, as they were about to go on
board, he had a peck of dollars brought down, and
calling them around him, under a tree, he distributed
the hoard among them, in such sums, and under such
regulations, that each individual did, or would, receive
seven dollars.</p>
        <p>“By this provision, Mr. Minge thought his
emigrants would be enabled to commence the cultivation
of the soil immediately after their arrival, without
being dependent on President Boyer for any favor
whatever, unless the permission to improve the
government lands be so considered.</p>
        <p>“Mr. Minge is about twenty-four or twenty-five
years of age, unmarried, and unencumbered in every
respect; possesses an ample fortune, and received the
benefits of a collegiate education at Harvard University.</p>
        <p>“We have heard of splendid sacrifices at the shrine
of philanthropy; aged men, on quitting the stage of
mortal existence, have bequeathed large endowments
to public charities, and princely legacies to religious
<pb id="color236" n="236"/>
and moral institutions. But where shall we find an
instance of the kind attributable to a man of Mr.
Minge's age? The case, we believe, is without a
parallel.”</p>

        <p>A POOR chimney sweeper's boy was employed at the
house of a lady of rank to sweep the chimney of the
room in which she usually dressed. When finding
himself on the hearth of a richly-furnished dressing.
room, and perceiving no one there, he waited a few
moments to take a view of the beautiful things in the
apartment.</p>
        <p>A gold watch, richly set with diamonds, particularly
caught his attention, and he could not forbear taking
it in his hand. Immediately the wish rose in his
mind, “Ah! if you had such a one!” After a
pause, he said to himself, “But if I take it I shall be
a thief; and yet,” continued he, “nobody would know
it; nobody sees me—nobody! Does not God see me,
who is present everywhere?” Overcome by these
thoughts, a cold shivering seized him. “No,” said
he, putting down the watch, “I would much rather
be poor, and keep my good conscience, than rich and
become a rascal.” At these words he hastened back
into the chimney.</p>
        <pb id="color237" n="237"/>
        <p>The lady, who was in the room adjoining, having
overheard the conversation with himself, sent for him
the next morning, and thus accosted him: “My little
friend, why did you not take the watch yesterday?”
The boy fell on his knees, speechless and astonished.
“I heard every thing you said,” continued her
ladyship; “thank God for enabling you to resist this
temptation, and be watchful over yourself for the
future: from this moment you shall be in my service:
I will both maintain and clothe you: nay, more,
procure you good instruction, which will assist to guard
you front the danger of similar temptations.”</p>
        <p>The boy burst into tears; he was anxious to express
his gratitude, but could not. The lady strictly kept
her promise, and had the pleasure of seeing this poor
<hi rend="italics">chimney-sweeper</hi> grow up a good, pious and intelligent
man.</p>
        <p>An Indian, being among his white neighbors, asked
for a little tobacco to smoke, and one of them, having
some loose in his pocket, gave him a handful. The
day following the Indian came back, inquiring for
the donor, saying he had found a quarter of a dollar
among the tobacco. Being told that as it was given
him he might as well keep it, he answered, pointing to
his breast, “I got a good man, and a bad man here, and
the good man say, ‘It ain't yours; you must return it
to its owner:’ the bad man say, ‘Why, he gave it to
you, and it is your own now:’ the good man say,
‘That's not right; the tobacco is yours, not the

money:’ the bad man say, ‘Never mind, you got it,
go buy some dram:’ the good man say, ‘No, you
must not do so:’ so I don't know what to do, and I
think I go to sleep; but the good man and the bad
keep talking all night, and trouble me; and now I
bring the money back I feel good.”</p>
        <p>Another Indian related, that, having got some
money, he was, on his way home, tempted to stop at a
tavern and buy some rum; “But,” said he, pointing
to his breast, “I have a good boy and a bad boy
here; and the good boy say, ‘John, don't you stop
there: the bad one say, ‘Poh, John, never mind, you
love a good dram:’ the good boy say, ‘No, John,
you know what a fool you made yourself when you
got drunk there before, don't do so again.’ When I
come to the tavern, the bad boy say, ‘ Come, John,
take one dram; it won't hurt you:’ the good one
say, ‘No, John, if you take one dram, then you take
another:’ then I don't know what to do, and the good
boy say, ‘Run, John, hard as you can’—so I run
away, and then, be sure, I feel very glad.”</p>

        <head>THE GOOD OLD INDIAN.</head>
        <p>CAPTAIN JAMES SMITH relates, that he was taken
prisoner by the Indians in the year 1755, and lived
several years among them. At one time, he lived with
<pb id="color239" n="239"/>
an old man named Tecaughretanego, and his little son,
Nunganny; they were quite alone, and there were not
any inhabitants for many miles around. The old man
was too lame to go out hunting; it was winter; they
had no victuals; the snow was on the ground, and so
frozen as to make a great noise when walked on,
which frightened away the deer, and the captain
could not shoot anything for some time.</p>
        <p>He says: “After I had hunted two days without
eating anything, and had very short allowance for
some days before, I returned late in the evening
faint and weary. When I came into our hut, the old
man asked what success. I told him not any. He
asked me if I was not very hungry. I replied that
the keen appetite seemed in some measure abated, but
I was both faint and weary.</p>
        <p>“He commanded his little son to bring me
something to eat; and he brought me a kettle with some
bones and broth. After eating a few mouthfuls my
appetite violently returned, and I thought the
victuals had a most agreeable relish, though it was only
fox and wildcat bones, which lay about the ground,
which the ravens and turkey-buzzards had picked;
these Nunganny had collected, and boiled until the
sinews that remained on them would strip off. I
speedily finished my allowance, and when I had ended
my <hi rend="italics">sweet</hi> repast the old man asked me how I felt. I
told him I was much refreshed.</p>
        <p>“He then handed me his pipe and pouch, and told
me to take a good smoke. I did so. He then said
<pb id="color240" n="240"/>
he had something of importance to tell me, if I was
now composed and ready to hear it. I told him I
was ready to hear him. He said, ‘The reason why I
deferred my speech till now is because few men are
in a right humor to hear good talk when they are
very hungry, as they are then generally fretful and
discomposed; but as you now appear to enjoy calmness
and serenity of mind, I will communicate to you
the thoughts of my heart, and those things I know to
be true.</p>
        <p>“ ‘Brother, as you have lived with the white people,
you have not had the same advantage of knowing
that the great Being above feeds His people, and gives
them their meat in due season, as we Indians have,
who are frequently out of provisions, and yet are
wonderfully supplied, and that so frequently that it
is evidently the hand of the Great Spirit that does
this; whereas, the white people have commonly large
stocks of tame cattle, that they can kill when they
please; and they also have barns and cribs, filled with
grain, and therefore have not the same opportunity
of seeing that they are supported by the Ruler of
heaven and earth.</p>
        <p>“ ‘Brother, I know you are now afraid that we will
all perish with hunger, but you have no just reason
to fear this. I have been young, but I am now old.
I have been frequently under the like circumstances
that we now are, and some time or another in almost
every year of my life; yet I have hitherto been
supported, and my wants supplied in time of need.
<pb id="color241" n="241"/>
“ ‘Brother, the Good Spirit sometimes suffers us
to be in want, in order to teach us our dependence on
Him, and to let us know that we are to love and serve
Him; likewise to know the worth of the favors that
we receive, and also to make us thankful.</p>
        <p>“ ‘Brother, be assured that you will be supplied
with food, and that just in the right time: but you
must continue diligent in the use of means: go to
sleep, and rise early in the morning, and go a hunting
—be strong, and exert yourself, like a man, and
the Great Spirit will direct your way.’ ”</p>
        <p>The captain was thus encouraged to try again the
next morning, though much disheartened and
extremely hungry. He went a great distance before he
could shoot anything; but at length he shot a buffalo
cow; thus finding, as the good old Indian had said,
that the Great Spirit had enabled him to provide for
them just at the time of their distress.</p>

the abodes of the aged and the infirm, do we find

up something for old age,” etc.</p>

        <head>AFRICAN SCHOOLS IN NEW YORK</head>
        <p>THE Clarkson Association, for instructing adult
females of color, commenced in the spring of 1811,
and was conducted ten or twelve years by a number
of young ladies of the Society of Friends. This was
the first institution that came under the appellation
of Sabbath-school in this city, where there are now so
many.</p>
        <p>It was taught on that day, because those people
had generally more leisure to attend than on other
days of the week; but these benevolent ladies soon
appropriated also one afternoon in the middle of the
week, for such as were at liberty to attend. There
were a considerable number of aged women, as well as
those in the prime of life, who learned to read, and
<pb id="color243" n="243"/>
rejoiced greatly in the acquisition. There were also
schools kept by young men, for adults of color of the
other sex.</p>
        <p>“There is one remarkable fact connected with the
effects of this excellent school upon the moral
condition of the colored people. At every term of the
Court of Sessions in this city, there are many colored
persons convicted of crimes, and sent to the State
prison or penitentiary. This school has now been in
operation a number of years, and several thousands of
scholars have received the benefits of a good thorough
English education, <hi rend="italics">and but three persons who have
been educated here have been convicted in our criminal
courts</hi>.”</p>
        <p>Several girls, who have received their education at
this school, have gone with their parents to Hayti,
where they will be capable of teaching schools, and
may be of singular benefit. Two interesting letters,

these girls about fourteen years old, have been
received by E. J. Cox; extracts from which are here

        <head>THE INJURED AFRICANS.
FROM THE NEW YORK OBSERVER—1826.</head>
        <p>IN our paper of the 21st of January we inserted a
communication from a correspondent giving an
account of an aged colored woman who emigrated with
her husband from New Orleans to this city last
summer, bringing with her another colored woman whom
she had rescued from slavery at the expense of <hi rend="italics">her
little all</hi>. The object of these poor people in coming
to New York was simply to enjoy the privileges of
gospel without interruption.</p>
        <p>A benevolent gentleman of our acquaintance whose
feelings were much interested in the account which we
published, and who has since repeatedly visited this
interesting family, has put into our hands the following
particulars of their history for publication. The name
of the husband is <hi>Reuben</hi>, that of his wife, <hi rend="italics">Betsey</hi>, and
that of their companion, <hi rend="italics">Fanny</hi>.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">Reuben Madison</hi>, the husband, was born in
Virginia, near Port Royal, about the year 1781. His
parents, and all his connections in this country, were
slaves. His father died when he was about seven
years old. His mother is now living in Kentucky,
enjoying freedom in her old age, through the filial
regard of Reuben, who purchased her liberty for seventy
dollars. She is seriously disposed, but not a professor
of religion.</p>
        <pb id="color246" n="246"/>
        <p>He has now eight brothers and sisters living in
Frankfort, Franklin county, Kentucky, all slaves, and
all, excepting one, members of a Baptist church in
that place. About a year after his conversion Reuben
was married to a slave, who had been kidnapped
in Maryland and sold to a planter in his neighborhood.
She was also hopefully pious.</p>
        <p>While they lived together she became the mother of
two children; but about four years after their marriage
she and one of the children, aged eight months,
were sold without his knowledge, and transported to a
distant Spanish territory, and with so much secrecy
that he had no opportunity even to bid her a last farewell.
“This,” said he, “was the severest trial of my
life, a sense of sin only excepted. I mourned and
cried, and would not be comforted.</p>
        <p>“After several months, however, the hope of meeting
her and my children again in the kingdom of God,
when we should never be separated, together with a
promise from my master that I should at some future
time go to see her, in some measure allayed my grief,
and permitted me to enjoy the consolations of religion.”
The other child is now a slave in Kentucky, though the
father has often endeavored in vain to purchase his
freedom.</p>
        <p>About six years since, having hired his time of his
master for five years previous, at 120 dollars a year,
Reuben succeeded, by trafficking in rags, and in other
ways, in collecting a sum sufficient for the purchase of
his own freedom, for which he paid 700 dollars, and
<pb id="color247" n="247"/>
not only so, but he was enabled, with his surplus earnings,
to build a brick house, and to provide it with
convenient accommodations. By the dishonesty of
his former master, however, all was taken from
him.</p>
        <p>Thus stripped of his property, he left Kentucky and
went to New Orleans, that he might learn something
from his wife, and, if possible, find and redeem her;
but he only succeeded in gaining the painful intelligence
that she was dead. He there formed an acquaintance
with his present wife, whose former name
was Betsey Bond, and they were soon married. The
circumstances of her life were briefly these:</p>
        <p>Betsey was born a slave, near Hobb's Hole, Essex
county, Virginia, about 1763, and was married to a
slave at about the age of twenty years. By him she
had three children, one of which, together with
her husband, died a few years after their marriage.
Soon after their death, she was led to reflect on her
lost state as a sinner, and after about seven months of
deep anxiety was enabled, as she trusts, to resign
herself into the hands of her Saviour, and experience
those consolations which He deigns to grant to the
broken-hearted penitent.</p>
        <p>She gained the confidence and attachment of her
mistress, who treated her with much kindness, and she
was married to a pious servant of the family, where
she remained about nine years. At the close of this
period a planter from the vicinity of Natchez, coming
to Alexandria in Virginia, where she then lived, for
<pb id="color248" n="248"/>
slaves, she was sold, and carried, with eight others, to
his plantation, leaving her husband behind.</p>
        <p>Her new master treated her with great severity,
and she was compelled to labor almost incessantly
every day of the week, Sabbath not excepted. With
this man she lived nineteen years. He then dies, and
left his slaves, by will, to another planter, who also
dying soon after, she was again sold and transported
to New Orleans, where she arrived about the year
1812.</p>
        <p>At the end of two years this master also died;
and when his slaves were about to be sold, Betsey
succeeded with some difficulty in hiring her time, and
in a little more than a year, by washing and other
labor, she acquired sufficient property to purchase her
freedom, for which she paid 250 dollars. Her youngest
son and his wife being also slaves in New Orleans,
she hoped to obtain, by her industry and economy,
money sufficient to purchase them also; but their
master refused to part with them.</p>
        <p>Several years after a large number of slaves were
brought to New Orleans from Virginia, and were
about to be offered for sale, and Fanny was among the
number. Having accidentally become acquainted
with her, previous to the sale, and finding her a sister
in Christ, Betsey's feelings were deeply interested, and
she resolved to purchase her, and to treat her not as
a slave, but as a child and companion.</p>
        <p>This determination she communicated to Fanny, and
with the aid of a gentleman she succeeded in accomplishing
<pb id="color249" n="249"/>
her object. The price was 250 dollars. She
paid 200, <hi rend="italics">her all</hi>, and obtained a short credit for the
remainder. Soon after this her present husband,
coming to New Orleans, as before stated, they were married,
and the payment for Fanny was then completed.</p>
        <p>By their united industry they were soon able to
build a comfortable house, in which they set apart a
room for religious purposes. Here they assembled
with others every Sabbath, for the worship of God.
But being constantly exposed to disturbance in their
worship, they felt a great desire to go to a free State,
where they might enjoy religious privileges unmolested;
where they could unite with Christian
friends in social prayer and conversation, without
a soldier with a drawn sword stationed at their
door.</p>
        <p>They fixed upon New York as the desired asylum;
and having arranged their concerns, rented their house,
and collected their effects, they engaged and paid their
passage, which was seventy dollars, and sailed from
New Orleans about the 12th of July, 1825, with pleasing
anticipations, for a land of freedom and religious
privileges.</p>
        <p>They suffered much on the voyage, through the cruelty
of the captain; being exposed without shelter,
during the whole of the passage, either on deck or in
the longboat. In consequence of this exposure, both
of the women were taken sick; and in this condition
they arrived at New York, and were landed on the
<pb id="color250" n="250"/>
wharf in a land of strangers, their money almost
expended, and none to commiserate their sufferings.</p>
        <p>After a few days, however, Reuben succeeded in
obtaining a miserable cellar in Chapel Street, at sixty
dollars annual rent, where he remained for some time,
supporting the family in their sickness, by his labor
as a shoemaker, and by the sale of some of his effects.</p>
        <p>On his arrival at this port his first act was to grant
entire freedom to Fanny, giving her liberty to live
with him, or to go where she pleased. She chose to
remain with him; and she assisted in the support
of the family by washing and other labor, and nursed
her mistress, who was evidently declining with the
consumption, occasioned doubtless by the severity of
her treatment on the passage from New Orleans.</p>
        <p>Not being able to pay their rent in advance, owing
to their sickness and other expenses, their landlord
compelled them to quit their residence; and they have
since been obliged to put up with still more miserable
accommodations in a cellar in Elm Street.</p>
        <p>They appeared to put their trust and confidence in
God, and expressed their entire belief that all their
trials were designed for their good. They seemed to
be one in sentiment and feeling, and to manifest a
spirituality of mind rarely to be found. Every little
attention was most gratefully received, and the best
of blessings were implored on him who bestowed it.</p>
        <p>With some assistance from the benevolent, and with
what they may receive from New Orleans for rent, it
is believed they may be provided with a comfortable
<pb id="color251" n="251"/>
house, and be introduced to those privileges which they
so ardently desire. No one of the family can read,
though they are all desirous to learn, and from a little
attention which their friends have given them it
appears that they may be taught without difficulty.</p>
        <p>It is an affecting thought, that the wrongs of this
poor woman, which commenced at her birth, and were
inflicted without interruption during the long years of
slavery, still followed her on her passage to the land
of freedom, and have been finally consummated in this
city, the city of her hopes, her fancied asylum from
the oppressor.</p>

        <head>HENRY BOYD.
</head>
        <bibl>FROM THE ANTI-SLAVERY RECORD.</bibl>
        <p>HENRY BOYD was born a slave in Kentucky. Of
imposing stature, well-knit muscles, and the countenance
of one of nature's noblemen. At the age of
eighteen he had so far won the confidence of his
master, that he not only consented to sell him the
right and title to his freedom, but gave him his own
time to earn the money.</p>
        <p>With a general pass from his master, Henry made
his way to the Kenhawa salt works, celebrated as the
place where Senator Ewing, of Ohio, chopped out his
<hi rend="italics">education</hi> with his axe! And there, too, with his axe,
did Henry Boyd chop out his <hi rend="italics">liberty</hi>. By performing
<pb id="color252" n="252"/>
double labor, he got double wages. In the daytime
he swung his axe upon the wood, and for half the
night he tended the boiling salt-kettles, sleeping the
other half by their side.</p>
        <p>After having accumulated a sufficient sum, he
returned to his master and paid it over for his freedom.
He next applied himself to learn the trade of a carpenter
and joiner. Such was his readiness to acquire
the use of tools, that he soon qualified himself to
receive the wages of a journeyman. In Kentucky prejudice
does not forbid master mechanics to teach colored
men their trades.</p>
        <p>He now resolved to quit the domains of slavery
and try his fortunes in a free State, and accordingly
directed his steps to the city of Cincinnati. The
journey reduced his purse to the last <hi rend="italics">quarter of a dollar</hi>;
but, with his tools on his back and the consciousness
of his ability to use them, he entered the
city with a light heart. Little did he dream of the
reception he was to meet. There was work enough
to be done in his line, but no master workman would
employ a colored man.</p>
        <p>Day after day did Henry Boyd offer his services
from shop to shop, but as often was he repelled,
generally with an insult, and once with a kick. At last, he
found the shop of an Englishman, too recently arrived
to understand the grand peculiarity of American feeling.
This man put a plane into his hand, and asked
him to make proof of his skill. “This is in bad order,”
said Boyd, and with that he gave the instrument
<pb id="color253" n="253"/>
certain nice professional knocks with the hammer,
till he brought it to suit his practised eye.</p>
        <p>“Enough,” said the Englishman; “I see you can use
tools.” Boyd, however, proceeded to dress a board in
a very able and workmanlike manner, while the journeymen
from a long line of benches gathered around
with looks that bespoke a deep personal interest in the
matter. “You may go to work,” said the master of
the shop, right glad to employ so good a workman.
The words had no sooner left his mouth than his
American journeymen, unbuttoning their aprons,
called, as one man, for the settlement of their
wages.</p>
        <p>“What! what!” said the amazed Englishman,
“what does this mean?” “It means that we will
not work with <hi rend="italics">a nigger</hi>,” replied the journeymen.
“But he is a first-rate workman.” “But we won't
stay in the same shop with <hi rend="italics">a nigger</hi>; we are not in
the habit of working with <hi rend="italics">niggers</hi>.” “Then I will
build a shanty outside, and he shall work in that.”
“No, no; we won't work for a <hi rend="italics">boss</hi> who employs <hi rend="italics">niggers</hi>.
Pay us up, and we'll be off.” The poor master
of the shop turned with a despairing look to Boyd—
“You see how it is, my friend; my workmen will all
leave me. I am sorry for it, but I can't hire you.”</p>
        <p>Even at this repulse our adventurer did not despair.
There might still be mechanics in the outskirts
of the city who had few too journeymen to be bound
by their prejudices. His quarter of a dollar had long
since disappeared, but, by carrying a traveller's trunk
<pb id="color254" n="254"/>
or turning his hand to any chance job, he contrived
to exist till he had made application to every carpenter
and joiner in the city and its suburbs. <hi rend="italics">Not one
would employ him</hi>. By this time, the iron of
prejudice, more galling than anything he had ever known
of slavery, had entered his soul.</p>
        <p>He walked down to the river's bank below the city,
and throwing himself upon the ground, gave way to
an agony of despair. He had found himself the object
of universal contempt; his plans were all frustrated,
his hopes dashed, and his dear-bought freedom made
of no effect! By such trials, weak minds are
prostrated in abject and slavish servility, and stronger
ones are made the enemies and depredators of society;
it is only the highest class of moral heroes that come
off like gold from the furnace.</p>
        <p>Of this class, however, was Henry Boyd. Recovering
from his dejection, he surveyed the brawny muscles
that strung his Herculean frame. A new design
rushed into his mind, and new resolution filled his
heart. He sprang upon his feet and walked firmly
and rapidly towards the city, doubtless with aspirations
that might have suited the words of the poet:</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“Thy spirit, <hi rend="italics">Independence</hi>, let me share,</l>
          <l>Lord of the lion heart and eagle eye.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>The first object which attracted his “eagle eye,” on
reaching the city, was one of the huge river boats
laden with pig iron, drawn up to the landing. The
captain of this craft was just inquiring of the merchant
<pb id="color255" n="255"/>
who owned its contents for a hand to assist in unloading
it. “I am the very fellow for you,” said Boyd,
stripping off his coat, rolling up his sleeves, and laying
hold of the work. “Yes, sure enough, that <hi rend="italics">is</hi> the
very fellow for you,” said the merchant.</p>
        <p>The resolution and alacrity of Boyd interested him
exceedingly, and during the four or five days in which
a flotilla of boats were discharging their cargoes of pig
iron with unaccustomed despatch, he became familiar
with his history, with the exception of all that
pertained to his trade, which Boyd thought proper to
keep to himself. In consequence, our adventurer next
found himself promoted to the portership of the
merchant's store, a post which he filled to great
satisfaction.</p>
        <p>He had a hand and a head for everything, and an
occasion was not long wanting to prove it. A joiner
was engaged to erect a counter, but failing, by a drunken
frolic, the merchant was disappointed and vexed.
Rather in passion than in earnest, he turned to his
faithful porter: “Here, Henry, you can do almost
anything, why can't <hi rend="italics">you</hi> do this job?” “Perhaps
I could, sir, if I had my tools and the stuff,” was the
reply. “Your tools!” exclaimed the merchant in
surprise, for till now he knew nothing of his trade.</p>
        <p>Boyd explained that he had learned the trade of a
carpenter and joiner, and had no objection to try the
job. The merchant handed him the money, and told
him to make as good a counter as he could. The work
was done with such promptitude, judgment and finish
<pb id="color256" n="256"/>
that his employer broke off a contract for the erection
of a large frame warehouse, which he was about closing
with the same mechanic who had disappointed him
in the matter of the counter, and gave the job to
Henry.</p>
        <p>The money was furnished, and Boyd was left to
procure the materials and <hi rend="italics">boss</hi> the job at his own
discretion. This he found no difficulty in doing, and
what is remarkable, among the numerous journeymen
whom he employed, were some of the very men who
took off their aprons at his appearance in the Englishman's
shop! The merchant was so much pleased with
his new warehouse, that he proceeded to set up the
intelligent builder in the exercise of his trade in the city.</p>
        <p>Thus Henry Boyd found himself raised at once
almost beyond the reach of the prejudice which had
well-nigh crushed him. He built houses and
accumulated property. White journeymen and apprentices
were glad to be in his employment, and to <hi rend="italics">sit at
his table</hi>. He is now a wealthy mechanic, living in
his own house in Cincinnati; and his enemies who
have tried to supplant him have as good reason is his
friends to know that he is a man of sound judgment
and a most vigorous intellect.</p>
        <p>Without having received a day's schooling in his
life, Henry Boyd is well read in history, has an
extensive and accurate knowledge of geography, is an
excellent arithmetician, and is remarkable for his morality,
generosity, and all those traits which mark a noble
character.</p>

        <head>QUAMINO BUCCAN,
<lb/>
A PIOUS METHODIST.</head>
        <p>QUAMINO was born in the vicinity of New Brunswick,
New Jersey, in 1762, and was a slave. In his
ninth year he was hired for a term of years to a person
named Schenk, who employed him as a house-servant,
and who soon after removing to Poughkeepsie,
New York, took the lad with him. The unsettled
state of the country during the Revolutionary War,
prevented communication with his old master, and
Quamino had no hope of seeing his former friends;
but in his eightieth year he was informed that his
master had sent for him. On his return to New
Jersey his old associates had so grown that he felt
like a stranger in his old home.</p>
        <p>When nearing the age of manhood he was steady
in attending religious meetings, walking several miles
through all kinds of weather. His own account of
his motive in going was that he “liked to have the
name of being a good boy.” But whatever his motive
in going, the meetings were a blessing to him. One
Sabbath evening on reaching home he went to the
barn, where, after earnest exercise in prayer, he slept
upon the straw. Very early in the morning he went
into the field to work, first kneeling by the fence.
Being in great distress, the gracious words of the
Saviour deeply impressed him: “<hi rend="italics">Let not your heart
be troubled. Ye believe in God, believe also in Me</hi>.”
<pb id="color258" n="258"/>
Yielding his whole heart and all his powers to Him
who was calling for the sacrifice, he felt that he
received the unspeakable gift.</p>
        <p>He went to his work; “and oh,” said he, “everything
was glorious around me—everything seemed to
be praising God.”</p>
        <p>The change which had come over the boy was
conspicuous to all around him; he was quiet and
diligent in attention to all his duties. From this
time Quamino understood the nature of that peace
“which passeth all understanding.” On the Sabbath
he would get the carriage ready, and when his master
had started he would walk several miles across the
fields to the Methodist meeting, but always left before
the conclusion of the services, as, if not at home in
time to take the horses when the family arrived, he
was sure to be found fault with, if not punished.</p>
        <p>At the age of twenty-six he married Sarah, a slave
on a neighboring place. She was soon sold to a
distance of five miles, and for some years they only met
once a week. One Sabbath morning he went to see
her, and found that she and her infant had been sold,
leaving her little son, a boy nearly four years old.
She now had a hard master; but, through the efforts
of her husband, she was purchased by a neighbor,
and, at length, by the removal of this purchaser,
Quamino induced his second master (to whom he had
been sold when about thirty years old) to buy her.
Afterwards Dr. Griffith bought Quamino for $250, and
Sarah for $150.</p>
        <pb id="color259" n="259"/>
        <p>At the death of Dr. Griffith his goods and chattels
(including his slaves) were advertised to be sold at
public auction. The sale commenced, and Quamino
and Sarah became objects of much attention; but a
letter was received from Wm. Griffith, the son and
executor of the late master, directing that everything
should be sold to the highest bidder except the
carriage and horse, and that with these Quamino should
bring Sarah to Burlington. “Oh, my dear friend,”
said he in narrating it, “you do not know how I
felt.”</p>
        <p>Wm. Griffith was not only an eminent lawyer but
bore a part in originating the New Jersey Abolition
Society. For this excellent man, whose “record is
on high,” Quamino worked to the best of his ability.
One day, as he was at work in the garden, he heard
his name called, and seeing his master beside him, he
modestly said, “Sir!” We will describe what took
place in the good old man's words. Says he:</p>
        <p>“Would you like to be free?” and I said, “I don't
know, sir.” He stood in silence a little while, and I
went on working the same as before. At last he
said, ‘I've made up my mind to give you free;’ and
says I, ‘you give me free, master?’ Oh, it all came
on me so unexpected! And then he up and told me
all how he would do: ‘When I call you, you must take
your wife by the hand and come into my office.’ One
day he called me to bring my wife. I went in the
kitchen, and said, ‘Mother, Mr. Griffith says you
must come along with me to the office.’ She stroked
<pb id="color260" n="260"/>
her apron, and we went, and found the office full of
gentlemen, and there we stood as if we were just
married.” After answering some questions they went
back to their work, and their certificate of freedom was
recorded in the clerk's office in Burlington. They were
then hired at ten dollars a month. Quamino was
then forty-four years old. When asked by some of
his old friends, if he was happier since he received his
freedom, he said, “I don't know much about freedom,
but I would'nt be a slave again if you'd give me the
best farm in the Jarsies.”</p>
        <p>In the year 1842, when he was eighty years old,
his wife died suddenly. As the remains of Sarah
were borne from their humble home, he stood at the
door, supported by his crutches, the tears streaming
down his cheeks. “Farewell,” said he, “I shall see
her no more, till we meet within the Pearl Gates.”
Sarah was not inferior to her husband, to whom she
was a helper in spiritual and temporal things. He
felt this bereavement keenly, his situation without her
was forlorn. Living alone in his house, too feeble to
dress himself, his son, who was out at service, would
put him to bed at night, and come in the morning to
dress him. Arrangements were made by several
families to furnish him with dinner, each taking a
particular day; and this plan was pursued for eight
years. His landlord supplied his morning and evening
meal, until Quamino's sight entirely failed, when
a faithful care-taker was provided for him.</p>
        <p>Charles Taber, a Friend and a Minister, from Canada,
<pb id="color261" n="261"/>
visited him one morning, and was fervently engaged
in prayer. When he rose from his knees Quamino
exclaimed, “Now I know that my prayer was heard.
Dis morning, after blessing and praising de Master
for taking care of me through de night, I asked Him
to please to send me something to comfort me through
the day, and now He sent you to me, oh, my dear
friend!”</p>
        <p>Speaking of the evidence of evil around us, he said,
“God is His own interpreter and my comforter, and
He will make all things plain.” Referring to his
pains, he said, “The Lord is the physician—He has
a balm for every wound. It seems, as I sit here, I
have a view over Jordan. We must pass Jordan's
swelling flood, and then we'll be in the promised
land.”</p>
        <p>In reference to his blindness, he said, that with
his natural sight and comprehension he had never
been able to conceive the half of the glory which
should be revealed, or to form a conception of the
“good things” held in store even for so poor a creature
as he felt himself to be. “How long I have to
remain in this state,” he exclaimed, “the Lord
knows. I resign myself in His hands, and to His
wisdom. Oh, the Lord moves with me so beautiful!
I trust the Lord has enabled me to seek and to find
His face and favor.”</p>
        <p>Being inquired of concerning his health, he replied,
“That he could not wish to be better—that he was
so composed in mind, so calm and peaceable. Oh,
<pb id="color262" n="262"/>
the glorious prospect I have in view. I can't see
anything of this world, but there seems to be a
hovering around me. If the heart is composed to His
will, what can trouble us? Blessed Master, please
to give me an insight into Thy will.” He spoke of
the comfort and strength which is afforded him to
hear the Holy Scriptures read.</p>
        <p>“Oh,” said he, “if I could only find words to
express the feelings I have when I am alone—and yet
I do not feel that I am alone either. He cares for
us and provides for us; but He is all in all, and over
all; He leads us by His spirit; He don't compel us,
but enables us. Oh, my blessed Saviour, teach me,
oh, teach me the measure of my days, that I may turn
my thoughts more to it. But I trust in the Lord
that He will prepare me and keep me to the end.”</p>
        <p>Wm. J. Allinson called on him one morning. He
found the old man, who was 108 years of age, sitting
in his chair; he gave his visitor an earnest welcome,
and his tongue was eloquent with rejoicing praises
of Him who had made him meet for an inheritance
with the saints in light. “Glory be to my blessed
Master,” he cried again and again, clasping his hands
like an artless and overjoyed child. On this occasion,
and indeed in almost every interview, he devoutly
expressed his thankfulness that, although deprived of
sight, his reason and memory were spared him; and
this was remarkably the case to the last moment of
existence.</p>
        <p>“My dear friend has been to visit me once more,”
<pb id="color263" n="263"/>
he exclaimed repeatedly after this parting. This was
his last conversation with any one, except a few words
to his son and his attendant. In the night he called
his son, and with his mental powers apparently clear
to the last, and conscious that his end had arrived,
his purified and enfranchised spirit deserted the clay
tenement; and who can doubt his welcome into the
joy of the Lord?</p>
        <p>A few weeks afterwards a sermon relating to
Quamino was preached by the pastor of the Methodist
congregation to which this aged Christian belonged.
The text was, “This poor man cried, and the Lord
heard him, and delivered him out of all his troubles.”
Psalm xxxiv. 6.</p>
        <lg type="psalm">

        <head>THE FREEDMEN OF AMERICA.</head>
        <p>DURING the four years' war commencing 1861 the
colored people fled from bondage, and gathered in
large numbers around Washington, and in those parts
of Virginia which were in possession of the United
States Government. Sometimes one thousand
refugees came to the freedmen's settlement in a week,
and most of them had travelled on foot for several
days, with scant food and clothing. They rejoiced
greatly when they arrived at a place of refuge, and
became free men and women. The able-bodied men
were employed by the Government, but the sick and
aged, the women and children, were cared for by
different benevolent associations of the churches at the
North and West. The Religious Society of Friends
always cherished a deep feeling for the enslaved people
of color, and after sending agents to ascertain the
condition of the freedmen in the camps and quarters
assigned to them by the Government, they earnestly
labored to feed, clothe and teach those for whom they
had long solicited the boon of freedom.</p>
        <p>Believing some incidents and anecdotes from letters
received from the agents of Friends will be interesting
to many, the following extracts are presented:</p>
        <p>“It is difficult to make a connected account of our
visit among the freedmen at Washington and
elsewhere. We went into their cabins, the tents, and the
hospitals, looking into the condition of the poor
<pb id="color265" n="265"/>
people congregated there. Their stories may be considered
almost trifling in themselves, and yet summed up as
a whole—a people's history—they tell the oft-repeated
tale of sorrow, degradation, and oppression in slavery;
of hunger and cold, of sickness and suffering, patiently
and uncomplainingly borne, in their great struggle
for freedom. Every sacrifice, every privation seems
insignificant compared to the blessed boon of liberty,
to them and to their children. ‘The good Lord Jesus
has at last heard our prayers and sent Uncle Abram
to set us free.’</p>
        <p>“They come to the Union as little children would
to a parent, with perfect confidence that they will be
helped. The younger women mostly had their children
with them, but the older ones had all come off
‘wid 'lations and friends.’ In a severe snow-storm
one thousand arrived, with only the clothes on their
backs. Their utter poverty is terrible. During this
storm we had not clothes for the children, who were
crying to get out of bed. Nine hundred came
yesterday—all ragged; their masters had not given them
clothes, some for a year, others for two years. All
beg for Bibles.”</p>
        <div2>
          <p>“The rope-walk is a very long building divided
into cabins; it is where the refugees come at first.
In each cabin live four or five families. It is the
most interesting place to visit. There are over five
hundred people there, fresh from slave-life, and
<pb id="color266" n="266"/>
rejoicing over their freedom. Not being able to read,
they often burst out as we are reading to them with,
‘Well, I never heard that before.’</p>
          <p>“The beautiful doctrine of the golden rule seems
almost new to them. It is true the religious element
is very strong in them, but their manner of receiving
it is very different from our ideas. Although they
may be what they call converted, they need plain
words of moral truth for every-day life. They have
plenty of faith and thankfulness, but not Christ's law
of love in their hearts to govern every action.</p>
          <p>“We stopped at a church and witnessed one of
their religious excitements—women all rocking their
bodies and singing weird choruses; then some one
getting excited above the others, and throwing herself
about, jumping and screaming. We stayed until
they were out, and all down the aisles they sang and
shouted—real fine, full voices, and the words more
strange than all. All the women had that swaying
motion so peculiar to them.</p>
          <p>“The boxes were handed over to me on the 19th
of January. From that date to the 7th of May, I
have given out twenty-six hundred and twenty
garments, large and small. For the last ten days we
have been very busy. During the last engagement
on the battle-field, hundreds have come, more than
can possibly find shelter here. I have witnessed some

children. Husbands and wives, brothers and sisters,
meet after long separation. One good old
mother here found six of her children in one group.
One poor mother, with seven children, was inquiring
for her husband : the answer was, ‘he is dead!’
The small-pox left that record for this poor mother.</p>
          <p>“We saw one noble-looking man, not far from
seven feet high, in mere rags and bare feet. Our No.
12's looked like baby-shoes beside them; but I heard
of a pair of No. 19 at the Commissary, which they were
very glad to exchange. The old man had had a hard
master, and had been driven off ‘without food enough
to cover a pin.’ But I never saw such a flash of joy
as when I said, ‘But, uncle, you have such a <hi rend="italics">good</hi>,
<hi rend="italics">kind</hi> master now, and such a beautiful home up in
heaven.’ ‘Oh, missis, it's <hi rend="italics">that</hi>, it's jest <hi rend="italics">that</hi>, that's
'stained me all along.’ They all seemed so grateful,
and we had a happy day indeed.”</p>

          <p>“They learn surprisingly fast; they were very
anxious to learn to reckon. I said I would repeat
the multiplication table if they would try to remember
it. I repeated the 2's once, and they said it after
me in concert. I then questioned them, and though
they had never heard it before, quite a number
remembered the whole.</p>
          <p>“One little fellow in the school being asked if he
knew his letters, said, promptly, ‘Yes, ma'am.’</p>
          <pb id="color268" n="268"/>
          <p>“Well, What else do you know?</p>
          <p>“Drawing himself up to his full height, which might
be about four feet, he replied, ‘I know a heap.’</p>

          <p>“Freedman's Village, near Arlington, is really an
attractive-looking place; comfortable houses, nicely
white-washed; a school-house, capable of accommodating
two or three hundred children, and a ‘Home’
for the aged and infirm. Fervor and earnestness
pervade the sermons and prayers of the colored people
here. One gave thanks for ‘the glorious privilege
that we ain't all dead and shut up in hell.’</p>
          <p>“Some of us might not have realized before that it
<hi rend="italics">was</hi> a glorious privilege to be still left on earth, either
as faithful servants, to do the Master's bidding, or to
become reconciled to Him before we were snatched
away with no alternative but to be ‘shut up in hell.’</p>
          <p>“You would have been touched to witness their
grief at the death of our beloved President. Every
tenanted hut was decked with some badge of mourning.
Thousands went to look at their emancipator,
as he lay in state in the White House. Aunt Cicily,
who bore the yoke of slavery one hundred and ten
years, looked on Mr. Lincoln with a reverential feeling,
beautiful to behold in one so aged—‘for the
privilege,’ she says, ‘that he gave me to die free.’ ”</p>
          <pb id="color269" n="269"/>
          <p>“Some old men who had learned to read while in
slavery, said, ‘We toted massa's children to school,
stayed all day, and then toted them back. We learned
to read, and massa didn't know it; and now we can
read de blessed Book ourselves. De good people of
de North have been bery good, bery good to us.
Jesus tell dem to help de poor slave: by-and-by we
can help ourselves. We tank you all bery much!’
Mother, child, and grandchild sometimes go
hand-in-hand to the school-room. The stimulating motive
with most of the adults is a fervent desire to read the
Bible.”</p>

        <div2>
          <p>“The marriage record kept among the Freedmen,
shows that a large part of the marriages, especially at
first, were of those who had lived together as husband
and wife, perhaps many years, without an opportunity
to be legally united. One old man, of almost
three-score and ten, was thus joined in lawful
marriage to his venerable wife. At the conclusion of the
ceremony, when the pastor extended his hand with
the nuptial benediction, and dismissed them with a
short prayer, they dropped on their knees together,
their eyes streaming with tears of thankfulness, and
still kneeling, the old man reached out both arms and
hugged her to his heart, saying aloud, ‘My dear old
woman, I bless God that I can now, for the first time,
kiss my own lawful wife.’ ”</p>
          <pb id="color270" n="270"/>
          <p>An agent, under date 5th month, 1863, writes:</p>
          <p>“When I first wrote to thee, the supply of excellent
clothing, furnished by New York Friends, and
other quarters, seemed so ample that, to my eyes, the
subject of further need, did not suggest itself. I
thought the time must come when such wants must
be satisfied. But that time dawns not yet. The hospitals
for colored people are a heavy drain on the
clothing. Now, that that army advances, there are
daily arrivals of freedmen; they come with only the
clothing they have on, and must have a change to
preserve health.</p>

        <head>LETTERS FROM A LADY AGENT IN RICHMOND, 1866.</head>
        <p>“IN my jaunt to Deep Creek, and to the poor cabins
in Dismal Swamp, I helped mend six bridges before
our horse could cross, borrowing nails from the fence.
It was a very hard trip—no chance for a single dinner
while gone—but it paid. The same night I
mended bridges, I found work of a different kind.
Going on business to the Bute Street Church, I found
a love-feast under full headway: about two hundred
were present; the excitement terrible among the
young converts, who, in their frantic leaps, broke
lamps and windows, and filled the house with perfect
uproar. I found the new pastor dared not risk his
popularity by checking it. Courage was given me to
<pb id="color271" n="271"/>
make my way to the pulpit, when I at once had
permission to speak. All was still as need be, while
I appealed to their judgment, and the teachings of
the Bible. I saw I had the sympathy of most, and
when at last, I said, ‘wait till the wind, and the
earthquake, and the fire have all passed by, and then
go to your homes and listen to the still small voice by
which God himself will teach you; and oh,
remember, my young sisters, that the proof of your
growth in grace is not the <hi rend="italics">feelings</hi> you have here tonight,
but the <hi rend="italics">life</hi> you will lead to-morrow.’ There
was such an earnest ‘amen,’ all over the house, as
gave me hope again that they will rise above this great
delusion. Many came to thank me. ‘It was just
what we needed, and they will hear it from you.’ ”</p>
        <p>“Deeply impressed with the moral wants of these
poor creatures, especially the women, and their need
of friendly counsel in their new position, I have
opened Mother's meetings—now held weekly, in each
of our three-school districts—where they are invited
to come with their work and their babies. I talk
familiarly with them about their household matters,
the cheapest and most wholesome food, the best ways
of cooking it, and the right care of their children,
and their duties to their husbands—often being greatly
helped out in my own stock of knowledge by the
practical experience of some nice old aunty, who tells
how she manages, till the whole group is at ease and
can confide their troubles and trials. Then I read,
teach, or talk to them. Finally, all lay aside their
<pb id="color272" n="272"/>
work, and the babies are hushed up, while they listen
to a chapter from the Bible; and the devotional
pause at the close is solemn and impressive. Those
who cannot spare two or three hours, hurry in at the
last, and I hear them saying ‘I'se just goin' over to
prayers, 'pears like it gives me <hi rend="italics">such</hi> a lift.’</p>

        <head>A TEMPERANCE MEETING IN AFRICA.</head>
        <p>JAMES BACKHOUSE, an English Friend and a minister,
published a journal of his mission in Africa, in
which he says, under date of December 1st, 1838— </p>
        <p>This is the memorable day in which slavery ceased
in Cape Colony, South Africa. We arrived at Hankey
in time to join a considerable congregation of
those who had been in bondage—natives of Madagascar
and Mozambique, as well as home-born slaves;
they had come from the surrounding country to unite
with those on the mission station in praising God for
their deliverance from bondage. In the evening a
meeting was held, when several Hottentots (natives of
South Africa) and freedmen addressed the congregation.
The next day was “a Sabbath day,” and truly
“a high day.” About five hundred freed slaves and
Hottentots assembled early in the morning; they held
a prayer-meeting, in which the language of thanksgiving
was held forth by one lately in slavery, and appropriate
hymns were sung. I exhorted the liberated to
seek, through Jesus Christ, deliverance from that
<pb id="color275" n="275"/>
worst of bondage—slavery to sin. In the evening of
the third day a temperance tea-meeting was held in
the chapel. A suspended wheel-tire was struck for a
bell, to call them to assemble. The men sat at the
tables on one side of the chapel, and the women at
the other side; tea and cakes were dealt out by some
of the women. All were remarkably clean, and
conducted themselves with sober cheerfulness and looks
full of interest. After the Missionary had returned
thanks and made a brief address, it was my privilege
to follow him in recommending total abstinence from
intoxicating liquors. Several Hottentots and freed
slaves then addressed the meeting, which afterwards
adjourned for a short interval at milking time. On
re-assembling, George W. Walker spoke at some length,
and several others.</p>
        <p>At half-past ten the Missionary suggested that it
would be unseasonable to continue the meeting longer;
he therefore opened a book of signatures to the
total-abstinence pledge, and one hundred and sixty new
names were received. As neither my companion, G.
W. Walker, nor I had hitherto signed such a pledge,
we also added our names. A sweet sense of the love
of God overshadowed this meeting.</p>
        <p>Some attention had been paid to temperance from
the early institution of this settlement. The children
have so little idea of what drunkenness is, that in
1842, when an Englishman appeared in a state of
intoxication, some of them ran away, thinking he was
mad; others thought he must be ill because he
<pb id="color276" n="276"/>
staggered, but others feared he was blind, and offered
to lead him.</p>
        <p>At the expiration of a year from this period, only
one of the persons who signed the pledge on this day,
was known to have broken it, and that only to the
amount of taking a single glass of wine.</p>
